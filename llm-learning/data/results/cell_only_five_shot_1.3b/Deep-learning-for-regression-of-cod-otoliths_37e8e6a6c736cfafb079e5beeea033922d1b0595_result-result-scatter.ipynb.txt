    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that includes several cells. The first cell is a function that aggregates the predictions from a set of models. The second cell is a function that aggregates the predictions from a single model. The third cell is a function that calculates the correlation between different models. The last cell is a function that plots the correlation between different models.

    The function `aggregate_predsV2` aggregates the predictions from a set of models. It reads the predictions from a CSV file, calculates the accuracy and mean squared error for each model, and then aggregates the predictions.

    The function `plotCorrelation` plots the correlation between different models. It uses the Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall's Tau correlations to measure the strength and direction of the relationship between the models.
