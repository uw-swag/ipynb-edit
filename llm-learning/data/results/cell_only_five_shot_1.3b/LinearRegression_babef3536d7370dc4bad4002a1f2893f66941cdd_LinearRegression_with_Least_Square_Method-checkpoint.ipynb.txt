The code you provided is a simple linear regression model using the least square method. It reads a CSV file, calculates the mean of the X and Y values, and then uses the least square method to fit a line to the data. The line is then used to make predictions on new data. The code also includes a function to plot the original data and the predicted line.

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

- The `readfile` function reads a CSV file, calculates the mean of the X and Y values, and returns the X and Y values.
- The `buildModel` function calculates the slope (m) and y-intercept (c) of the line of best fit using the least square method.
- The `bestFitLine` function calculates the predicted Y values based on the slope and y-intercept.
- The `plotGraph` function plots the original data and the predicted line.
- The `predict` function uses the slope and y-intercept to predict the Y value for a given X value.

The code is then used to load the data, calculate the slope and y-intercept of the line of best fit, make predictions on new data, and plot the original data and the predicted line.

Please note that the code assumes that the CSV file 'salary_data.csv' is in the same directory as the script. If the file is located elsewhere, you will need to provide the full path to the file.
