    # LeNet Architecture

    # LeNet is a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture used for image classification tasks.
    # It consists of a series of convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers, and finally a softmax layer.

    # The LeNet model is composed of 5 layers:

    # 1. Convolutional Layer with 6 filters of size 5x5, stride 1, padding 0, and activation function ReLU.
    # 2. Max Pooling Layer with pool size 2x2, stride 2.
    # 3. Convolutional Layer with 16 filters of size 5x5, stride 1, padding 0, and activation function ReLU.
    # 4. Max Pooling Layer with pool size 2x2, stride 2.
    # 5. Flatten Layer.
    # 6. Fully Connected Layer with 120 outputs and activation function ReLU.
    # 7. Fully Connected Layer with 84 outputs and activation function ReLU.
    # 8. Fully Connected Layer with 10 outputs and activation function softmax.

    # The LeNet model is trained using the CIFAR-10 dataset, a commonly used dataset for image classification tasks.
    # The model is trained for 20 epochs, with a learning rate of 0.01.

    # The LeNet model's performance is evaluated using the accuracy metric, which measures the proportion of images that are correctly classified.
