```python
    import sys
    if sys.version_info[0] < 3:
        print("This script is running under Python 2.x. Please use Python 3.x.")
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        print("This script is running under Python 3.x.")
    ```

    ### Explanation:
    This code checks if the Python version is 2.x or 3.x. If it's 2.x, it prints a message and exits the program. If it's 3.x, it prints a message and continues the program. This is a simple way to check the Python version and handle the differences between Python 2 and 3.
