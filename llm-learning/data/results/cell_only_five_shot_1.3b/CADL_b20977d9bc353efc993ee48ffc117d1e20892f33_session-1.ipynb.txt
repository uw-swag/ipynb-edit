```python
    import tensorflow as tf

    subtraction = imgs - mean_img_4d

    # Now compute the standard deviation by calculating the
    # square root of the sum of squared differences
    std_img_op = tf.sqrt(tf.reduce_sum(subtraction * subtraction, reduction_indices=0))

    # Now calculate the standard deviation using your session
    std_img = sess.run(std_img_op)
