```python
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

    # Assuming you have a DataFrame df with a column 'tweet' containing the text of the tweets
    df = pd.DataFrame({
        'tweet': [
            'I love programming',
            'Python is awesome',
            'Data science is fun',
            'Machine learning is cool'
        ]
    })

    # Create a CountVectorizer object
    vectorizer = CountVectorizer()

    # Fit and transform the data
    X = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['tweet'])

    # Get the feature names
    feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()

    # Create a DataFrame with the feature names and their corresponding counts
    df_features = pd.DataFrame({
        'feature': feature_names,
        'count': X.toarray().sum(axis=0)
    })

    # Sort the DataFrame by count in descending order
    df_features = df_features.sort_values(by='count', ascending=False)

    # Print the DataFrame
    print(df_features)
    ```
    This code will create a DataFrame with the features (characters in the tweet) and their corresponding counts. The DataFrame is then sorted by count in descending order.
