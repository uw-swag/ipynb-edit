```
    # Run MLflow UI (NOT recommended! It will be more convenient to run it directly from the TERMINAL)
    #!mlflow ui
    ```

    ## Code Explanation
    The code above is a comment that runs the MLflow UI. The `#!` is a shell command that is used to run a command in a terminal. The `mlflow ui` command is used to start a web server that hosts a UI for viewing and managing experiments, models, and resources.

    The code is not recommended because it is not a valid command in a Jupyter notebook. The `#!` is used to run a command in a terminal, not a command in a Jupyter notebook. The `mlflow ui` command is a command that is used to start a web server that hosts a UI for viewing and managing experiments, models, and resources.

    The code should be replaced with:
    ```
    # Run MLflow UI (NOT recommended! It will be more convenient to run it directly from the TERMINAL)
    # mlflow ui
    ```
    This code will run the MLflow UI in a terminal.
