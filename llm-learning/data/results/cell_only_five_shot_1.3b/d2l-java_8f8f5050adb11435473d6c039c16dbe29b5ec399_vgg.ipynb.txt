    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook. It's using the Maven build system to download and install several libraries, including the Deep Java Library (DJL) for deep learning, and the MxNet library for deep learning.

    The issue you're facing is related to memory management in the VGG model. The code is fetching a large amount of data (1GB) in the `X` variable, which is then used to initialize the model. However, the memory used by `X` is not being released properly, leading to memory issues.

    The solution to this problem is to use a `NDManager` to allocate memory for the `X` variable. Here's how you can modify the code:

    ```java
    NDManager manager = NDManager.newBaseManager();
    NDArray X = manager.randomUniform(0f, 1.0f, new Shape(1, 1, 224, 224));
    trainer.initialize(X.getShape());
    ```

    In the above code, `NDManager.newBaseManager()` creates a new `NDManager` that uses the default memory manager. The `randomUniform()` method is used to create a new `NDArray` with the specified shape and fill it with random values.

    The `trainer.initialize(X.getShape())` method is then used to initialize the trainer with the shape of the `X` array.

    This should solve the memory issue you're facing.

    The code for the rest of the notebook is not provided, but it should work as expected.
