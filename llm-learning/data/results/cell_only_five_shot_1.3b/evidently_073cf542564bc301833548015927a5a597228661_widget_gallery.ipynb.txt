```
    from evidently.dashboard import Dashboard
    from evidently.dashboard.tabs.widget_gallery_tab import WidgetGalleryTab

    import pandas as pd
    dashboard = Dashboard(tabs=[WidgetGalleryTab()])
    dashboard.calculate(pd.DataFrame([[1, 2],[1, 2],[1, 2]]), None, None)
    dashboard.save("widget_example.html")
    dashboard.show(mode="inline")
    ```

    The original code was removed as it was an example with an old API. The new code is a demonstration of how to create a dashboard and save it to an HTML file.
