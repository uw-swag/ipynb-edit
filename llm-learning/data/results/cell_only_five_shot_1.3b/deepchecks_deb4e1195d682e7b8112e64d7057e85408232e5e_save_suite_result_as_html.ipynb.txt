    ### Response:
    The code you've provided is a simple example of how to load the iris dataset from sklearn.datasets and print its data and target.

    The iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning, which contains measurements of 150 iris flowers from three different species. The dataset has 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and a target variable (species).

    The code is written in Python and uses the scikit-learn library, which is a popular machine learning library in Python.

    If you have any specific changes or updates you'd like to make, please provide more details.
