```python
    # Python code to demonstrate prompt injection

    import os

    # Function to execute command
    def execute_command(command):
        os.system(command)

    # Sample command
    command = "whoami"

    # Prompt injection
    command += "'"

    # Execute command
    execute_command(command)
    ```
    This code will execute the command "whoami" which will print the username of the current user. The command is then appended with a single quote, which is a common technique used to inject a command into a system.
