    The issue with the code is that the `tf.concat` function is concatenating along the first dimension (axis=1), not the second. The correct way to concatenate along the second dimension is to use `axis=0`.

    Here is the corrected code:

    ```python
    outputs_flat = tf.reshape(tf.concat(0, outputs), [-1, n_cells])
    ```

    In this code, `tf.concat(0, outputs)` concatenates the tensors along the second dimension (axis=0), which is the correct way to concatenate along the second dimension.
