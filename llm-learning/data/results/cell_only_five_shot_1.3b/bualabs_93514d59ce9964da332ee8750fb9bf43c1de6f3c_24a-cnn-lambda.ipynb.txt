    ## Comparing CPU and GPU Training Time

    The code above demonstrates how to compare the training time of a model on a CPU and a GPU. 

    The training time is measured using the `time.time()` function in Python, which returns the current time in seconds.

    The code first imports the necessary libraries and sets up the data. It then sets up the model, optimizer, and learner.

    The `CudaCallback` class is a custom callback function that is used to ensure that the model is moved to the GPU before training.

    The `run.fit(8, learn)` line trains the model for 8 epochs.

    The training time is measured using the `time.time()` function before and after the training. The difference is the training time on the CPU and the GPU.

    The results are then printed out.

    Please note that the actual training times may vary depending on the specific hardware and the specific model and dataset used.

    Also, the code assumes that the `get_cnn_model` function is defined elsewhere in the code, and that the `loss_func` and `max_lr` variables are defined elsewhere in the code.

    The code also assumes that the `fastai` library is installed and that the `datasets` module is imported.
