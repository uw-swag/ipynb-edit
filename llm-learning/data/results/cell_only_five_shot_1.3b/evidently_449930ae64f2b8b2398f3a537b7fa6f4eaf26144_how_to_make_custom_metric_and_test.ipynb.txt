    # How to make a custom metric and test

    # In this notebook, we will create a custom metric and a test for it.

    # Let's start with a simple example. We will create a custom metric that measures the number of positive values in a list.

    # First, we need to define the custom metric.

    def count_positive_values(y_true, y_pred):
        # This function takes two arguments: y_true and y_pred.
        # y_true is the true values, and y_pred is the predicted values.
        # The function returns the number of positive values.

        # We convert y_true and y_pred to numpy arrays, because sklearn's metrics expect them to be.

        y_true = np.array(y_true)
        y_pred = np.array(y_pred)

        # We count the number of positive values.

        count = np.sum(y_pred > 0)

        # We return the count.

        return count

    # Now, we can use this custom metric in a sklearn model.

    from sklearn.metrics import make_scorer

    # We create a scorer using our custom metric.

    scorer = make_scorer(count_positive_values, greater_is_better=False)

    # We can now use this scorer in a sklearn model.

    model = SomeModel()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, scoring=scorer)

    # Now, we can use this model to make predictions.

    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # We can also use this model to evaluate the performance of our custom metric.

    score = scorer(model, X_test, y_test)

    # This will give us the number of positive values predicted by our model.

    print(f"Number of positive values predicted: {score}")

    # This is a simple example. In practice, you would want to create a more complex custom metric.

    # You could also create a test for this custom metric.
