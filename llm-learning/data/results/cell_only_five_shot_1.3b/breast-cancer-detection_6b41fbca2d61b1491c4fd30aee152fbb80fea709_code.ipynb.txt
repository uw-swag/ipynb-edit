```python
    # Load the dataset
    data = load_breast_cancer()
    X = data.data
    y = data.target

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Standardize the features
    sc = StandardScaler()
    X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = sc.transform(X_test)

    # Train the XGBoost classifier
    xgb = XGBClassifier()
    xgb.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    y_pred = xgb.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model
    print("Confusion Matrix: \n", confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
    print("Classification Report: \n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
    print("Accuracy Score: \n", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))

    ```

    This code will load the breast cancer dataset, split it into a training set and a testing set, standardize the features, train an XGBoost classifier, make predictions, and evaluate the model.
