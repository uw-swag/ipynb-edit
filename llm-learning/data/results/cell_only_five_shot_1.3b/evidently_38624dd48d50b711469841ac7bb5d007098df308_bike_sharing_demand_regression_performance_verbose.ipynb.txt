```python
    dashboard = Dashboard(tabs=[RegressionPerformanceTab(verbose_level=1, include_widgets=[
        "Regression Model Performance Report.",
        "Reference: Predicted vs Actual",
        "Current: Predicted vs Actual",
    ])])
    ```

    ## Readme
    ### Dashboard
    #### RegressionPerformanceTab
    ##### verbose_level
    This parameter is used to set the verbose level of the RegressionPerformanceTab. The verbose level is an integer that determines the level of detail in the output. The higher the verbose level, the more detailed the output.

    ##### include_widgets
    This parameter is used to include specific widgets in the RegressionPerformanceTab. The widgets are a list of strings that represent the widgets to be included in the tab.

    ### Usage
    You can use the RegressionPerformanceTab in your Dashboard by specifying the verbose level and the widgets to be included.

    ```python
    dashboard = Dashboard(tabs=[RegressionPerformanceTab(verbose_level=1, include_widgets=[
        "Regression Model Performance Report.",
        "Reference: Predicted vs Actual",
        "Current: Predicted vs Actual",
    ])])
    ```

    This will create a Dashboard with a RegressionPerformanceTab that includes the widgets "Regression Model Performance Report.", "Reference: Predicted vs Actual", and "Current: Predicted vs Actual". The verbose level is set to 1.
