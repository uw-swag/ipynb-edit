The code you've provided is a sequence model in Jupyter notebook. It uses the Deep Java Library (DJL) for machine learning, and it's a simple sequence model. 

The sequence model is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is used for time series prediction. It's a type of model that takes a sequence of data points as input and outputs a single value.

The code includes:

1. A function `plot` that takes in two arrays of data and a label for the x and y axes, and returns a plot of the data.

2. A function `getNet` that returns a simple sequential model with one hidden layer.

3. A function `train` that trains a model on a dataset.

4. A sequence model is trained on a dataset, and the trained model is used to make predictions on a new set of data.

5. The predictions are plotted on top of the original data.

The code also includes a sequence model, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is used for time series prediction. It's a type of model that takes a sequence of data points as input and outputs a single value.
