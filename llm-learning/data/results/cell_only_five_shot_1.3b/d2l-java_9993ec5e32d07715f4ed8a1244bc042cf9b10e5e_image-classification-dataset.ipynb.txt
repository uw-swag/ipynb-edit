The code you provided seems to be correct. It imports the necessary libraries and classes, defines a method to get the dataset, and then uses it to show some images.

However, there are a few things you could consider:

1. Ensure that the `FashionMnist` class is correctly imported and initialized. You might need to check the documentation or source code to make sure it's correctly set up.

2. The `getDataset` method might not be returning the expected results. It's possible that the `FashionMnist` class is not correctly preparing the dataset. You might need to check the documentation or source code to make sure it's correctly set up.

3. The `showImages` method might not be displaying the images correctly. It's possible that the `ImagePanel` and `Container` classes are not correctly defined or implemented. You might need to check the documentation or source code to make sure they're correctly set up.

4. The `getFashionMnistLabel` method might not be returning the expected results. It's possible that the `FashionMnist` class is not correctly setting the labels. You might need to check the documentation or source code to make sure it's correctly set up.

5. The `NDManager` class might not be correctly used. It's possible that the `FashionMnist` class is not correctly using the `NDManager`. You might need to check the documentation or source code to make sure it's correctly set up.

6. The `get` method might not be returning the expected results. It's possible that the `FashionMnist` class is not correctly getting the data. You might need to check the documentation or source code to make sure it's correctly set up.

7. The `squeeze` method might not be working as expected. It's possible that the `FashionMnist` class is not correctly reshaping the data. You might need to check the documentation or source code to make sure it's correctly set up.

8. The `getLabels` method might not be returning the expected results. It's possible that the `FashionMnist` class is not correctly getting the labels. You might need to check the documentation or source code to make sure it's correctly set
