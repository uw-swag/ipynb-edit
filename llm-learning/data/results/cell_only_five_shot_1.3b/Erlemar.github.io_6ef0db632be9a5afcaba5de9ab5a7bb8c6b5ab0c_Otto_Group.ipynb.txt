    ### Response:
    The code you provided is a Python script using the XGBoost library for a multi-class classification problem. Here are some of the changes I made:

    1. I replaced the hardcoded path to the input files with a variable. This makes the code more flexible and easier to maintain.
    2. I used the `LabelEncoder` function from the `sklearn.preprocessing` module to convert the 'target' column into numerical values.
    3. I used the `train_test_split` function from the `sklearn.model_selection` module to split the data into a training set and a test set.
    4. I used the `RandomForestClassifier` and `CalibratedClassifierCV` from the `sklearn.ensemble` module to train a random forest classifier and calibrate its probabilities.
    5. I used the `xgb.DMatrix` function to convert the data into the format required by XGBoost.
    6. I used the `log_loss` function from the `sklearn.metrics` module to calculate the log loss of the model.
    7. I used the `xgb.train` function to train the XGBoost model.
    8. I used the `gbm.predict` function to make predictions on the test set.
    9. I used a weighted average of the predictions from the random forest classifier and the calibrated classifier to get the final predictions.

    Please note that the code is a general guideline and may need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of your project.
