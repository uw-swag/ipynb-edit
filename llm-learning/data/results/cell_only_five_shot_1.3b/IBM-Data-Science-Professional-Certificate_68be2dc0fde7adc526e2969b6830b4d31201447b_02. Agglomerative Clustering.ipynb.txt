    The original code is using the Euclidean distance to calculate the distance between each pair of features in the dataset. However, the Euclidean distance is not the correct metric for clustering. 

    Instead, we should use the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences in the coordinates of the two points. This is a more appropriate metric for clustering because it is less sensitive to the scale of the data.

    Here is the updated code:

    ```python
    import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd
from scipy import ndimage 
from scipy.cluster import hierarchy 
from scipy.spatial import distance_matrix 
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt 
from sklearn import manifold, datasets 
from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering 
from sklearn.datasets.samples_generator import make_blobs 
%matplotlib inline

# read the csv file
filename = 'cars_clus.csv'
pdf = pd.read_csv(filename)

# print the shape of the dataset
print("Shape of dataset: ", pdf.shape)

# print the first 5 rows of the dataset
pdf.head(5)

# calculate the distance matrix
leng = pdf.shape[0]
D = np.zeros([leng,leng])
for i in range(leng):
    for j in range(leng):
        D[i,j] = np.sum(np.abs(pdf.iloc[i] - pdf.iloc[j]))

# perform agglomerative clustering
cluster = AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters=3, affinity='precomputed', linkage='average')
cluster.fit_predict(D)

# print the cluster assignments
print(cluster.labels_)
    ```

    This code will perform agglomerative clustering on the dataset, using 3 clusters. The `affinity` parameter is set to 'precomputed', which means that the distance matrix is precomputed and stored in `D`. The `linkage` parameter is set to 'average', which means that the average of the distances between the members of
