    ### Explanation

    The commit message "#172" includes a condition to check for special characters in the text. This is done by using the `re` module in Python, which allows for regular expressions. The `re.split` function is used to split the text into words, and then a list comprehension is used to check for any special characters. If a special character is found, it is added to a list of special characters. Finally, the list of special characters is returned.

    ### Python Code

    ```python
    import re

    def check_special_chars(text):
        special_chars = re.findall(r'[^\w\s]', text)
        return special_chars
    ```

    ### Jupyter Notebook Code

    The function `check_special_chars` is defined to take a text as input and return a list of any special characters found in the text. The regular expression `[^\w\s]` is used to find any special characters. The `re.findall` function is used to find all occurrences of the regular expression in the text.
