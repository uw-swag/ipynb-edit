```python
    import pandas as pd

    # Load the Oxford Pets dataset
    df = pd.read_csv('data/oxford_pets.csv')

    # Add a credit column to the dataframe
    df['credit'] = 'Credit goes here'

    # Save the updated dataframe to a new csv file
    df.to_csv('data/oxford_pets_with_credit.csv', index=False)
    ```

    Commit Message: "Add credit to oxford pets dataset"
    Original Code Cells:
    '''
    df = pd.read_csv('data/oxford_pets.csv')
    '''
    ]

    ### Response:
    The original code cell is already complete. It reads the Oxford Pets dataset and assigns it to the variable `df`. The credit column is then added to the dataframe and the updated dataframe is saved to a new csv file.

    However, if you want to add a credit column to the existing dataframe, you can use the following code:

    ```python
    # Add a credit column to the dataframe
    df['credit'] = 'Credit goes here'
    ```

    This code will add a new column 'credit' to the dataframe `df` with the value 'Credit goes here'.

    Please replace 'Credit goes here' with the actual credit information you want to add.
