    The function `fit` is a part of the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model, which is a type of artificial neural network. The MLP model is a feedforward artificial neural network with an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.

    The function `fit` is used to train the MLP model. It takes as input the training data `X` and the expected output `y`, as well as the number of iterations to train for, and the learning rate `eta`.

    The function first initializes the weights and biases of the MLP model using the function `init_parameters`.

    Then, it enters a loop that iterates over the number of iterations specified. For each iteration, it performs a forward propagation step, computes the error, and then updates the weights and biases of the MLP model using the backpropagation algorithm.

    The function then returns a list of errors over the iterations, and the learned parameters of the MLP model.

    After training, the function uses the learned parameters to predict the output of the training data, and calculates the accuracy of the predictions.

    The function is then used to train the MLP model on the XOR problem, and it prints the accuracy of the predictions.

    The function `fit` is a crucial part of the MLP model, as it is the core of the training process.
