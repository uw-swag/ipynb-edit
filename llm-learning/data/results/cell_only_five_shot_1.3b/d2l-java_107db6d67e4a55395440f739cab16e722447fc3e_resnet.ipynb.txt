```python
    # Move utils into its own subpackage, split into generic and material utilities
    # Create a new subpackage 'utils'
    # Move the plot-utils.ipynb into the 'utils' subpackage

    # Then, in your main code, import the utils package
    %load ../utils/plot-utils.ipynb
    from utils import plot_utils

    # Now, you can use the plot_utils in your main code
    plot_utils.plot_function()
    ```

    ### Explanation:
    The code provided is a function for training a model in a chapter 6 of a book. The function takes several parameters including the training and test datasets, the number of epochs, and the trainer. The function then trains the model, calculates the metrics, and prints the results.

    The code is refactored to move the utilities into a subpackage, which is a good practice for organizing code. The 'utils' subpackage is created, and the 'plot-utils.ipynb' file is moved into this subpackage.

    In the main code, the utils package is imported, and the plot_utils object is created from it. This allows the plot_utils functions to be used in the main code.

    Please note that the actual implementation of the plot_utils functions will depend on the specific requirements of the plotting functionality.
