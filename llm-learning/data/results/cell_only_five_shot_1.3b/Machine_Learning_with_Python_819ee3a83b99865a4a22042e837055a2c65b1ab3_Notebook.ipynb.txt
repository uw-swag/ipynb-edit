```python
    from sklearn import datasets
    from sklearn import svm
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn import metrics

    # Load iris dataset
    iris = datasets.load_iris()

    # Split dataset into training set and test set
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris.data, iris.target, test_size=0.3,random_state=109) # 70% training and 30% test

    # Create a SVM Classifier
    clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear') # Linear Kernel

    # Train the model using the training sets
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Predict the response for test dataset
    y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

    # Model Accuracy
    print("Accuracy:",metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
    ```
    This code will train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification on the iris dataset. The accuracy of the model is printed at the end.
