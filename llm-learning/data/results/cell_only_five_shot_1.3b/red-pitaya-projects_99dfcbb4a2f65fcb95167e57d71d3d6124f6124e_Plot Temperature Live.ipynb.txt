```python
    import os
    import shutil

    # Get the list of all notebooks in the current directory
    notebooks = [f for f in os.listdir('.') if f.endswith('.ipynb')]

    # Create a folder for each notebook
    for notebook in notebooks:
        folder_name = notebook.split('.')[0]
        if not os.path.exists(folder_name):
            os.makedirs(folder_name)

        # Move the notebook to its corresponding folder
        shutil.move(notebook, folder_name)
    ```

    This script will move all .ipynb files in the current directory to folders named after the files. The folders will be created if they do not already exist.
