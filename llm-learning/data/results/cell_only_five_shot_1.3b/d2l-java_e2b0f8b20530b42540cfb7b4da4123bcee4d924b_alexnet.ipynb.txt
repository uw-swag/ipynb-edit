    The code you provided is a simple implementation of AlexNet and VGG networks using the Deep Learning library DJL (Deep Java Library). 

    AlexNet is a convolutional neural network architecture that was proposed by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton. It was used to win the ImageNet competition in 2012.

    VGG, on the other hand, is a family of convolutional neural networks architecture that was proposed by Kaiming He, Rebecca F. Elshenich, and Ian J. Goodfellow. It was used to win the ILSVRC competition in 2014.

    The code provided is a basic implementation of these networks. It uses the Deep Java Library (DJL) to train a model on the Fashion-MNIST dataset, a dataset of Zalando's article images. The model is trained to recognize the 10 classes of clothing.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the DJL library to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The model is built using a SequentialBlock, which is a linear stack of layers. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer, and the loss function is the softmax cross entropy loss.

    The model is trained for 20 epochs, and the accuracy of the model is printed out after each epoch.

    Please note that the code provided is a basic implementation and may not work perfectly for all types of data or tasks. It is recommended to use a more advanced library like TensorFlow or PyTorch for more complex tasks.
