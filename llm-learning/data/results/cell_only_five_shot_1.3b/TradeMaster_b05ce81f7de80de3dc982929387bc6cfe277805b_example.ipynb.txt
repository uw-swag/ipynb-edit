```python
    # Importing necessary libraries
    from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Assuming you have a DataFrame 'df' with stock prices
    df = pd.read_csv('stock_prices.csv')

    # Preprocessing the data
    df = df.dropna()

    # Selecting features
    features = df[['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Volume']]

    # Creating a KMeans model
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)

    # Fitting the model
    kmeans.fit(features)

    # Adding a new column 'Cluster' to the DataFrame
    df['Cluster'] = kmeans.labels_

    # Plotting the clusters
    plt.scatter(df['Open'], df['Volume'], c=df['Cluster'])
    plt.show()
    ```

    This code will create a scatter plot of the stock prices, with the different clusters represented by different colors. The KMeans algorithm is used to group the stock prices into three clusters.
