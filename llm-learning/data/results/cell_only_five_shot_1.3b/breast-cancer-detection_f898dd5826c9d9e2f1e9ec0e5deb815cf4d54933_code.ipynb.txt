```python
    # Load the breast cancer dataset
    data = load_breast_cancer()

    # Convert the dataset into a pandas dataframe
    df = pd.DataFrame(data.data, columns=data.feature_names)
    df['target'] = data.target

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df[data.feature_names], df['target'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Standardize the features
    sc = StandardScaler()
    X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = sc.transform(X_test)

    # Implementing Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier
    gnb = GaussianNB()
    gnb.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Making predictions
    y_pred = gnb.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluating the model performance
    print("Confusion Matrix: \n", confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
    print("Classification Report: \n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
    print("Accuracy Score: \n", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
    ```
    This code will load the breast cancer dataset, split it into training and testing sets, standardize the features, and implement the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier. It will then make predictions, evaluate the model performance, and print out the confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score.
