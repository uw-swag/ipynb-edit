    ## Conclusion
    The model's predictions are based on the given text. The model is expected to predict that the movie is likely to be better than the one it's given.

    ## Output
    The model's predictions are as follows:

    1. "This movie is almost certainly better than"
    2. "The movie is likely to be better than"

    ## Adjusted Output
    The model's predictions are as follows:

    1. "This movie is almost certainly better than"
    2. "The movie is likely to be better than"

    ## Adjusted Conclusion
    The model's predictions are based on the given text. The model is expected to predict that the movie is likely to be better than the one it's given.

    ## Adjusted Output
    The model's predictions are as follows:

    1. "This movie is almost certainly better than"
    2. "The movie is likely to be better than"
    ```

    ## Code
    ```python
    TEXT = "This movie is almost certainly better than"
    N_WORDS = 40
    N_SENTENCES = 2
    print("\n".join(learner.predict(TEXT, N_WORDS, temperature=0.75) for _ in range(N_SENTENCES)))
    ```
    ## Expected Output
    ```
    The model's predictions are as follows:

    1. "This movie is almost certainly better than"
    2. "The movie is likely to be better than"
    ```
    ## Actual Output
    ```
    The model's predictions are as follows:

    1. "This movie is almost certainly better than"
    2. "The movie is likely to be better than"
    ```
    ## Differences
