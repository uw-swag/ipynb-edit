    The first part of the section is about the use of the `.get_params()` method in the pipeline. This method is used to get the parameters of the transformer or estimator that is part of the pipeline.

    The second part of the section is about the use of the `DiversityEvaluator` class. This class is used to evaluate the diversity of a recommendation system. The diversity of a recommendation system is a measure of how well the system recommends items that are not in the user's top recommendations.

    The `DiversityEvaluator` class has several methods that can be used to evaluate the diversity of a recommendation system. These methods include:

    - `catalog_coverage`: This method calculates the percentage of items that are in the catalog of the recommendation system.
    - `distributional_coverage`: This method calculates the percentage of items that are distributed among the users.
    - `novelty`: This method calculates the novelty of a user. The novelty of a user is the difference between the average rating of the user and the average rating of the items that the user has rated.
    - `diversity`: This method calculates the diversity of a user. The diversity of a user is the difference between the average rating of the user and the average rating of the items that the user has rated.
    - `serendipity`: This method calculates the serendipity of a user. The serendipity of a user is the difference between the average rating of the user and the average rating of the items that the user has rated.

    The `DiversityEvaluator` class also has a `__init__` method that is used to initialize the `DiversityEvaluator` object. This method takes the following parameters:

    - `train_df`: This is a pandas DataFrame that contains the training data.
    - `reco_df`: This is a pandas DataFrame that contains the recommendations made by the recommendation system.
    - `user_col`: This is the name of the column in the `train_df` DataFrame that contains the user identifiers.
    - `item_col`: This is the name of the column in the `train_df` DataFrame that contains the item
