    The code you provided seems to be a part of a larger codebase, and it seems to be missing some necessary imports or functions. 

    Here are some potential issues and fixes:

    1. The code is missing the necessary imports for the functions and classes you are using. You need to import the following:

        - `build_net` from `trademaster.nets.builder`
        - `build_environment` from `trademaster.environments.builder`
        - `build_dataset` from `trademaster.datasets.builder`
        - `build_agent` from `trademaster.agents.builder`
        - `build_optimizer` from `trademaster.optimizers.builder`
        - `build_loss` from `trademaster.losses.builder`
        - `build_trainer` from `trademaster.trainers.builder`
        - `build_transition` from `trademaster.transition.builder`

    2. The code is missing the necessary imports for the classes you are using. You need to import the following:

        - `Config` from `mmcv`
        - `replace_cfg_vals` from `trademaster.utils`

    3. The code is missing the necessary imports for the functions you are using. You need to import the following:

        - `parse_args` from `argparse`
        - `osp` from `os.path`

    4. The code is missing the necessary imports for the classes you are using. You need to import the following:

        - `Counter` from `collections`

    5. The code is missing the necessary imports for the functions you are using. You need to import the following:

        - `torch.device` from `torch`
        - `torch.cuda.is_available` from `torch`

    6. The code is missing the necessary imports for the classes you are using. You need to import the following:

        - `train_environment` from `trademaster.environments.builder`
        - `valid_environment` from `trademaster.environments.builder`
        - `test_environment` from `
