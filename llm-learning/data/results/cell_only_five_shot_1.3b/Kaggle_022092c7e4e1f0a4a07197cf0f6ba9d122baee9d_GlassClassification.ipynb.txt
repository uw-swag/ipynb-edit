    The Box-Cox transformation is a method of transforming a variable to reduce skewness and/or kurtosis. It's often used to make data more normally distributed.

    The function `boxcox()` from the `scipy.stats` module is used to perform the Box-Cox transformation. The first element of the output is the transformed data, and the second element is the p-value. If the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis that the data is normally distributed.

    The `boxcox()` function is used to transform the data, and the result is a tuple of two elements. The first element is the transformed data, and the second element is the p-value. The p-value is a measure of the significance of the transformation. If the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis that the data is normally distributed.
