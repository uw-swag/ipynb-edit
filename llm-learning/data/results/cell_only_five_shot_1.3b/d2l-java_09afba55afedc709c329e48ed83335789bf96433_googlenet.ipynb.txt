    This code is a part of a larger project that involves machine learning and deep learning. The code is using the Deep Java Library (DJL) for deep learning. The code is also using the Tablesaw library for data manipulation and visualization.

    The code is setting up a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for image classification. The CNN is composed of several layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The model is trained using the training data and the loss function is set to softmax cross entropy loss.

    The code also includes a function `inceptionBlock` that creates a block of layers for an inception block. The inception block is a building block for the CNN, and it consists of several paths through the network.

    The code also includes a loop to train the model on the training data, and it also includes a loop to evaluate the model on the test data. The training and test data are loaded from the FashionMnist dataset, which is a dataset of Zalando's article images.

    The code also includes a loop to render a line plot of the training and test loss and accuracy over the epochs. The line plot is used to visualize the training process.

    The code is written in Java, and it uses the DJL and Tablesaw libraries.

    The code is a good example of how to use the DJL library for deep learning in Java. It also shows how to use the Tablesaw library for data manipulation and visualization.
