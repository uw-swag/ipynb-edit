    # Perceptron Limitations and Conclusions

    # Perceptrons are a type of artificial neural network that is used for binary classification problems.
    # They are simple yet powerful tools for understanding the underlying patterns in data.

    # Limitations:
    # 1. They are not capable of learning from complex patterns.
    # 2. They are not suitable for problems with large datasets.
    # 3. They are not suitable for problems with high-dimensional data.

    # Conclusions:
    # 1. Perceptrons are a useful tool for understanding the underlying patterns in data.
    # 2. However, they may not be the best choice for problems with large datasets or high-dimensional data.
    # 3. For these types of problems, other machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM),
    #    Random Forests, or Neural Networks may be more appropriate.

    # Decision Tree Limitations and Conclusions

    # Decision Trees are a type of supervised learning algorithm that is used for classification and regression tasks.
    # They are a tree-like model of decisions and are used for both classification and regression tasks.

    # Limitations:
    # 1. They are not suitable for problems with large datasets.
    # 2. They are not capable of handling missing values.
    # 3. They are not suitable for problems with high-dimensional data.

    # Conclusions:
    # 1. Decision Trees are a powerful tool for understanding the underlying patterns in data.
    # 2. However, they may not be the best choice for problems with large datasets or high-dimensional data.
