    The code you've provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses Python's pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn libraries to perform various data analysis and machine learning tasks. 

    The notebook begins with loading a dataset from a CSV file, and then it uses various methods to filter the data, such as selecting only numerical columns, checking for constant columns, and selecting the best features based on mutual information or chi-square test. 

    It also uses a decision tree regressor to predict the target variable for a subset of the features, and calculates the mean squared error for each feature. 

    The notebook then uses a decision tree classifier to predict the target variable for a subset of the features, and calculates the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) for each feature. 

    Finally, it sorts the features based on their performance metrics and prints the number of features that are kept. 

    The code is a good example of how to use these techniques to filter and select the best features for a machine learning model.
