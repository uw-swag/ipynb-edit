    print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')

    # Rerun the notebook
    # You need to have a proper environment to run the notebook
    # You can use the command `jupyter notebook` in your terminal to open the notebook in a new tab
    # Or you can use the command `jupyter lab` to open the notebook in a new window
    # After running the notebook, you can make changes and rerun it as needed
