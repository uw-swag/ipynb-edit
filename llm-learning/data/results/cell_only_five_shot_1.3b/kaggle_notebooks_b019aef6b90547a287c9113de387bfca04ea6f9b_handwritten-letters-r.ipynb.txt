The code you've provided is a series of Jupyter notebook cells, each of which is a script for a specific task. Here's a brief explanation of what each cell does:

1. The first cell imports necessary libraries and modules. It's a good practice to import all necessary libraries at the beginning of your script to avoid any potential errors.

2. The second cell displays a style for the Jupyter notebook. This is used to style the notebook and make it look more attractive.

3. The third cell loads the image data. It reads the CSV files containing the image paths and labels, and then loads the images using the `image_load` function.

4. The fourth cell reshapes the image data into a format that can be used by the model.

5. The fifth cell displays the first few rows of the data.

6. The sixth cell defines the model architecture. It creates a sequential model with three convolutional layers, followed by a few dense layers, and finally a softmax layer.

7. The seventh cell compiles the model. It sets the loss function to be categorical cross-entropy, the optimizer to be Adam, and the metrics to be accuracy.

8. The eighth cell defines callbacks for the model. It saves the best model weights and reduces the learning rate when the validation loss stops improving.

9. The ninth cell trains the model. It fits the model to the training data, validating on the validation data, and then evaluates the model on the test data.

10. The tenth cell displays the performance of the model on the test data.

11. The eleventh cell loads the best model weights and evaluates the model on the test data.

12. The twelfth cell displays the performance of the CNN model on the test data.

13. The thirteenth cell displays the performance of the MLP model on the test data.

14. The fourteenth cell displays the performance of the CNN model on the test data.

15. The fifteenth cell displays the performance of the MLP model on the test data.

16. The sixteenth cell displays the performance of the CNN model on the test data.

17. The seventeenth cell displays the performance of the MLP
