    The code you've provided is a Python script that uses the K-means clustering algorithm to group data points. The script first loads the data, then it computes the centroids of the data points, and finally, it uses the centroids to group the data points.

    The script also includes a function to initialize centroids randomly, and a function to change the centroids based on the mean of the data points in each cluster.

    The script also includes a class to run the K-means algorithm, and a function to use random centroids.

    The script also includes a function to visualize the data points and the centroids.

    The script also includes a function to visualize the data points and the centroids after running the K-means algorithm.

    The script also includes a function to visualize the data points and the centroids after using random centroids.

    The script also includes a function to visualize the data points and the centroids after using the K-means algorithm.

    The script also includes a function to visualize the data points and the centroids after using the K-means algorithm with random centroids.
