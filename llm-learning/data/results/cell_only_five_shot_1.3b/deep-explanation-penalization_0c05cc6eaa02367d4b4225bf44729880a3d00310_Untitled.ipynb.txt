    The code you provided is a combination of image processing and segmentation tasks. In this case, the dilation operation is used to penalize the segmentation process. The dilation operation increases the size of the boundaries of the foreground objects, which in turn increases the size of the background objects. This is a common technique used in image segmentation to penalize the segmentation of the background objects.

    Here is the modified code with the dilation operation:

    ```python
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from skimage.filters import canny
    from skimage.segmentation import probabilistic_hough_line
    from skimage.color import rgb2gray

    fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=len(imgs), ncols=3, figsize=(40, 30))
    for i in range(len(imgs)):
        test = imgs[i]
        axes[i, 0].imshow(test)
        bw_img = rgb2gray(test)
        edges = canny(bw_img)

        axes[i, 1].imshow(edges)

        lines = probabilistic_hough_line(edges, threshold=40, line_length=200, line_gap=10)
        axes[i, 2].imshow(edges * 0)

        for line in lines:
            p0, p1 = line
            axes[i, 2].plot((p0[0], p1[0]), (p0[1], p1[1]))

        # Dilate the image to increase the size of the foreground objects
        dilated_edges = cv2.dilate(edges, None, iterations=1)
        axes[i, 2].imshow(dilated_edges, cmap='gray')

    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.savefig("Tee")
    plt.show()
    ```

    In this code, the `cv2.dilate` function is used to dilate the edges image.
