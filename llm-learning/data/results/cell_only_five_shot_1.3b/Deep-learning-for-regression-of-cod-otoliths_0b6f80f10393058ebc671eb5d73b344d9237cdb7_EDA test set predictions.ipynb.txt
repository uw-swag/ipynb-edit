    The code you've provided is a Jupyter notebook that includes several cells. Each cell is a piece of code that performs a specific task. The code is written in Python and uses several libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

    Here's a brief explanation of what each cell does:

    1. The first cell is a comment that explains what the notebook is about.

    2. The second cell imports the necessary libraries.

    3. The third cell defines some global variables.

    4. The fourth cell reads the data.

    5. The fifth cell performs some basic EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on the data.

    6. The sixth cell defines a function that calculates the harmonic mean of a list of numbers.

    7. The seventh cell calculates the harmonic mean of the 'age' column in the data.

    8. The eighth cell calculates the harmonic mean of the 'age' column in the data, but this time with a different threshold.

    9. The ninth cell calculates the harmonic mean of the 'age' column in the data, but this time with a different threshold.

    10. The tenth cell calculates the harmonic mean of the 'age' column in the data, but this time with a different threshold.

    11. The eleventh cell calculates the harmonic mean of the 'age' column in the data, but this time with a different threshold.

    12. The twelfth cell calculates the harmonic mean of the 'age' column in the data, but this time with a different threshold.

    13. The thirteenth cell calculates the harmonic mean of the 'age' column in the data, but this time with a different threshold.

    14. The fourteenth cell calculates the harmonic mean of the 'age' column in the data, but this time with a different threshold.

    15. The fifteenth cell calculates the harmonic mean of the 'age' column in the data, but this time with a different threshold.

    16. The sixteenth cell calculates the harmonic mean of the 'age' column in the data, but this time with a different threshold.

    17. The
