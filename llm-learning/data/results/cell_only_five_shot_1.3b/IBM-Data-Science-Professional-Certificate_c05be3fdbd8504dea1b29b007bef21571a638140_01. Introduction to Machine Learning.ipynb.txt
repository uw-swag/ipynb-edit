    ## 01. Introduction to Machine Learning

    Machine learning is a key component of data science, and it's a powerful tool that can help businesses make more informed decisions. This notebook will introduce you to the basics of machine learning, including the types of problems that can be solved with machine learning, the different types of machine learning algorithms, and how to implement them.

    ### 1. Types of Machine Learning

    There are several types of machine learning:

    - **Supervised Learning:** This is the most common type of machine learning. The model is trained on a labeled dataset. The goal is to learn a function that maps inputs to outputs.

    - **Unsupervised Learning:** This type of machine learning is used when the model is not given any labels. The goal is to find patterns in the data.

    - **Reinforcement Learning:** This is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some type of reward.

    - **Semi-Supervised Learning:** This type of machine learning is used when the model is partially trained on labeled data. The goal is to learn a function that can generalize from the data.

    - **Transfer Learning:** This is a type of machine learning where a pre-trained model is used as a starting point for a new task.

    ### 2. Types of Algorithms

    There are several types of algorithms used in machine learning:

    - **Supervised Learning Algorithms:** These include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, SVM, KNN, and neural networks.

    - **Unsupervised Learning Algorithms:** These include k-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, and principal component analysis.

    - **Reinforcement Learning Algorithms:** These include Q-learning, Deep Q Network (DQN), and Policy Gradient methods.

    - **Semi-Supervised Learning Algorithms:** These include autoencoders, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and generative adversarial networks (GANs).

    - **Transfer Learning Algorithms:** These include VGG16, ResNet, and Inception.
