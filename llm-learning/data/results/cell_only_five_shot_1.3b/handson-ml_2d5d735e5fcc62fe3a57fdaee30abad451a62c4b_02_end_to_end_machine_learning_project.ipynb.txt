```python
    # Crop long outputs to make it easier to visualize the notebooks on github.com
    import os
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Get all files in the current directory
    files = os.listdir()

    # Loop through each file
    for file in files:
        # If the file is a python file
        if file.endswith(".py"):
            # Open the file
            with open(file, "r") as f:
                lines = f.readlines()

            # If the file is too long
            if len(lines) > 100:
                # Crop the lines to 100
                lines = lines[:100]

                # Write the new lines back to the file
                with open(file, "w") as f:
                    f.write("".join(lines))

    # Show a message
    print("Cropped long outputs to 100 lines.")
    ```
    This script will crop the first 100 lines of each python file in the current directory. This is a simple way to keep the notebooks on github.com clean and easy to read.
