    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook that uses PySpark to process and analyze a dataset from the UniProt database. The dataset is then stored in a pandas DataFrame and visualized using matplotlib.

    The code includes the following steps:

    1. Importing necessary libraries and modules.
    2. Loading the UniProt dataset.
    3. Processing the dataset and storing it in a pandas DataFrame.
    4. Checking if the weights of the two models are equivalent.
    5. Plotting the results.

    The code is annotated to provide a brief explanation of each step.

    Please note that the code is written in Python and uses the PySpark library for data processing, pandas for data manipulation, and matplotlib for data visualization.
