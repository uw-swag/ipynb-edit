The code you provided is a Python script that uses the evidently library to analyze the performance of a machine learning model. The script is using different types of metrics to evaluate the performance of a model, such as the dataset-level metrics, column-level metrics, and options.

The latest metrics in the evidently library are:

1. `DataDriftMetric`: This metric calculates the statistical dependence between the two datasets.

2. `DataDriftTable`: This metric provides a table with the statistical dependence between the two datasets.

3. `DatasetDriftMetric`: This metric calculates the statistical dependence between the two datasets.

4. `ColumnDriftMetric`: This metric calculates the statistical dependence between the two datasets for a specific column.

5. `ColumnRegExpMetric`: This metric checks if the value of a specific column matches a regular expression.

6. `DataDriftOptions`: This class provides options for statistical tests. The latest option is `all_features_stattest='psi'`, which stands for the Performancedistance Index Test.

The code you provided is a good example of how to use these metrics and options. It demonstrates how to run a report with different metrics and options, and how to use the `run` method of the `Report` class.

However, it's important to note that the latest metrics and options in the evidently library may not be available in all versions of the library. Always check the documentation of the library to ensure you're using the latest version.
