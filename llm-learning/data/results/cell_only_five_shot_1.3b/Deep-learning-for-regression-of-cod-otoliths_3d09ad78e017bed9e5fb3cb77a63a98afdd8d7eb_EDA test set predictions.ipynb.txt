    The code you provided is a Python script that uses the scikit-learn library to calculate the accuracy and mean squared error of a model on a set of test sets. The test sets are read from CSV files, and the accuracy and mean squared error of each test set are calculated.

    The script also calculates the aggregate accuracy and mean squared error of all the test sets.

    The code is divided into three parts:

    1. The first part reads the test sets from CSV files and calculates the accuracy and mean squared error of each test set.

    2. The second part calculates the aggregate accuracy and mean squared error of all the test sets.

    3. The last part calculates the final accuracy and mean squared error of the aggregate model.

    The final accuracy and mean squared error of the aggregate model is printed to the console.

    Please note that the code assumes that the test sets are stored in CSV files with the names "test_set_0.csv", "test_set_1.csv", etc., and that the CSV files contain a column named "y_pred_test_rounded" and a column named "y_true" for the predicted and true values, respectively.

    Also, the code uses the pandas library to read the CSV files and the scikit-learn library to calculate the accuracy and mean squared error.

    The code is a simple example and may need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of your project.
