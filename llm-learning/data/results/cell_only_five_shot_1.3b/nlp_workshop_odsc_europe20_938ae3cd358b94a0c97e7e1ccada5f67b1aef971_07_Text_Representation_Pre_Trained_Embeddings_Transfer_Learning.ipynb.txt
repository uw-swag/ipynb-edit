    ## Text Representation Learning

    Text representation learning is the process of converting text into a form that can be used for further processing. This is often done by converting the text into a numerical form, which can then be used for further processing.

    There are several types of text representation learning, including:

    1. **Word Embeddings**: This is a type of text representation where each word in the text is represented as a vector in a high-dimensional space. The vectors are learned from the text data.

    2. **Character Embeddings**: In this method, each character in the text is represented as a vector. The vectors are learned from the text data.

    3. **Transformer-based Models**: These models use a type of architecture called the Transformer, which is a type of model that uses self-attention mechanisms. The text is transformed into a form that can be processed by the model.

    ## Example: Word Embeddings

    Let's consider a simple example of word embeddings. We will use the GloVe word embeddings, which are pre-trained on a large corpus of text.

    ```python
    from gensim.models import KeyedVectors

    # Load the GloVe word embeddings
    glove_vectors = KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format('glove.6B.100d.txt.w2v', binary=False)

    # Get the vector for a word
    word = 'computer'
    vector = glove_vectors[word]

    # Print the vector
    print(vector)
    ```

    ## Example: Transformer-based Models

    Let's consider a simple example of a transformer-based model. We will use the Transformer model from the Transformers library in PyTorch.

    ```python
    from transformers import TransformerModel, AutoTokenizer

    # Initialize the tokenizer
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

    # Initialize the model
    model = TransformerModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

    # Tokenize the text
    inputs =
