    from learntools.core import binder; binder.bind(globals())

    Original Code Cells:

    '''
    ]

    ### Response:
    The code provided is already complete. It sets up the environment for the Python exercises. The `binder.bind(globals())` line binds the global namespace to the binder, which allows the exercises to be accessed from any cell in the notebook. The `from learntools.python.ex7 import *` line imports all the functions and classes defined in the `ex7` module. The `print('Setup complete.')` line prints a message to indicate that the setup is complete.

    However, if you want to add a new exercise, you can do so by creating a new Python file in the `exercises` directory. The file should contain a function that defines the exercise. The function should be named after the exercise, and it should be decorated with `@check_qa`. The function should take no arguments and return a tuple of two elements: the exercise's title and the function that implements the exercise.

    For example, if you want to add an exercise that calculates the sum of two numbers, you could define the function like this:

    ```python
    from learntools.python.ex7 import *

    def ex_sum():
        def f(a, b):
            return a + b
        return 'Sum', f
    ```

    Then, you can add the exercise to the list in the `exercises` module's code.
