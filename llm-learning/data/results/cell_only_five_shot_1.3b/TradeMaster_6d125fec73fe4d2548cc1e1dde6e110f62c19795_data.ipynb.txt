    Here is the updated code. I have made the following changes:

    1. I have updated the competition code to use the correct file path for the data.
    2. I have added the necessary import statements.
    3. I have updated the code to read the data correctly.
    4. I have added the necessary code to preprocess the data.
    5. I have updated the code to use the correct file path for the test data.
    6. I have added the necessary code to preprocess the test data.
    7. I have updated the code to use the correct file path for the output file.
    8. I have added the necessary code to generate the output file.

    Please note that the updated code assumes that the competition data and test data are in the same format and that the output file is in the same format. If these assumptions are not true, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.
