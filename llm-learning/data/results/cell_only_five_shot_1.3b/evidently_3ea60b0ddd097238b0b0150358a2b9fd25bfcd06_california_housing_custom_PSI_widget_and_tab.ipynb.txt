    The code you provided is a part of a larger process that involves data analysis, model training, and visualization. Here's a brief explanation of what each part of the code does:

    1. **Data loading and preprocessing**: The code imports the California housing dataset from sklearn, and preprocesses the data by scaling numerical features.

    2. **Model training**: The code trains a RandomForestRegressor model on the reference data.

    3. **Model evaluation**: The code calculates the Population Stability Index (PSI) for each feature in the reference data, and compares the predicted values from the model with the actual values.

    4. **Dashboard creation**: The code creates a dashboard that displays the regression performance of the model. The dashboard includes widgets that display the PSI for each feature, the predicted vs actual graph, and the error distribution.

    5. **Widget creation**: The code creates a custom widget that calculates the PSI for a specific feature. This widget is included in the dashboard, and can be used to compare the performance of the model for different features.

    6. **Dashboard sharing**: The code saves the dashboard to an HTML file, which can be shared with colleagues and friends.

    The code is a good example of how to use the evidently library to create a custom dashboard and widget.
