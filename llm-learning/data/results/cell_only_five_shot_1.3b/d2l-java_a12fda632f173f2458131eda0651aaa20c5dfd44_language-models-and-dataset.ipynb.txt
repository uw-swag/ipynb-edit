    This code is used to add the necessary Maven dependencies for the AI/ML libraries used in the code. The dependencies are:

    1. ai.djl:api:0.10.0: This is the main API for the Deep Java Library (DJL), which is a machine learning library for deep learning models.

    2. org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.26: This is the API for the Simple Logging Facade (SLF4J), which is a facade for Java logging framework.

    3. org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:1.7.26: This is the Simple Logging Facade (SLF4J) implementation, which is a facade for Java logging framework.

    4. ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-engine:0.10.0: This is the engine for the MXNet, a deep learning framework that uses the computation graph for efficient model training.

    5. ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-native-auto:1.7.0-backport: This is the native-auto build for MXNet, a deep learning framework that uses the computation graph for efficient model training.

    These dependencies are used to ensure that the code can run successfully, as they provide the necessary dependencies for the code to function correctly.
