    # Exercise 3: Accessing elements in a 2D array using slicing

    # Exercise 6: Accessing elements in a 2D array using advanced indexing with boolean conditions

    # Exercise 7: Accessing elements in a 2D array using advanced indexing with advanced boolean conditions

    # Exercise 8: Accessing elements in a 2D array using advanced indexing with advanced boolean conditions
