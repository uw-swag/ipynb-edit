    The TensorFlow example you provided is a simple script that uses TensorFlow to load a TensorFlow Lite model and run inference on it. 

    However, it seems like you want to remove this example from the master branch. This is not a recommended action as it could lead to confusion and potential issues. 

    If you want to remove this example, you should first ensure that you have a backup of the original code. Then, you can delete the code from your master branch. 

    Here's how you can do it:

    1. First, you need to clone the repository to your local machine.
    2. Navigate to the repository directory.
    3. Checkout to the master branch.
    4. Delete the TensorFlow example code.

    After you've done this, you can push your changes to the master branch.

    Please note that this is a destructive operation and it will permanently remove the code from your master branch.
