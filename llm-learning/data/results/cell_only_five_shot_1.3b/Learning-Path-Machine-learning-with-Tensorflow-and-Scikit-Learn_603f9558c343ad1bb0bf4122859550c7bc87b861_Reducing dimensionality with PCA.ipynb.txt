```python
    # Importing data
    dataframe = read(1)
    #print(dataframe)
    # Delete incorrect Data

    cleaned_data = zeroDet(dataframe, 0)

    #Check how balanced data is
    counts = count_labels(cleaned_data)
    print("Instances of every label, starting by one to seven",counts) 

    #Feature Extraction
    grouped_data = grouping(cleaned_data)
    features = extract_features(grouped_data)

    print(np.histogram(features.__getitem__(1),7))

    #we are calling the function for classify our data, first with a simple
    #splitting of the dataset to divide test and training set, after
    #using k-crossvalidation with two different train model: 1)RandomForest classifier , 2)Super Vector Machine
    classify(features.__getitem__(0),features.__getitem__(1))
    #CrossValidation(features.__getitem__(0),features.__getitem__(1), 5)
    ```
    This code block is for adding the code files related to the module 03. It includes importing data, zero-detection of incorrect data, checking the balance of the data, feature extraction, classification using RandomForest and SVM, and cross-validation.
