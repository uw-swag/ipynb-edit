    # define X and y
    X = df.drop('type', axis=1)
    y = df['type']

    # instantiate a DecisionTreeRegressor (with random_state=1)
    dt = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=1)

    # use leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) to estimate the RMSE for this model
    scores = cross_val_score(dt, X, y, cv=LOOCV)
    print("RMSE: %f" % np.sqrt(np.mean(scores)))

    # read the testing data
    X_test = pd.read_csv('test.csv')

    # use fitted model to make predictions on testing data
    y_pred = dt.predict(X_test)

    # calculate RMSE
    rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))

    # calculate RMSE for your own tree!
    # you can replace the code above with your own tree model
    # and calculate the RMSE as above
