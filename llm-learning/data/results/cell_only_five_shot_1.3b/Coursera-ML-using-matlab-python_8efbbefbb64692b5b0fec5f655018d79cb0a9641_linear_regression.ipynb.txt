    The code you provided is a Python script that uses numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn to load data, visualize the data, and perform linear regression on it. The script also includes a function to compute the cost and gradient descent, and a function to predict the output.

    The script is divided into several sections:

    1. Data loading and visualization: The script loads a dataset from a file, prints the shape of the data, and plots it.

    2. Compute cost and gradient descent: The script computes the cost and gradient descent for a given set of theta values.

    3. Prediction: The script predicts the output for a new set of theta values.

    4. Plotting: The script plots the cost function and the contour plot of the cost function.

    5. Optimization: The script optimizes the theta values using gradient descent.

    The script also includes a section to test the correctness of the code.

    Please note that the script assumes that the data file 'ex1data1.txt' is in the same directory as the script. If the file is located elsewhere, you will need to provide the full path to the file.

    Also, the script uses a linear model for the prediction. If you want to use a different model, you will need to modify the prediction function accordingly.

    Finally, the script uses a linear model for the cost function. If you want to use a different cost function, you will need to modify the compute_cost function accordingly.
