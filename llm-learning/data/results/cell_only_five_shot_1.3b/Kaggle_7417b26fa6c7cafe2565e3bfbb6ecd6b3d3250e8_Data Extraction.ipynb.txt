```python
    import gspread
    from oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentials

    # use creds to create a client to interact with the Google Drive API
    scope = ['https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds',
             'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive']
    creds = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name('client_secret.json', scope)
    client = gspread.authorize(creds)

    # Find a workbook by name and open the first sheet
    # Make sure you use the right name here.
    sheet = client.open("Test_Sheet").sheet1

    # Extract and print all of the values
    list_of_hashes = sheet.get_all_records()
    print(list_of_hashes)
    ```
    This code will extract data from a Google Sheets document and print it out. You'll need to replace "Test_Sheet" with the name of your Google Sheets document.

    Also, you'll need to replace 'client_secret.json' with the path to your own JSON file that contains your Google API credentials.

    This code uses the gspread and oauth2client libraries. If you don't have these installed, you can do so with pip:

    ```
    pip install gspread oauth2client
    ```

    Note: This code will only work if you have the appropriate permissions to access the Google Sheets document.
