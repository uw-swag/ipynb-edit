    # Warning: Duplicated columns in the data drift report.
    # This warning is triggered when the same column is present in the data
    # set and the report. This can be due to a discrepancy in the data
    # source or the data processing steps.

    # Check for duplicated columns in the data set
    duplicated_columns = [col for col in df.columns if df[col].nunique() == 1]

    # If there are duplicated columns, remove them from the data set
    if duplicated_columns:
        df = df.drop(duplicated_columns, axis=1)
    ```
