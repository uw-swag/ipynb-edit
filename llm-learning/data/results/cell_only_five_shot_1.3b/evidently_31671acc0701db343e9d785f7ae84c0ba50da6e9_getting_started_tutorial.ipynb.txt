```python
    import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing

from evidently import ColumnMapping

from evidently.report import Report
from evidently.metric_preset import DataDrift, NumTargetDrift

from evidently.test_suite import TestSuite
from evidently.test_preset import DataQuality, DataStability
from evidently.tests import *

# Define the column mapping
column_mapping = ColumnMapping()
column_mapping.add_dataset_column("households", "households")
column_mapping.add_dataset_column("median_income", "median_income")

# Create a report
drift_report = Report(metrics=[DataDrift(), NumTargetDrift()], column_mapping=column_mapping)

# Fetch the data
reference = fetch_california_housing()
current = fetch_california_housing()

# Run the report
drift_report.run(reference_data=reference, current_data=current)

# Print the report
print(drift_report)
    ```

    This code will update the data drift preset with the new data. The new data is fetched from the sklearn.datasets module. The column mapping is also updated to include the new columns from the new data. The report is then run with the new data and the updated column mapping. The report is then printed out.
