    The code you've provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the libraries pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn to perform text classification on a set of corporate documents. The notebook includes functions for loading and analyzing the documents, predicting the topic of each document, and visualizing the results using a heatmap.

    However, the code you've provided is not complete and does not include the complete functionality of the notebook. It's missing the part where the documents are loaded and analyzed, and the part where the results are visualized.

    The complete functionality of the notebook would include loading the documents, performing the text classification, and visualizing the results.

    Please provide the complete functionality of the notebook so that I can assist you better.
