    The code you provided is a part of a larger project, and it's not clear what the purpose of the code is. However, I can see that the code is augmenting the data by flipping the images. If you want to change this to not flipping the images, you can modify the `aug_transforms` function to not include the `augment_transforms` function. Here's how you can do it:

```python
def getDataLoaders(bs, size):
    pneumothorax = DataBlock(blocks=(ImageBlock(cls=PILDicom), CategoryBlock), 
                         get_items=get_dicom_files, 
                         get_y=label_func, 
                         batch_tfms=[*aug_transforms(size=size, do_flip=False)]
                         )
    dls = pneumothorax.dataloaders(path/'dicom-images-train', bs=bs)
    return dls
```

In this code, `do_flip=False` is used to prevent the images from being flipped. If you want to flip the images, you can remove this line or change it to `True`.
