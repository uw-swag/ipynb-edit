    The code you provided is a Python script that uses the deepchecks library to perform a calibration score check on a dataset. It also uses a logistic regression model to classify the data. However, the code is not complete and there are some issues with the syntax and the imports. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
from deepchecks.tabular.checks import CalibrationScore
from deepchecks.tabular import Dataset
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import pandas as pd
import warnings

def custom_formatwarning(msg, *args, **kwargs):
    # ignore everything except the message
    return str(msg) + '\n'

warnings.formatwarning = custom_formatwarning
from urllib.request import urlopen
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

name_data = urlopen('http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.names')
lines = [l.decode("utf-8") for l in name_data if ':' in l.decode("utf-8") and '|' not in l.decode("utf-8")]

features = [l.split(':')[0] for l in lines]
label_name = 'income'

cat_features = [l.split(':')[0] for l in lines if 'continuous' not in l]

train_df = pd.read_csv('http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data',
                       names=features + [label_name])
test_df = pd.read_csv('http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.test',
                      names=features + [label_name], skiprows=1)

test_df[label_name] = test_df [label_name].str[:-1]

encoder = LabelEncoder()
encoder.fit(train_df[label_name])
