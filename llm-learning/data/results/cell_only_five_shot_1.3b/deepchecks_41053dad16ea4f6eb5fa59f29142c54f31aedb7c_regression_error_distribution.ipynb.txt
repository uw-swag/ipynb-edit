    ### Update:
    The dataset properties have been updated as per the CCRMA workshop. The dataset has been split into a training set and a test set. The training set has 70% of the data and the test set has 30% of the data. The dataset is now a Pandas DataFrame and is split into two separate datasets, `train_df` and `test_df`. The `train_df` dataset contains 70% of the data and the `test_df` dataset contains 30% of the data. The `train` and `test` datasets are now created using the `Dataset` class from the `reco_utils.dataset` module. The class `GradientBoostingRegressor` is used to train the model.

    ### Code Explanation:
    The original code is loading the diabetes dataset, which is a regression dataset. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set. The training set is 70% of the data and the test set is 30% of the data. The `train_df` and `test_df` DataFrames are created using the `load_diabetes` function from the `reco_utils.dataset` module. The `Dataset` class is used to create the `train` and `test` datasets. The `GradientBoostingRegressor` class is used to train the model.

    ### Changes:
    - The dataset has been split into a training set and a test set.
    - The `train` and `test` datasets are created using the `Dataset` class.
