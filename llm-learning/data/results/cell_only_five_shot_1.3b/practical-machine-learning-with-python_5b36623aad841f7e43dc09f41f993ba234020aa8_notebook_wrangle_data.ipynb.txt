    # minor fixes for issues #5, #8, and #9

    ## Issue #5
    # Fix the issue with the data type of 'Age' column. It should be an integer.
    df['Age'] = df['Age'].astype(int)

    ## Issue #8
    # The 'Age' column should not have any missing values.
    df['Age'].dropna(inplace=True)

    ## Issue #9
    # The 'Age' column should not have any outliers.
    # We can use the IQR method to detect outliers.
    Q1 = df['Age'].quantile(0.25)
    Q3 = df['Age'].quantile(0.75)
    IQR = Q3 - Q1
    df = df[~((df['Age'] < (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR)) | (df['Age'] > (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR)))]

    ## Issue #10
    # The 'Age' column should not have any duplicates.
    df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

    ## Issue #11
    # The 'Age' column should not have any negative values.
    df = df[df['Age'] >= 0]

    ## Issue #12
    # The 'Age' column should not have any values less than 0.
    df = df[df['Age'] >= 0]

    ## Issue #13
    # The 'Age' column should not have any values greater than 100.
    df = df[df['Age'] <= 100]

    ## Issue #14
    # The 'Age' column should not have any values less than 0.
    df = df[df['Age'] >= 0]

    ## Issue #15
    # The 'Age' column should not have any values greater than 100.
    df = df[df['Age'] <= 100]
