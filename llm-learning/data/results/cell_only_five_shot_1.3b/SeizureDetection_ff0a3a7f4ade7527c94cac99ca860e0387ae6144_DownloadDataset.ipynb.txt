    ## Majority Class Undersampling
    ## Majority Class Undersampling is a type of undersampling where we remove the majority class samples from the dataset.
    ## This is done to reduce the number of samples in the minority class.

    ## Here is a simple implementation of majority class undersampling in Python using pandas:

    ```python
    import pandas as pd

    # Assuming df is your DataFrame and 'class' is the column with your target variable
    df_majority = df[df['class']==0]
    df_minority = df[df['class']==1]

    # Upsample minority class
    df_minority_upsampled = resample(df_minority, 
                                 replace=True,     # with replacement
                                 n_samples=df_majority.shape[0],    # to match majority class
                                 random_state=123) # reproducible results

    # Combine majority class with upsampled minority class
    df_upsampled = pd.concat([df_majority, df_minority_upsampled])

    # Check the new class counts
    df_upsampled.groupby('class').count()
    ```

    ## This code will undersample the majority class to match the number of samples in the minority class.

    ## Please note that this is a simple implementation and may not work well for all datasets. The choice of undersampling method depends on the specific characteristics of your dataset.
