    # This Python code is used to create a new notebook using Google Colaboratory.

    # Import necessary libraries
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

    # Load the dataset
    df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

    # Preprocess the data
    # This step depends on the dataset. You may need to handle missing values, outliers, etc.

    # Split the data into features and target variable
    X = df.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
    y = df['target_variable']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Standardize the features
    sc = StandardScaler()
    X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = sc.transform(X_test)

    # Create a Logistic Regression model
    model = LogisticRegression()

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')

    # Cross-validation
    cv_scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)
    print(f'Cross-validation scores: {cv_scores}')
    print(f'Mean cross-validation score: {np.mean(cv_scores)}')

    This code creates a new notebook in Google Colaboratory, loads a dataset, preprocesses the data
