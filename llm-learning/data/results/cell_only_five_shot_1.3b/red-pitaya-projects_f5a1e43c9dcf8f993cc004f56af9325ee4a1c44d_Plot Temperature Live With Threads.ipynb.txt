    The code you've provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses matplotlib and pandas to create a live plot of temperature data. The plot is updated every second using a thread, and the data is collected from an XADC (analog to digital converter) device.

    The notebook starts by importing necessary libraries and defining a function to collect data. This function is run in a separate thread, and it collects data every second and appends it to a pandas DataFrame.

    The main part of the notebook is the animate function, which is called every second. It clears the current plot, plots the new data, and displays the plot.

    The FuncAnimation function is used to animate the plot, updating it every 2000 milliseconds (or 2 seconds).

    The last part of the notebook is the plotting part. It creates a figure, adds a subplot to it, and then calls the animate function to update the plot.

    The code is not complete, as it lacks the part where the data is collected from the XADC device. The `!xadc_get_value_temp` command is used to get the temperature value from the XADC device, but it's not defined in the provided code.

    If you want to add the part to collect data from the XADC device, you would need to use a library like `pyadc` to interact with the device. However, this would require additional setup and configuration, and the code would be more complex.
