```python
    from deepchecks.suites import overall_suite

    suite = overall_suite()
    # now we can use the check's index and the condition's number to remove it:
    suite[6].remove_condition(0)
    ```
    This code is used to remove a condition from a specific suite in the DeepChecks library. The condition is identified by its index and the number of the condition within the suite.
