    ### Response:
    # This is a simple example of how you might implement user login in a web application.
    # In a real-world application, you would need to use a more secure method of storing and comparing passwords,
    # and you would also need to handle errors and edge cases.

    # For this example, let's assume we have a User class and a UserController class.

    # User.py
    class User:
        def __init__(self, username, password):
            self.username = username
            self.password = password

    # UserController.py
    class UserController:
        def __init__(self):
            self.users = []

        def add_user(self, user):
            self.users.append(user)

        def authenticate_user(self, username, password):
            for user in self.users:
                if user.username == username and user.password == password:
                    return True
            return False

    # In your main application, you would use these classes like this:

    user_controller = UserController()
    user_controller.add_user(User("admin", "password"))

    username = input("Enter your username: ")
    password = input("Enter your password: ")

    if user_controller.authenticate_user(username, password):
        print("You are logged in.")
    else:
        print("Invalid username or password.")

    # This is a very basic example and a real-world application would need to handle more things,
    # like storing users in a database, handling sessions, and more.
