    The code you provided is a TensorFlow 0.12 code snippet that restores a TensorFlow model and saves it in a new TensorFlow 0.12 model format. 

    The code is divided into two parts:

    1. The first part creates a TensorFlow graph and restores a TensorFlow model. The model is then converted to a TensorFlow 0.12 model format.

    2. The second part creates a new TensorFlow 0.12 model and saves it to a file.

    The issue you mentioned is a TensorFlow 0.12 model format issue. The TensorFlow 0.12 model format is not backward compatible with the TensorFlow 1.x model format. This means that you cannot load a TensorFlow 0.12 model into a TensorFlow 1.x session and expect it to work correctly.

    The issue you mentioned is related to the TensorFlow 0.12 model format and the TensorFlow 1.x model format. The TensorFlow 0.12 model format is not backward compatible with the TensorFlow 1.x model format. This means that you cannot load a TensorFlow 0.12 model into a TensorFlow 1.x session and expect it to work correctly.
