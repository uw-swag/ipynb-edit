    This code will generate a ROC curve and calculate the area under the curve. The ROC curve is a plot of the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at different threshold settings. The area under the curve (AUC) is a measure of the model's performance.

    The code is assuming that you have a model `model` that can predict probabilities of the positive class. The `predict_proba` function is a method of the model that returns the probability of the positive class for each instance. The `roc_curve` function is a function that computes the ROC curve, and the `auc` function is a function that computes the area under the ROC curve.

    The code then plots the ROC curve, and finally shows the plot.
