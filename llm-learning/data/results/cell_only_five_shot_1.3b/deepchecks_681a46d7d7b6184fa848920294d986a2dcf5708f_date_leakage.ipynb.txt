    Here's the refactored version of the code with the markdown formatting and error correction:

    ```python
    ## Checks for date leakage

    The checks in this suite are designed to detect and prevent the occurrence of duplicate or overlapping dates in the training and validation datasets.

    ### Steps

    1. **DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates**: This check will identify and report any instances where the same date is present in both the training and validation datasets.

    2. **DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap**: This check will identify and report any instances where the same date is present in both the training and validation datasets, but the date is not unique.

    ### Steps for refactoring

    The steps for refactoring are as follows:

    1. Rename the `Checksuite` to `Suite`.
    2. Rename the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` to `DateDuplicates`.
    3. Rename the `DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap` to `DateOverlap`.
    4. Remove the redundant `n_to_show` parameter from the `DateDuplicates` check.

    ### Refactored Code

    ```python
    from mlchecks.checks.leakage import DateOverlap, DateDuplicates
    from mlchecks.base import Dataset, CheckSuite
    from datetime import datetime
    import pandas as pd

    def dataset_from_dict(d: dict, date_name: str = None) -> Dataset:
        dataframe = pd.DataFrame(data=d)
        return Dataset(dataframe, date=date_name)

    train_ds = dataset_from_dict({'col1': [
        datetime(2021, 10, 3, 0, 0),
        datetime(2021, 10, 3, 0, 0),
        datetime(2021, 10, 4, 0, 0),
        datetime(2021, 10, 4, 0, 0),
