    The code you provided is a demonstration of how to use the evidently library to analyze and visualize the data drift in an Iris dataset. The first part of the code imports the necessary libraries and loads the Iris dataset.

    The second part of the code creates a Dashboard object and calculates the data drift for the Iris dataset. The Dashboard object is then displayed using the `show()` method.

    The third part of the code creates a Profile object and calculates the data drift for the Iris dataset. The Profile object is then converted to JSON format and printed.

    The last part of the code is a placeholder for the GitBook documentation. The documentation is not included in the provided code, but it could be moved to the repository as needed.

    The code is organized in a way that makes it easy to follow along with the tutorial and to understand the process of using the evidently library.

    The commit message "Examples reorganisation and moving GitBook docs to repo (#116)" is a clear and concise description of the changes made. It indicates that the code has been reorganized and the GitBook documentation has been moved to the repository.
