    The Python version has been updated from 3.6 to 3.8. The updated Python version is necessary because Python 3.8 introduces several new features and improvements that are not available in Python 3.6.

    Here are the changes:

    1. `faulthandler`: This module is used to catch and report uncaught exceptions.
    2. `sys.version`: This command is used to get the Python version.
    3. `tf.__version__`: This command is used to get the TensorFlow version.
    4. `os.environ.get('TF_CONFIG', 'Not found')`: This command is used to get the TensorFlow configuration.
    5. `device_lib.list_local_devices()`: This command is used to list the local devices.
    6. `tfds.disable_progress_bar()`: This command is used to disable the progress bar.
    7. `tf.distribute.OneDeviceStrategy(device='/gpu:0')`: This command is used to set the distribution strategy to a single GPU device.
    8. `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()`: This command is used to set the distribution strategy to a single GPU device with a mirrored strategy.
    9. `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy()`: This command is used to set the distribution strategy to multiple GPU devices with a mirrored strategy.
    10. `tf.data.Options()`: This command is used to set the options for the dataset.
    11. `tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE`: This command is used to automatically tune the dataset.
    12. `tf.cast(image, tf.float32) / 255.`: This command is used to normalize the image.
    13. `tf.image.resize(image, (300,300))`: This command is used to resize the image.
    14. `tf.keras.Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)`: This command is used to create the model.
    15. `tf.keras.losses.
