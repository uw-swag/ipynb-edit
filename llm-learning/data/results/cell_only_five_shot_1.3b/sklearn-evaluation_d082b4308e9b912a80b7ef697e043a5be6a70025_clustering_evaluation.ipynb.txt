```python

    from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score
    from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # define the number of clusters
    num_clusters = 5

    # create a KMeans instance
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=num_clusters)

    # fit the model to the data
    kmeans.fit(X)

    # get the cluster labels
    cluster_labels = kmeans.labels_

    # calculate the silhouette score
    silhouette_score = silhouette_score(X, cluster_labels)

    # plot the silhouette plot
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.axvline(x=0.03, color="k", linestyle="--")
    plt.axhline(y=0.03, color="k", linestyle="--")
    plt.scatter(range(num_clusters), silhouette_scores, c=cluster_labels, cmap="Dark2")

    plt.xlabel("Silhouette score")
    plt.ylabel("Cluster index")
    plt.show()
    ```
    The code above calculates the silhouette score and plots the silhouette plot. The silhouette score ranges from -1 to 1, where a high value indicates that the sample is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters.
