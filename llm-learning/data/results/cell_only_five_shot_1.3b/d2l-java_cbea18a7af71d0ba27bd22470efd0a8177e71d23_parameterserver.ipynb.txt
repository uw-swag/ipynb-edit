    ### 12.3. Introduction to the SVM model

    Support Vector Machines (SVM) are a powerful machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. SVMs are particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces, which makes them ideal for data that is not linearly separable.

    ### 12.4. Implementing SVM with Python

    Here is a simple example of how to implement SVM with Python using the scikit-learn library.

    ```python
    from sklearn import datasets
    from sklearn import svm

    # Load the iris dataset
    iris = datasets.load_iris()

    # Create a SVM classifier
    clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear')

    # Train the model
    clf.fit(iris.data, iris.target)

    # Predict the response for test dataset
    y_pred = clf.predict(iris.data)
    ```

    ### 12.7. Evaluating the SVM model

    After training the model, it's important to evaluate its performance. This can be done using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

    ```python
    from sklearn import metrics

    # Model Accuracy
    print("Accuracy:", metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))

    # Model Precision
    print("Precision:", metrics.precision_score(y_test, y_pred))

    # Model Recall
    print("Recall:", metrics.recall_score(y_test, y_pred))
    ```

    This will give you a basic understanding of how to implement and evaluate an SVM model using Python.
