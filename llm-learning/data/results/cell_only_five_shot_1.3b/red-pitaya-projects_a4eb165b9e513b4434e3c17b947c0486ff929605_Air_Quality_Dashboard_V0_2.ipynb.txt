    The code you provided is a Python script that uses the `pandas`, `math`, `time`, `math`, `analog_sensor`, `GPIO`, and `matplotlib` libraries to read data from an analog sensor, process it, and display it in a graphical user interface (GUI).

    The code includes:

    - Reading data from an analog sensor using the `analog_sensor` library.
    - Processing the data using the `pandas` library.
    - Displaying the processed data in a graphical user interface using the `matplotlib` and `ipywidgets` libraries.

    The code also includes a function `res_to_temp` that converts the resistance of a thermistor to temperature.

    The code also includes a function `temp` that reads the temperature from the analog sensor and returns it along with the voltage.

    The code also includes a function `work` that reads the data from the analog sensors, processes it, and updates the GUI.

    The code also includes a function `VBox` that creates a vertical box with the GUI components.

    The code also includes a function `threading.active_count()` that returns the number of threads that are currently active in the system.

    The code also includes a function `update_air_quality = False` that stops the `work` function from running.

    The code also includes a function `thread.start()` that starts the `work` function in a new thread.

    The code also includes a function `first_box = HBox([voc_bar, voc_label])` that creates a horizontal box with the GUI components.

    The code also includes a function `second_box = HBox([temp_bar, temp_slider])` that creates a horizontal box with the GUI components.

    The code also includes a function `third_box = HBox([alcohol_bar, alcohol_label])` that creates a horizontal box with the GUI components.

    The code also includes a function `VBox([first_box, second_box, third_box])` that creates a vertical box with the GUI components.

    The code also includes a function `threading.active_count()` that returns the number
