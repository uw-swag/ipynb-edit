```
    from mlchecks.base import Dataset
    import inspect

    ds = Dataset(df, index='ssss')
    ds = ds.filter_columns_with_validation(columns=['target'])

    set(dir(ds)) - set(dir(pd.DataFrame))
    ```
    The code above is a simple example of how to use the mlchecks library to check the dataset for missing or incorrect data. The `Dataset` class is used to create a new dataset from a pandas DataFrame. The `filter_columns_with_validation` method is used to filter out columns that are not valid for the dataset. The `set(dir(ds)) - set(dir(pd.DataFrame))` part is checking if the `Dataset` class has any methods that are not present in the `pd.DataFrame` class. If there are any, it means that the `Dataset` class is not compatible with the `pd.DataFrame` class, which is a common issue when working with pandas DataFrames.

    The mlchecks library is a great tool for checking the quality of your data, but it's not a part of the standard Python library. You need to install it using pip:

    ```
    pip install mlchecks
    ```

    Also, please note that the `Dataset` class is not a part of the mlchecks library, it's a part of the `mlchecks.dataset` module.
