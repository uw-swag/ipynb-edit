    The code you provided is a part of a larger project, and it's not clear what the purpose of the code is. It's a mix of different libraries and techniques, and it seems to be a part of a machine learning pipeline.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    1. The code imports several libraries and modules.
    2. It then sets up a Spark context and reads a MMTF file.
    3. It then performs a stratified k-fold cross-validation on the data.
    4. It clones a classifier and fits it to the training data.
    5. It then makes predictions on the test data.
    6. It then implements a function that uses a custom method to perform cross-validation.
    7. It then uses a random forest classifier to make predictions on the test data.
    8. It then calculates the ROC curve and plots it.
    9. Finally, it uses a dummy classifier to make predictions on the test data.
