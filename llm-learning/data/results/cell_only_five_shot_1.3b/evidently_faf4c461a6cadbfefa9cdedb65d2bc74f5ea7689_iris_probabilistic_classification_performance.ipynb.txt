    The code you provided is a Python script that uses the scikit-learn library to train a logistic regression model on the Iris dataset. It then calculates a dashboard and a profile for the model's performance.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The code first imports necessary libraries and modules.
    - It then loads the Iris dataset and splits it into a training set and a test set.
    - It creates a logistic regression model and trains it on the training set.
    - It then calculates the predicted probabilities for both the training and test sets.
    - It creates a column mapping for the Iris dataset.
    - It then calculates a dashboard and a profile for the model's performance.
    - The dashboard is then displayed, and the profile is saved as a JSON file.

    The code is organized into several steps:

    - Importing necessary libraries and modules.
    - Loading the Iris dataset and splitting it into a training set and a test set.
    - Creating a logistic regression model and training it on the training set.
    - Calculating the predicted probabilities for both the training and test sets.
    - Creating a column mapping for the Iris dataset.
    - Calculating a dashboard and a profile for the model's performance.
    - Displaying the dashboard and saving the profile as a JSON file.

    The code is organized in a way that makes it easy to understand and maintain. It follows the principle of separation of concerns, with the model training, prediction, and evaluation being separate tasks.

    The code is also well-documented, with comments explaining what each part of the code does. This makes it easier for other developers to understand and use the code.

    The code is also formatted with appropriate indentation and spacing to make it easier to read.

    The code is also well-structured, with clear variable names and function calls. This makes it easier to understand the code's purpose and functionality.
