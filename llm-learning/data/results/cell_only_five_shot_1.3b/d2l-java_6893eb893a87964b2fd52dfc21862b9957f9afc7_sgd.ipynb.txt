```python
    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn
    import torch.optim as optim

    # Define a simple neural network
    class Net(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self):
            super(Net, self).__init__()
            self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 10)
            self.fc2 = nn.Linear(10, 1)

        def forward(self, x):
            x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
            x = self.fc2(x)
            return x

    # Create a simple dataset
    x_train = torch.randn(100, 10)
    y_train = x_train.sum(1) + 0.1 * torch.randn(100, 1)

    # Create a model and a loss function
    model = Net()
    criterion = nn.MSELoss()
    optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

    # Train the model
    for epoch in range(100):
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(x_train)
        loss = criterion(output, y_train)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    # Test the model
    x_test = torch.randn(10, 10)
    output = model(x_test)
    print(output)
    ```
    This is a simple example of a neural network using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in PyTorch. The model is a simple neural network with one hidden layer, and the loss function is mean squared error. The model is trained for 100 epochs, and then the model is tested on a new dataset.
