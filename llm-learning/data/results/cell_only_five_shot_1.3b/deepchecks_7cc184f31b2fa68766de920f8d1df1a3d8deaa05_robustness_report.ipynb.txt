The code you provided is already split into multiple cells. The cells are already well-structured and follow the standard Python syntax. The code is loading a dataset, training a model, and then running a robustness report on the dataset.

The code is splitting the VisionData and removing the formatters, which is a common practice in data preprocessing. The formatters are used to transform the data into a format that can be used by the model. In this case, the formatters are not needed as the data is already in the correct format.

Here's the code again for reference:

```python
from deepchecks.vision.datasets.classification.mnist import load_dataset, load_model, mnist_prediction_formatter

mnist_dataloader_test = load_dataset(train=False, batch_size=1000, object_type='VisionData')
model = load_model()
from deepchecks.vision.checks.performance.robustness_report import RobustnessReport
from deepchecks.vision.utils.classification_formatters import ClassificationPredictionFormatter

prediction_formatter = ClassificationPredictionFormatter(mnist_prediction_formatter)
result = RobustnessReport().run(mnist_dataloader_test, model, prediction_formatter=prediction_formatter)
result
check = RobustnessReport().add_condition_degradation_not_greater_than(0.05)
result = check.run(mnist_dataloader_test, model, prediction_formatter=prediction_formatter)
result.show(show_additional_outputs=False)
```

This code will load the MNIST dataset, train a model, and then run a robustness report on the dataset. The robustness report will check if the model's predictions are significantly degraded when the threshold is 0.05.
