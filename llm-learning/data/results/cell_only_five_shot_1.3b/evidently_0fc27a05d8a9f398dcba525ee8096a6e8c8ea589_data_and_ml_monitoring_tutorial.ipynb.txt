The code you provided is for adding two panels to a Jupyter notebook's dashboard. The first panel is for a line plot of the count of rows in a dataset summary metric, and the second panel is for a line plot of the share of drifting features (PSI > 0.3).

The commit message "Fix SemanticSimilarity / CustomDescriptor index values. (#1120)" suggests that there's a bug or issue with the code where the index values for the SemanticSimilarity and CustomDescriptor metrics are not being set correctly.

The original code is not provided, but I can't see any specific issue with the code. If you're seeing an error or unexpected behavior, please provide the error message or describe the issue in more detail.

If you're seeing an error or unexpected behavior, you should check the following:

1. Ensure that the index values for the SemanticSimilarity and CustomDescriptor metrics are being set correctly.
2. Check the documentation or source code of the metrics for any specific requirements or constraints.
3. Ensure that the index values for the SemanticSimilarity and CustomDescriptor metrics are being set correctly in the code.

If you're still experiencing issues, please provide the error message or describe the issue in more detail.
