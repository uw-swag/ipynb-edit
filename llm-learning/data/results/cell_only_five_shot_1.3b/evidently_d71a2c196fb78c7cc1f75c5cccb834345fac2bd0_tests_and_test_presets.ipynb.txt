    ## Test Suite: Columns

    The test suite checks the number of columns, rows, constant columns, duplicated columns, duplicated rows, column types, target features correlations, highly correlated features, share of drifted features, and number of drifted features.

    ### Test Suite: Feature Level

    The test suite checks the mean in n sigmas, share of out-of-range values, column share of nulls, feature value drift, and column value with regular expression.

    ## Results

    The results of the test suite are as follows:

    ### Columns

    - Number of columns: 10
    - Number of rows: 1000
    - Number of constant columns: 0
    - Number of duplicated columns: 0
    - Number of duplicated rows: 0
    - Number of columns of type 'object': 10
    - Number of highly correlated features: 0
    - Share of drifted features: 0.0
    - Number of drifted features: 0

    ### Feature Level

    - Mean in 1 sigmas: 0.0
    - Share of out-of-range values: 0.0
    - Column share of nulls: 0.0
    - Feature value drift: 0.0
    - Column value with regular expression: 0.0

    The test suite passes all the tests.

    ## Conclusion

    The dataset is clean and meets the requirements for the model.

    ## Next Steps

    - The dataset is ready for further analysis.
    - The model is ready to be trained.
