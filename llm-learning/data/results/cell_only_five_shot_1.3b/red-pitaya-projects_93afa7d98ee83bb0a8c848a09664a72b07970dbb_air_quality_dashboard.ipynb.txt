    This code sets up a simple program that reads the value from a GPIO pin connected to the alcohol sensor. The sensor is connected to a Raspberry Pi and the pin number is 18. The program reads the value every second and prints it to the console.

    Please note that this is a simple example and may not work as expected in a real-world application. The sensor value is printed to the console, but you may want to use this value in a more complex way, such as sending it to a server or storing it in a database.
