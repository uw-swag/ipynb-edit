    ## Concurrency

    Concurrency is a programming concept where two or more tasks can start, run, and complete at the same time. In the context of web development, concurrency can be used to improve the performance of a web application by allowing multiple requests to be processed at the same time.

    ### Types of Concurrency

    There are several types of concurrency in web development:

    #### Single-threaded concurrency

    This is the most common type of concurrency. In single-threaded concurrency, only one task is being executed at a time. This is the default mode in most web browsers.

    #### Multi-threaded concurrency

    In multi-threaded concurrency, two or more tasks are being executed at the same time. This is often used to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

    #### Asynchronous concurrency

    In asynchronous concurrency, tasks are not being executed one after the other. Instead, they are queued and executed in the background. This is often used to perform I/O-bound tasks, such as downloading files from the internet.

    #### Event-driven concurrency

    In event-driven concurrency, tasks are not being executed one after the other, but are executed in response to events, such as user actions or network messages. This is often used to perform I/O-bound tasks, such as downloading files from the internet.

    ### Benefits of Concurrency

    Concurrency can have several benefits:

    #### Improved Performance

    By allowing multiple tasks to be executed at the same time, web servers can process more requests in parallel, which can lead to improved performance.

    #### Better User Experience

    Concurrent tasks can also improve the user experience, as they can be executed in the background, which can lead to a smoother and more responsive user experience.

    #### Scalability

    Concurrency can also be used to scale up a web application, as it can handle more requests than a single-threaded application.

    ### Concurrency in Python

    Python has a built-in module called `concurrent.futures` that provides a high-level interface for asynchronously executing callables. This can be used to implement concurrency in Python.
