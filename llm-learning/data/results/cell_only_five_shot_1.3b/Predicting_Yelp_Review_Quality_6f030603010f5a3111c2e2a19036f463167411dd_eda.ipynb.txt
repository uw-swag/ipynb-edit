    The code you provided is used to create a bar graph for a dataframe. The graph shows the percentage of reviews that receive a certain number of useful, funny, or cool votes.

    The graph is created using the matplotlib library in Python. The dataframe is first loaded into a variable named 'df'. The number of useful, funny, or cool votes are counted for each possible number of votes. These counts are then divided by the total number of reviews to get the percentage of reviews that receive each number of votes.

    The graph is then displayed using the plt.show() function. The graph is saved as a png image in the '../images/' directory.

    The function 'autolabel' is used to label the bars on the graph with the corresponding vote count. This function is used to display the vote count on each bar.

    The graph is created with the plt.bar() function, which creates a bar chart. The x-values are the vote counts, the y-values are the corresponding percentages of reviews, and the tick_label parameter is used to label the x-axis with the vote counts.

    The plt.xlabel(), plt.ylabel(), and plt.title() functions are used to set the x-label, y-label, and title of the graph, respectively.

    The plt.tight_layout() function is used to adjust the layout of the plot to prevent overlap of the labels.

    The plt.savefig() function is used to save the graph as a png image. The dpi parameter is used to specify the resolution of the image, and bbox_inches and pad_inches parameters are used to adjust the layout of the image.

    The plt.show() function is used to display the graph.

    The code you provided is a good example of how to create a bar graph using matplotlib in Python.
