    ### Explanation:
    The function `create_dataset` is used to create a dataset from the given data. The data is split into a training set and a testing set using the `python_random_split` function. The training and testing datasets are then created using the `Dataset` class.

    The function is decorated with the `@staticmethod` decorator, which means it can be called on the class itself, not on an instance of the class. This is useful for methods that don't need access to instance-specific data.

    The function also takes an optional `random_state` parameter, which is used to seed the random number generator. This is useful for reproducibility.

    The function returns a tuple containing the training and testing datasets.

    The `split_ratio` parameter is used to specify the ratio of the data to split for the training and testing sets. The `random_state` parameter is used to seed the random number generator.

    The `Dataset` class is a custom class that is used to create a dataset from a pandas DataFrame. The `Dataset` class has a `__init__` method that takes a pandas DataFrame and stores it, and a `__getitem__` method that allows the dataset to be indexed like a regular DataFrame.
