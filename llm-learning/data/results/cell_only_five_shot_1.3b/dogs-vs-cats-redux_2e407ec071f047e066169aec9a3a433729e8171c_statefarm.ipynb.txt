    The code you provided is a Python script that uses a deep learning model to classify images. The script includes several steps, including loading data, defining a convolutional neural network model, training the model, and making predictions.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    1. The script starts by importing necessary libraries and defining some global variables.

    2. It then loads the training and validation data, and prepares the labels for the data.

    3. The script defines a function `conv1` that creates a convolutional neural network model. This function is then used to train the model.

    4. The script also defines a function `get_bn_layers` that creates a batch normalization layer.

    5. The script then trains the model for several epochs, and makes predictions on the test data.

    6. The script saves the model weights, and makes a submission file.

    7. The script also includes a section that generates a pseudo-label for the validation data, and trains the model on this pseudo-label.

    8. The script also includes a section that uses a random permutation of the drivers to split the data into two sets.

    9. The script also includes a section that uses a convolutional neural network to make predictions on the test data, and calculates the average prediction.

    The final section of the code is a function that uses a convolutional neural network to make predictions on the test data, and calculates the average prediction.

    The code is designed to be run in a Jupyter notebook, and it uses the Theano library for deep learning.

    Please note that the code is a simplified version of the original one and may not work as expected.
