    ## Card Activation

    This notebook is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the card activation process.

    The card activation process involves the following steps:

    1. **Initialization**: The first step is to initialize the card. This involves setting the card's initial state to "activated".

    2. **Activation**: The card is then activated. This involves the card's internal circuitry being powered on.

    3. **Card Activation**: The card is activated. This involves the card's internal circuitry being powered on.

    4. **Card Deactivation**: The card is deactivated. This involves the card's internal circuitry being powered off.

    The notebook will provide a detailed explanation of each step, along with any relevant code snippets.
