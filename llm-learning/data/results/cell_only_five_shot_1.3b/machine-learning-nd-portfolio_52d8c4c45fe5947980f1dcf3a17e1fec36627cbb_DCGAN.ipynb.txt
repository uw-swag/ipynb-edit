    ## Folder Structure

    The project is organized in the following way:

    ```
    - /data
        - raw
        - processed
        - interim
    - /notebooks
        - initial_data_exploration.ipynb
        - data_preprocessing.ipynb
        - feature_engineering.ipynb
        - model_training.ipynb
        - model_evaluation.ipynb
    - /scripts
        - data_preprocessing.py
        - feature_engineering.py
        - model_training.py
        - model_evaluation.py
    - /models
        - model1.pkl
        - model2.pkl
        - model3.pkl
    - /reports
        - project_report.md
        - findings.md
        - recommendations.md
    ```
    The `data` folder contains the raw data, processed data, and interim data.
    The `notebooks` folder contains the Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and model evaluation.
    The `scripts` folder contains the Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and model evaluation.
    The `models` folder contains the trained models.
    The `reports` folder contains the project report, findings, and recommendations.
    ```
    The project structure is consistent with the principles of the PEP8 style guide, which is a popular style guide for Python code.
