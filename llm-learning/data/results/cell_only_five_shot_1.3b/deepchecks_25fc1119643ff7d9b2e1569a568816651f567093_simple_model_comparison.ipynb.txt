    ## Adding nblinks instead of copy (#292)

    The code cell you're referring to is a Jupyter notebook cell that includes a code block. The cell is not a copy of the original code, but a result of a computation or transformation.

    The `nblinks` parameter in the `@nblinks` directive is used to specify the number of links in the notebook. The number of links in a cell is determined by the number of code blocks in the cell.

    In the code you provided, there are three code blocks:

    1. The first code block imports the necessary libraries and modules.
    2. The second code block loads the iris dataset from sklearn.
    3. The third code block splits the dataset into a training set and a test set.

    The `nblinks` parameter in the `@nblinks` directive is set to 3, which means that the notebook will create three links in the cell.

    The notebook will create a link for each code block in the cell. This is useful for providing a visual representation of the code and for understanding the structure of the code.

    The notebook will also create a link for the model comparison check. This is useful for providing a visual representation of the model comparison and for understanding the structure of the model comparison.

    The notebook will create a link for the dataset creation. This is useful for providing a visual representation of the dataset and for understanding the structure of the dataset.

    The notebook will create a link for the model training. This is useful for providing a visual representation of the model training and for understanding the structure of the model training.

    The notebook will create a link for the model evaluation. This is useful for providing a visual representation of the model evaluation and for understanding the structure of the model evaluation.

    The notebook will create a link for the model prediction. This is useful for providing a visual representation of the model prediction and for understanding the structure of the model prediction.

    The notebook will create a link for the model tuning. This is useful for providing a visual representation of the model tuning and for understanding the structure of the model tuning.

    The notebook will create a link for the model validation. This is useful for providing a visual representation
