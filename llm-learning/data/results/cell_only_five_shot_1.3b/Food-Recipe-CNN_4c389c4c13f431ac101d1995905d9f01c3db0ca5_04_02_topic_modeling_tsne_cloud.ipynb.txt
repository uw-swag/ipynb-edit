```python
    import os
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from PIL import Image

    # Assume that you have a directory with images
    image_dir = '/path/to/your/images'

    # Get a list of all image files
    image_files = [f for f in os.listdir(image_dir) if f.endswith('.jpg')]

    # Loop through each image file
    for image_file in image_files:
        # Open the image file
        img = Image.open(os.path.join(image_dir, image_file))

        # Check if the image is broken
        if img.mode != 'RGB':
            # If the image is broken, fix it
            img = img.convert('RGB')

        # Save the fixed image
        img.save(os.path.join(image_dir, image_file))
    ```

    This script will fix any broken images in the specified directory. It does this by converting any image that is not in the 'RGB' mode to the 'RGB' mode.
