The code you provided is a series of data story updates for a data science project. Here's a brief explanation of what each part of the code does:

1. **Data Fetching and Preprocessing**: The code imports necessary libraries and fetches the adult dataset from the sklearn datasets. It then prepares a sample of the data with some random changes.

2. **Column Mapping**: The code defines the column mapping for the data, which includes numerical and categorical features.

3. **Data Drift Calculation**: The code calculates the data drift for the sample data. It uses the `DataDriftTab` from the `evidently` library to display the data drift visualization.

4. **Statistical Testing**: The code applies the Anderson's K-sample test to the data, which is a non-parametric test for the distribution of a sample from a population. The p-value is compared to a given threshold, and if the p-value is less than the threshold, the test is considered statistically significant.

5. **Target Drift Calculation**: The code calculates the target drift for the sample data. It uses the `CatTargetDriftTab` from the `evidently` library to display the target drift visualization.

6. **Data Drift Visualization**: The code calculates the data drift and displays the visualization of the data drift.

7. **Target Drift Visualization**: The code calculates the target drift and displays the visualization of the target drift.

Please note that the code is a part of a larger data science project and it's not a standalone code. It's part of a larger pipeline and the code is used to update the data stories in a data science project.
