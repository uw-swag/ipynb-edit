```python
    import json
    import requests

    def fetch_intents():
        response = requests.get('https://online-json-storage.com/intents.json')
        data = json.loads(response.text)
        return data

    def predict_class(message, model):
        intents = fetch_intents()
        # Assuming predict_class is a function that takes a message and a model and returns a prediction
        prediction = model.predict(message)
        # Assuming getResponse is a function that takes a prediction and a list of intents and returns a response
        response = getResponse(prediction, intents)
        return response

    def getResponse(prediction, intents):
        # Assuming getResponse is a function that takes a prediction and a list of intents and returns a response
        for intent in intents:
            if prediction in intent['responses']:
                return intent['responses'][prediction]
        return "I'm sorry, I didn't understand that."
    ```
    This code fetches the intents from an online JSON storage and uses them to predict the class of a message. It then uses the predicted class to return a response.
