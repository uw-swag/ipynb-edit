```python
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

    # Load the dataset
    df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

    # Feature engineering
    # TF-IDF vectorizer
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=2000, min_df=5, max_df=0.7, stop_words=stopwords.words('english'))
    X = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['your_text_column']).toarray()

    # Save the vectorizer
    with open('vectorizer.pkl', 'wb') as f:
        pickle.dump(vectorizer, f)

    # Save the TF-IDF matrix
    with open('tfidf_matrix.pkl', 'wb') as f:
        pickle.dump(X, f)
    ```

    This code will perform the following:
    1. Load a dataset.
    2. Perform TF-IDF vectorization on the text data.
    3. Save the vectorizer and TF-IDF matrix for future use.

    Please replace 'your_dataset.csv' and 'your_text_column' with your actual dataset and text column names.

    Also, make sure to install the necessary libraries (`pandas`, `sklearn`, `nltk`) if they are not installed.

    Please note that this is a basic example. Depending on your specific use case, you may need to adjust the feature engineering process.
