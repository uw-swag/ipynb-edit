    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the TensorFlow and Keras libraries to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification. The model is trained on a dataset of handwritten digits, and the accuracy of the model is evaluated.

    The code is divided into several sections:

    1. The import statements and the model definition.
    2. The data loading and preprocessing.
    3. The model training.
    4. The model evaluation.
    5. The model prediction.

    The code is divided into three parts:

    - The first part is the import statements and the model definition.
    - The second part is the data loading and preprocessing.
    - The third part is the model training.
    - The fourth part is the model evaluation.
    - The fifth part is the model prediction.
