    The code you provided is a Spark application that uses the Apache Spark framework to train a model. The Spark version used in the code is 0.11.0. The number of cores set in the SparkConf is 4, which is different from the default setting.

    Here's the updated code:

    ```python
    conf = SparkConf().setMaster("local[4]") \
                      .setAppName("FilterByReleaseDate")
    sc = SparkContext(conf = conf)
    ```

    This code sets the number of cores to 4 in the SparkConf, which is different from the default setting.
