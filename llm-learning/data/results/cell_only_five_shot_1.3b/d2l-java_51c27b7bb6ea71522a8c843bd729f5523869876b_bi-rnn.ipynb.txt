    ## 9.4.1: Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks

    # Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (BRNNs) are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that can process sequences in both directions. This means that the information in the sequence is processed from left to right and from right to left, which allows the model to understand the context of the sequence.

    ### 9.4.2: Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks

    # Bidirectional RNNs are a type of RNN that can process sequences in both directions. This means that the information in the sequence is processed from left to right and from right to left, which allows the model to understand the context of the sequence.

    ### 9.4.3: Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks

    # Bidirectional RNNs are a type of RNN that can process sequences in both directions. This means that the information in the sequence is processed from left to right and from right to left, which allows the model to understand the context of the sequence.

    ## 9.4.4: Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks

    # Bidirectional RNNs are a type of RNN that can process sequences in both directions. This means that the information in the sequence is processed from left to right and from right to left, which allows the model to understand the context of the sequence.

    ## 9.4.5: Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks

    # Bidirectional RNNs are a type of RNN that can process sequences in both directions. This means that the information in the sequence is processed from left to right and from right to left, which allows the model to understand the context of the sequence.

    ## 9.4.6: Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks

    # Bidirectional RNNs are a type of RNN that can process sequences in both directions. This means that the information in the sequence is processed from left to right and from right to left, which allows the model to understand the context of the sequence.
