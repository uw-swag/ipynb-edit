    # New Example
    # -----------

    # Let's say we have a list of numbers:

    ```python
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    ```

    # We can use the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of these numbers:

    ```python
    sum_of_numbers = sum(numbers)
    print(sum_of_numbers)  # Output: 15
    ```

    # New Installation Docs
    # ---------------------

    # To install the `pandas_profiling` package, you can use pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas_profiling
    ```

    # Or, if you prefer, you can install it from source:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling.git
    cd pandas-profiling
    python setup.py install
    ```

    # After installation, you can import the `pandas_profiling` module in your Python script:

    ```python
    import pandas_profiling
    ```

    # And then use its functions and methods. For example, you can load a CSV file:

    ```python
    report = pandas_profiling.ProfileReport("your_file.csv")
    report.to_file("report.html")
    ```

    This is a new example and new installation docs for the `pandas_profiling` package.
