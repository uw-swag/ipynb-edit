    The provided code is a Jupyter notebook that uses the evidently library to run a suite of tests on a dataset. The tests include tests for the share of drifted features, the number of drifted features, and the feature value drift.

    The code is divided into two parts:

    1. The first part of the code is the original code that uses the `TestSuite` class to run the tests. The tests are defined in the `suite` variable.

    2. The second part of the code is the updated code that uses the `TestSuite` class to run the tests. The tests are defined in the `suite_with_ref` variable.

    The updated code includes the following changes:

    - The column name for the tests has been changed from 'education' to 'education-num' to match the column in the original code.
    - The 'target' and 'preds' columns have been added to the current and reference dataframes.
    - The 'target' and 'preds' columns have been used in the `TestFeatureValueDrift` test.

    The updated code also includes the following new tests:

    - `TestShareOfDriftedFeatures()`: This test checks the share of features that are drifted.
    - `TestNumberOfDriftedFeatures()`: This test checks the number of features that are drifted.

    The updated code also includes the following new tests:

    - `TestFeatureValueDrift(column_name='education-num')`: This test checks the feature value drift for the 'education-num' column.
    - `TestFeatureValueDrift(column_name='education')`: This test checks the feature value drift for the 'education' column.

    The updated code also includes the following new tests:

    - `TestShareOfDriftedFeatures()`: This test checks the share of features that are drifted.
    - `TestNumberOfDriftedFeatures()`: This test checks the number of features that are drifted.

    The updated code also includes the following new tests:

    - `TestFeatureValueDrift(column_name='education-num')`: This test checks the feature value drift for the '
