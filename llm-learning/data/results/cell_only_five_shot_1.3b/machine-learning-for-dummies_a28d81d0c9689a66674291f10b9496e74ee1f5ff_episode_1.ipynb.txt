    This is a basic structure for a Python project. The project's structure is based on the PEP 8 style guide, which is a popular style guide for Python projects.

    The `root_dir` is the root directory of the project. It contains all the files and directories of the project.

    The `data_dir` directory contains the raw data, processed data, and external data.

    The `notebooks` directory contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and model evaluation.

    The `scripts` directory contains Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and model evaluation.

    The `reports` directory contains the final reports of the project.

    The `models` directory contains the trained models of the project.

    The `images` directory contains the images used in the project.

    The `README.md` file contains information about the project, its structure, and how to use it.
