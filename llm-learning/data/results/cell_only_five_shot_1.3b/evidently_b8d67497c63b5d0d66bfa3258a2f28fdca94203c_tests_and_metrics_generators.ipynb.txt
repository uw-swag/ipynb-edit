The code cells provided are examples of how to use the `TestSuite` class from the `evidently` library to run tests on a set of columns. The `TestSuite` class is used to run a suite of tests on a set of columns. The `generate_column_tests` function is used to generate a list of tests for a specific column. The `TestColumnShareOfNulls` class is a test that checks the share of nulls in a column.

The code cells are divided into three parts:

1. The first part of the code is a call to the `TestSuite` class with the `generate_column_tests` function. This function is used to generate a list of tests for a specific column. The `generate_column_tests` function takes two parameters: the test class to be used and the name of the column to be tested. The test class is a subclass of `evidently.tests.base_test.BaseTest`, and the column name is a string that specifies the column to be tested.

2. The second part of the code is a call to the `TestSuite` class with the `generate_column_tests` function. This function is used to generate a list of tests for a specific column. The `generate_column_tests` function takes two parameters: the test class to be used and the name of the column to be tested. The test class is a subclass of `evidently.tests.base_test.BaseTest`, and the column name is a string that specifies the column to be tested. The `parameters` parameter is used to specify the parameters for the test.

3. The third part of the code is a call to the `TestSuite` class with the `generate_column_tests` function. This function is used to generate a list of tests for a specific column. The `generate_column_tests` function takes two parameters: the test class to be used and the name of the column to be tested. The test class is a subclass of `evidently.tests.base_test.BaseTest`, and the column name is a string that specifies the column to be tested. The `parameters` parameter is used to specify the parameters for the test. The `columns` parameter is used to specify the columns to be tested.
