    The `ReplayMemory` class is a simple implementation of a memory buffer that can store and replay experiences. The class is used in the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm to train the agent.

    The `sample_memories` function is used to sample experiences from the replay memory. It randomly selects a batch of experiences from the memory.

    The `combine_observations_multichannel` and `combine_observations_singlechannel` functions are used to preprocess the observations. The `preprocess_observation` function is a placeholder for the actual preprocessing function that is used to preprocess the observations.

    The `n_observations_per_state` variable is used to define the number of previous observations to consider for each state.

    The `preprocessed_observations` deque is used to store the preprocessed observations.

    The `env.reset()` function is used to reset the environment and get the initial observation.

    The loop in the code is used to simulate the environment and get the preprocessed observations.

    The preprocessed observations are stored in the `preprocessed_observations` deque.

    The `sample_memories` function is used to sample experiences from the replay memory.

    The `combine_observations_multichannel` and `combine_observations_singlechannel` functions are used to combine the observations.

    The `env.step()` function is used to get the next observation and reward from the environment.

    The preprocessed observations are stored in the `preprocessed_observations` deque.
