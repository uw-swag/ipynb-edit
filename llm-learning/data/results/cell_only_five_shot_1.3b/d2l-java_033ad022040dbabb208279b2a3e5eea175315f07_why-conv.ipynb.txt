```python
    # import necessary libraries
    import os
    import nbformat as nbf
    from nbconvert.preprocessors import ExecutePreprocessor

    # get all notebooks in the current directory
    notebooks = [f for f in os.listdir('.') if f.endswith('.ipynb')]

    # loop over all notebooks
    for notebook in notebooks:
        # load the notebook
        with open(notebook, 'r') as f:
            nb = nbf.read(f, as_version=4)

        # initialize the notebook preprocessor
        ep = ExecutePreprocessor(timeout=-1, kernel_name='python3')

        # execute the notebook
        try:
            ep.preprocess(nb)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Failed to execute {notebook}")
            print(str(e))

        # write the notebook back to disk
        with open(notebook, 'w') as f:
            nbf.write(nb, f)
    ```

    This script will execute all notebooks in the current directory. If a notebook fails to execute, it will print the error message and continue with the next notebook.

    Please note that this script assumes that you have the `nbconvert` and `nbformat` Python libraries installed. If you don't, you can install them using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install nbconvert nbformat
    ```

    Also, this script will overwrite the original notebooks with the executed notebooks. If you want to keep the original notebooks, you can create a copy of the notebook before executing it.
