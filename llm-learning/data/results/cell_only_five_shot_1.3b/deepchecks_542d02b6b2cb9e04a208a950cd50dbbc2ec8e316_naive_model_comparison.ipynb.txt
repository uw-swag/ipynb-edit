```python
    # Import necessary libraries
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

    # Load the dataset
    df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

    # Split the data into features and target variable
    X = df.drop('target', axis=1)
    y = df['target']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Create a Naive model
    naive_model = LinearRegression()
    naive_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions on the testing set
    y_pred = naive_model.predict(X_test)

    # Calculate the mean squared error of the predictions
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

    # Print the mean squared error
    print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')

    # Add a condition to compare the model with a naive model
    if mse < threshold:
        print('The model is better than the naive model.')
    else:
        print('The model is not better than the naive model.')
    ```

    This code first loads a dataset, then splits it into a training set and a testing set. It then creates a naive model and fits it to the training data. It then makes predictions on the testing set and calculates the mean squared error of these predictions. If the mean squared error is less than a certain threshold, it prints that the model is better than the naive model. Otherwise, it prints that the model is not better than the naive model.
