    It seems like you're trying to add a Maven repository for a sequence-to-sequence learning library in your Maven configuration. However, your code is not formatted correctly. Here's a corrected version of your Maven configuration:

    ```
    %mavenRepo snapshots https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/

    %maven ai.djl:api:0.11.0-SNAPSHOT
    %maven org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.26
    %maven org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:1.7.26

    %maven ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-engine:0.11.0-SNAPSHOT
    %maven ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-native-auto:1.7.0-backport
    ```

    This configuration will add the specified Maven repositories to your Maven configuration. The first line is for the snapshot repository, which is used for testing and development. The next lines are for the production repository, which is used for the actual deployment of the library.

    Please note that the version numbers in the `%maven` directives should be replaced with the actual versions of the libraries you're using.
