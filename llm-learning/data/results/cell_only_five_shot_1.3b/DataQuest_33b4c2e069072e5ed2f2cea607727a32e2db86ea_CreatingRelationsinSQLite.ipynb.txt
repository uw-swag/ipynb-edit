The code you provided is a part of a larger code for a working with data sources course. It's a SQLite database management system, and it includes creating a table, inserting data, querying data, and dropping and renaming tables. 

However, the code you provided is not complete. It seems to be missing the part where it creates a table for movies and actors, and a table to link movies and actors. 

Here's the complete code:

```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

conn = sqlite3.connect('nominations.db')

# ... rest of the code ...

create_movies_table = '''CREATE TABLE movies
    (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    movie TEXT);'''

create_actors_table = '''CREATE TABLE actors
    (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    actor TEXT);'''

create_movies_actors_table = '''CREATE TABLE movies_actors
    (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    movie_id INTEGER REFERENCES movies(id),
    actor_id INTEGER REFERENCES actors(id));'''

conn.execute(create_movies_table)
conn.execute(create_actors_table)
conn.execute(create_movies_actors_table)
conn.close()
```

This code will create three tables: movies, actors, and movies_actors. The movies_actors table will link movies and actors together.
