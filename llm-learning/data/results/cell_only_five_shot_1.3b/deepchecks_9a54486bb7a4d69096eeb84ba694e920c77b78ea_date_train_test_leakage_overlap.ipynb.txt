```python
    from deepchecks.checks.methodology import DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap
    from deepchecks.base import Dataset, Suite
    from datetime import datetime
    import pandas as pd

    def dataset_from_dict(d: dict, datetime_name: str = None) -> Dataset:
        dataframe = pd.DataFrame(data=d)
        return Dataset(dataframe, datetime_name=datetime_name)

    # Create a dataset
    d = {'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'B': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'C': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'D': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}
    dataset = dataset_from_dict(d)

    # Create a suite
    suite = Suite(datasets=[dataset])

    # Add a check
    suite.add_check(DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap())

    # Run the suite
    result = suite.run()

    # Print the result
    print(result)
    ```

    The above code creates a dataset from a dictionary, then creates a suite with the dataset. It then adds a check to the suite, which is a method that detects if there is any leakage in the train-test overlap. The suite is then run, and the result is printed.

    Please note that the `DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap` check is not included in the DeepChecks library. You would need to implement this check yourself or find a third-party library that provides it.
