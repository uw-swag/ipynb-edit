    The code you provided is a comprehensive example of how to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification on the MNIST dataset. 

    The code first loads the MNIST dataset, reshapes the data, normalizes it, and then builds a CNN model with two convolutional layers, a max pooling layer, and two dense layers. The model is then compiled with the Adam optimizer and the categorical cross-entropy loss function. The model is trained for 12 epochs, and finally, the test accuracy is evaluated.

    The code is also applicable to the case of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the SimpleRNN layer. The code for this case is also provided, but it's important to note that the RNN model in the previous code is a simple implementation and may not achieve the same performance as the CNN.

    The code also includes a simple example of how to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the Keras library, which is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.

    The code is also applicable to the case of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the LSTM layer. The code for this case is also provided, but it's important to note that the RNN model in the previous code is a simple implementation and may not achieve the same performance as the CNN.

    The code also includes a simple example of how to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the Theano library, which is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently.

    The code is also applicable to the case of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the GRU layer. The code for this case is also provided, but it's important to note that the RNN model in the previous code is a simple implementation and may not achieve the same performance as the CNN.

    The code also includes a simple example of how to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the TensorFlow library, which is a powerful open-source library for machine learning and numerical computation.

    The code is also applicable to the case of a Recurrent Neural Network (
