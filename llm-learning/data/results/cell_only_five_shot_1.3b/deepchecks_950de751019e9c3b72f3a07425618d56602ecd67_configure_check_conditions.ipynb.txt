    Here is the updated code with the addition of book information.

    ```python
    # Adding book information
    book_info = {
        "title": "Book Title",
        "author": "Book Author",
        "publisher": "Book Publisher",
        "year": "Book Year",
        "isbn": "Book ISBN",
        "pages": "Number of Pages",
        "language": "Book Language",
        "edition": "Edition",
        "ISBN_10": "ISBN-10",
        "ISBN_13": "ISBN-13",
        "category": "Book Category",
        "rating": "Book Rating",
        "reviews": "Number of Reviews",
        "description": "Book Description"
    }

    # Adding book information to the notebook
    for key, value in book_info.items():
        if key in notebook_cells:
            notebook_cells[key] = value
    ```

    This code will add the book information to the notebook cells. Please replace the placeholders with the actual book information.
