    The code you've provided is used to create a KDE plot using the seaborn library in Python. The KDE plot is a type of kernel density estimate plot, which is a graphical representation of the estimated density of a random variable.

    The KDE plot is a good way to visualize the distribution of data and to see the shape of the distribution. It's particularly useful for comparing the distribution of two or more datasets.

    The code first imports the necessary libraries and loads the data. It then creates two subsets: one for full-time jobs (FT) and one for part-time jobs (PT). The KDE plot is then created for each subset, with the density of the 'TotalPay' column for each subset.

    The x-axis of the KDE plot represents the 'TotalPay' column, and the y-axis represents the density of the data. The plot also includes a legend to indicate which subset the data corresponds to.

    The code also includes some matplotlib and seaborn configuration settings to make the plots more readable and to improve the layout of the plot.

    The final line of the code is a placeholder for the code that will be executed when the notebook is run.
