```python
    import kernda_pipelines as kdp

    # Clear the KFP cache
    kdp.clear_cache()

    # Now, you can re-run your pipeline with the updated code
    pipeline = kdp.Pipeline(...)
    pipeline.run()
    ```

    This code will clear the KFP cache and re-run your pipeline. The `kernda_pipelines` library is a high-level interface to run KFP pipelines.

    Please note that the `kernda_pipelines` library is not officially supported by Kernda and may not work with all Kernda products.

    Also, the `kernda_pipelines` library is not maintained anymore, and it's recommended to use the official KFP library for new development.

    If you're using a Kernda product that doesn't support KFP, you may need to use the `kernda_airflow` library, which is a more low-level interface to run Kernda pipelines.

    Please note that the `kernda_airflow` library is not officially supported by Kernda and may not work with all Kernda products.

    Also, the `kernda_airflow` library is not maintained anymore, and it's recommended to use the official Kernda Airflow library for new development.

    If you're using a Kernda product that doesn't support Airflow, you may need to use the `kernda_pipelines` library, which is a more low-level interface to run Kernda pipelines.
