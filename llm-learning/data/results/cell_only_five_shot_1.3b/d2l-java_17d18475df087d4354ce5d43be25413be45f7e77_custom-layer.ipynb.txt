    The code you provided is a Maven configuration for a Java project. It uses the `ai.djl` library, which is a deep learning library for Java. The `MyLinear` class is a custom linear layer in the `ai.djl` library.

    The `MyLinear` class has a constructor that takes two parameters: the number of output units and the number of input units. It also has a `forward` method that performs a forward pass through the layer. The `forward` method uses the weights and biases of the layer to perform the linear transformation and activation function.

    The `MyLinear` class also has a `linear` method that performs a linear transformation, and a `relu` method that performs a ReLU activation function.

    The `getOutputShapes` method is overridden to return the output shape of the layer.

    The `MyLinear` class is defined in a file named `MyLinear.java`.

    The commit message "bump of D2L Java book version to 0.8.0 (#58)" indicates that the version of the `ai.djl` library has been bumped to 0.8.0. The number after the hash symbol (#) is the commit number.

    The Maven configuration is used to manage dependencies for the project. The `%maven` directives are used to specify the Maven repository, group ID, artifact ID, and version of the dependencies.
