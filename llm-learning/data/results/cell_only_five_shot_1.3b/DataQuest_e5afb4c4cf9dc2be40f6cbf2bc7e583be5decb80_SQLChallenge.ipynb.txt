    # Suppose we have a database named 'business' with a table named 'sales' with the following columns:
    # 'id', 'product', 'quantity', 'price', 'date'

    # 1. Write a SQL query to select all records from the 'sales' table.
    SELECT * FROM sales;

    # 2. Write a SQL query to select all records from the 'sales' table where the 'product' is 'Apple'.
    SELECT * FROM sales WHERE product = 'Apple';

    # 3. Write a SQL query to select the 'product', 'quantity', and 'price' from the 'sales' table where the 'quantity' is greater than 100.
    SELECT product, quantity, price FROM sales WHERE quantity > 100;

    # 4. Write a SQL query to select the 'product', 'quantity', and 'price' from the 'sales' table where the 'price' is less than 1000 and the 'product' is 'Apple'.
    SELECT product, quantity, price FROM sales WHERE price < 1000 AND product = 'Apple';

    # 5. Write a SQL query to select the 'product', 'quantity', and 'price' from the 'sales' table where the 'quantity' is greater than 100 and the 'price' is less than 1000.
    SELECT product, quantity, price FROM sales WHERE quantity > 100 AND price < 1000;

    # 6. Write a SQL query to select the 'product', 'quantity', and 'price' from the 'sales' table where the 'quantity' is greater than 100 or the 'price' is less than 1000.
    SELECT product, quantity, price FROM sales WHERE quantity > 100 OR price < 1000;

    # 7. Write a SQL query to select the 'product', 'quantity', and 'price' from the 'sales' table where the 'quantity' is greater than 100 and the 'price' is less than 1000, and the 'product' is 'Apple'.
    SELECT product, quantity, price FROM sales WHERE quantity > 100 AND price < 10
