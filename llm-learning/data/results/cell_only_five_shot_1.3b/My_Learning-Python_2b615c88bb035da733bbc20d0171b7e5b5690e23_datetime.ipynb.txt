    ### Response:
    The function `upload_blob` is added to upload a file to a Google Cloud Storage bucket. The function takes three parameters: the name of the bucket, the local path to the file, and the name of the object in the bucket where the file should be uploaded.

    Here is the updated code:

    ```python
    from google.cloud import storage

    def upload_blob(bucket_name, source_file_name, destination_blob_name):
        """Uploads a file to the bucket."""
        storage_client = storage.
