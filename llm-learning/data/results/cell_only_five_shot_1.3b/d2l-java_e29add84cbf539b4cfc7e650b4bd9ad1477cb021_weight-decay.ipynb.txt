    The provided code is a part of a machine learning model for a regression problem. The model is a simple linear regression model, which is a common model for regression problems. The model is trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization algorithm.

    The code contains two methods, `train` and `train_djl`, which are used to train the model. The `train` method uses the default parameters and the L2 penalty, while the `train_djl` method uses a custom optimizer and a custom loss function.

    The code also includes a few parameters, such as the number of epochs, the learning rate, and the regularization parameter for the L2 penalty. The model's parameters are stored in a list, and the loss values for each epoch are also stored in separate lists.

    The `train` method also includes a loop that iterates over the training data and updates the model's parameters using the gradient of the loss function. The loss function is the sum of the squared loss and the L2 penalty, with the L2 penalty being multiplied by a regularization parameter.

    The `train_djl` method also includes a similar loop, but it uses a custom optimizer and loss function. The optimizer is a variant of SGD, with a learning rate tracker. The loss function is a custom loss function that includes a regularization term.

    The code also includes a few print statements to print the L1 norm of the model's parameters, which is the L1 norm of the weights.

    The build time of the model can be reduced by reducing the number of epochs, the learning rate, and the regularization parameter. The regularization parameter can be tuned to improve the model's performance.
