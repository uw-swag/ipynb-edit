```python
    # This is an example of a test suite in Jupyter notebook.
    # The test suite is used to verify the correctness of the code.

    import unittest

    class TestMyFunction(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_addition(self):
            self.assertEqual(add(1, 2), 3)

        def test_subtraction(self):
            self.assertEqual(subtract(5, 2), 3)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()
    ```
    This test suite checks if the `add` and `subtract` functions in the `my_module` module are working correctly. If the functions are not working as expected, the test will fail.

    Please replace `add` and `subtract` with the actual functions you want to test.

    Also, make sure to run the test suite before committing your changes. You can do this by executing the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    jupyter nbtest
    ```

    This command will run all the test cases in the notebook and display the results.

    If you have any questions or need further help, feel free to ask.
