```python
    import tensorflow as tf

    with tf.variable_scope('loss'):
        # Compute mean cross entropy loss for each output.
        Y_true_flat = tf.reshape(tf.concat(values=Y, axis=1), [-1])
        # logits are [batch_size x timesteps, n_chars] and
        # Y_true_flat are [batch_size x timesteps]
        loss = tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits, Y_true_flat)
        # Compute the mean over our `batch_size` x `timesteps` number of observations
        mean_loss = tf.reduce_mean(loss)
    ```

    The code above is a TensorFlow code snippet that computes the mean cross entropy loss for a set of outputs. The loss is computed by taking the softmax of the logits and then taking the cross entropy loss between the true labels and the softmax of the logits. The mean loss is then computed over the batch size and the number of timesteps.
