    ### Explanation:
    The code is refactored to improve readability and to avoid potential errors.
    The variable names are changed to be more descriptive and to follow Python's naming conventions.
    The code is also fixed to ensure that the dimensions of the tensors are correctly calculated.
    The code is also refactored to avoid potential errors.
