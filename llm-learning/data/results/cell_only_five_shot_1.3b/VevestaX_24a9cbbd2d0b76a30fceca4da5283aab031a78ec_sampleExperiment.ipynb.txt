The code you provided is a Python script using the VEVesta library, a tool for data science and machine learning. The script reads a CSV file, extracts some features, performs some feature engineering, and then tracks the variables used for modelling. The script then dumps the datasourcing, features engineered, the variables tracked, and the messages, all in an Excel file.

The code is not redundant as it follows a typical workflow for data science projects. However, if you want to remove the unnecessary files, you can do so by deleting the lines that create and write to the Excel file. Here's how you can do it:

```python
# Dump the datasourcing, features engineered and the variables tracked in a xlsx file
V.dump(techniqueUsed='XGBoost',filename="vevestaDump.xlsx",message="no values",version=1)

# Delete the lines to write to the Excel file
del V.datasourcing
del V.fe
del V.start
del V.end
del V.dump
```

This will remove the lines that create and write to the Excel file. However, please note that this will not delete the data in the Excel file, it will just remove the references to the data. If you want to delete the data in the Excel file, you will need to do that manually.
