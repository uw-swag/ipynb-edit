```python
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
    from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

    # Load the dataset
    df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

    # Define features and target
    X = df.drop('target_column', axis=1)
    y = df['target_column']

    # Split the dataset into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Create a Random Forest Classifier
    clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

    # Train the classifier
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the classifier
    print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
    print('Accuracy:', accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))

    # Save the classifier
    joblib.dump(clf, 'classifier.pkl')
    ```
    This code will create a classification model using the Random Forest algorithm. The model is trained on a dataset, and then it is evaluated and saved.

    Please replace 'your_dataset.csv' and 'target_column' with your actual dataset and target column.

    Also, you need to install the necessary libraries (pandas, sklearn, joblib) if you haven't done so. You can install them using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas sklearn joblib
    ```

    This is a basic example of a classification model. Depending on your specific problem, you may need to adjust the code.
