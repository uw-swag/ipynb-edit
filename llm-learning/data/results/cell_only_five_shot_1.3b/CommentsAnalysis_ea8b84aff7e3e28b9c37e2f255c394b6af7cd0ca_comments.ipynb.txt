The provided code is a mix of Python and Jupyter notebook code, with a lot of comments and variable names. It's a machine learning pipeline for text classification, with a focus on emoji removal and comment cleaning.

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. The `is_with_emoji` function checks if a comment contains any emojis.
2. The `clear_comments` function is a text preprocessing function that cleans the comments. It can handle different preprocessing steps, such as converting to lowercase, removing stop words, stemming, lemmatization, and removing specific words.
3. The `cross_val_score` function is used to evaluate the performance of a model on a cross-validation set.
4. The `CountVectorizer` is used to convert the cleaned comments into a format that can be used by a machine learning model.
5. The `linear_model` from `sklearn` is used to train a logistic regression model.
6. The model's coefficients are printed, and the index of the smallest coefficient is found.
7. The `CountVectorizer` is used to transform the cleaned comments into a format that can be used by a machine learning model.
8. The `cross_val_score` function is used to evaluate the performance of a model on a cross-validation set.
9. The `linear_model` from `sklearn` is used to train a logistic regression model.
10. The model's coefficients are printed, and the index of the smallest coefficient is found.

Please note that the code is quite long and complex, and it's not clear what the purpose of the code is. It's a mix of Python and Jupyter notebook code, with a lot of comments and variable names.
