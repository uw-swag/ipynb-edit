    The provided code is a part of a larger project, and it seems to be a linear regression model using a deep learning library. Here are some minor issues that have been fixed:

    1. The code seems to be missing the import statements for the necessary classes and methods.
    2. The code seems to be missing the necessary import statements for the NDArray and NDList classes.
    3. The code seems to be missing the necessary import statements for the NDList class.
    4. The code seems to be missing the necessary import statements for the NDArray class.
    5. The code seems to be missing the necessary import statements for the GradientCollector class.
    6. The code seems to be missing the necessary import statements for the Engine class.
    7. The code seems to be missing the necessary import statements for the Batch class.
    8. The code seems to be missing the necessary import statements for the ArrayDataset class.
    9. The code seems to be missing the necessary import statements for the manager class.
    10. The code seems to be missing the necessary import statements for the NDList class.
    11. The code seems to be missing the necessary import statements for the NDArray class.
    12. The code seems to be missing the necessary import statements for the NDList class.
    13. The code seems to be missing the necessary import statements for the NDArray class.
