```python
    import os
    import json
    materials_in = []
    input_folder = "materials_list"
    for file in os.listdir(input_folder):
        with open(f"{input_folder}/{file}", "r") as f:
            data = f.read()
            materials_in.append(json.loads(data))

    # Now materials_in is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a material
    # You can now use the materials_in list to perform any operations you need
    ```
