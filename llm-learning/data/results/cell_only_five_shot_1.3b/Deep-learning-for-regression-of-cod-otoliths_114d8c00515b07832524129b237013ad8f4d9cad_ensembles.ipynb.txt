    The provided code is a part of an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on clustering. The EDA is performed on different combinations of CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) and the best model is selected based on the accuracy and mean squared error.

    The code is iterating over different combinations of CNNs and calculating the accuracy and mean squared error for each combination. The best model is selected based on the highest accuracy and mean squared error.

    The final results are printed out at the end of the code.

    The code is not providing any final results, as the EDA is not complete. The final results would be the best model selected based on the accuracy and mean squared error, and the best combination of CNNs.
