    # 14.3 The Dataset for Pretraining Word Embedding
    # 
    # This section describes the dataset used for pretraining word embeddings.
    # The dataset is a subset of the Stanford CoreNLP's WordAnnotatedSentenceCorpus.
    # The dataset is used to train the word embeddings.
    #
    # The dataset is divided into two parts:
    # 1. A training set, which is used to train the word embeddings.
    # 2. A validation set, which is used to tune the hyperparameters of the word embeddings.
    #
    # The training set is a subset of the original Stanford CoreNLP's WordAnnotatedSentenceCorpus.
    # The validation set is a subset of the original Stanford CoreNLP's WordAnnotatedSentenceCorpus.
    #
    # The dataset is available at the following link:
    # https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-corenlp-full-2018-10-05.zip
    #
    # The dataset is not included in this repository. You need to download it manually and unzip it before using it.
