```python
    batch_xs = sess.run(batch)
    # We get batch_size at a time, so 100
    print(batch_xs.shape)
    # The datatype is float32 since what is what we use in the tensorflow graph
    # And the max value still has the original image range from 0-255
    print(batch_xs.dtype, np.max(batch_xs.dtype))
    # So to plot it, we'll need to divide by 255.
    plt.imshow(batch_xs[0] / 255.0)
    ```
