The code you provided is deleting the notebooks and creating a suite of checks for a classification dataset in the iris dataset. The suite is then saved as an HTML file. After that, the HTML file is removed.

The code is written in Python and it uses the Deepchecks library, which is a library for data quality checks in machine learning pipelines. The Deepchecks library provides a suite of checks for tabular data, including checks for missing values, outliers, and more.

The notebooks are created using the Jupyter notebook format, which is a web-based interactive computational environment for Python. They are written in a markdown-like language and can be run, saved, and shared.

The code is deleting the notebooks because the notebooks are not needed after the checks are done. The notebooks are only used to visualize the results of the checks.

The code is also using the Deepchecks library to create a suite of checks for the iris dataset. The suite is then saved as an HTML file. The HTML file is then removed.
