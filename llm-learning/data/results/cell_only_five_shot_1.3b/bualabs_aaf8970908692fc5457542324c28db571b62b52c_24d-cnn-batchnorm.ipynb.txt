    ### Response:
    Here are the equations for the BatchNorm paper:

    1. For the first term, the equation is:

    E[X^2] = E[X^2] + E[X]^2

    2. For the second term, the equation is:

    E[X] = E[X] / sqrt(E[X^2] + ε)

    3. For the third term, the equation is:

    E[X] = E[X] - E[X] * sqrt(2 / n) * ε

    4. For the fourth term, the equation is:

    E[X] = E[X] + sqrt(2 / n) * ε

    where n is the number of samples.

    Please note that these equations are for the batch normalization layer in deep learning models.
