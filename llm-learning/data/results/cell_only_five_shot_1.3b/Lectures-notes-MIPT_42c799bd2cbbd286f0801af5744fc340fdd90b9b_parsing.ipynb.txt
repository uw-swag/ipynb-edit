    # Data Engineering
    # ----------------
    # This section includes data engineering tasks such as data cleaning, data transformation, data integration, data validation, and data visualization.

    # 1. Data Cleaning
    # ----------------
    # This step involves removing or correcting the errors in the data.

    # 2. Data Transformation
    # ----------------------
    # This step involves converting the data into a format that is more suitable for analysis.

    # 3. Data Integration
    # -------------------
    # This step involves merging data from different sources.

    # 4. Data Validation
    # ------------------
    # This step involves checking the data for errors and inconsistencies.

    # 5. Data Visualization
    # ---------------------
    # This step involves creating visual representations of the data.

    # 6. Feature Engineering
    # -----------------------
    # This step involves creating new features from existing ones.

    # 7. Batch Processing
    # -------------------
    # This step involves processing a large amount of data in batches.

    # 8. Real-time Processing
    # -----------------------
    # This step involves processing data in real-time.

    # 9. Model Training
    # -----------------
    # This step involves training machine learning models.

    # 10. Model Evaluation
    # --------------------
    # This step involves evaluating the performance of the models.

    # 11. Model Deployment
    # --------------------
    # This step involves deploying the models for use in a production environment.

    # 12. Model Monitoring
    # --------------------
    # This step involves monitoring the performance of the models in a production environment.

    # 13. Model Maintenance
    # ---------------------
    # This step involves updating the models as necessary.

    # 14. Model Versioning
    # --------------------
    # This step involves managing different versions of the models.

    # 15. Model Retraining
    # --------------------
    # This step involves retraining the models with new data.
