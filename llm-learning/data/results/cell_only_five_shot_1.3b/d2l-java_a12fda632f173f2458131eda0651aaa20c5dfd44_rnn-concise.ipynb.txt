    # Section 8.6: Concise Implementation of Recurrent Neural Networks (#89)
    # 8.6.1 Introduction
    # Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of deep learning models that are capable of learning from sequences.
    # They are particularly useful for tasks that involve sequential data, such as time series analysis, natural language processing,
    # and more.

    # 8.6.2 Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Components
    # RNNs consist of three main components:
    # 1. Input Layer: The input to the RNN is a sequence of data, which is passed through the input layer.
    # 2. Hidden Layer: The output of the input layer is passed through a hidden layer. The hidden layer is responsible for
    # storing and processing information that is useful for the prediction task.
    # 3. Output Layer: The final output of the RNN is passed through an output layer. The output layer is responsible for
    # providing the final prediction.

    # 8.6.3 RNN Implementation
    # RNNs can be implemented using various methods, such as the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is a type of RNN.
    # LSTMs are particularly good at handling sequential data because they can remember information from previous steps.

    # 8.6.4 RNN Applications
    # RNNs have wide-ranging applications in various fields, such as natural language processing, speech recognition, and more.
    # They are used in tasks like sentiment analysis, translation, and more.

    # 8.6.5 Conclusion
    # RNNs are a powerful tool for handling sequential data, making them a key component of many machine learning models.
    # They are also a good choice for tasks that involve time series data, such as time series forecasting.
