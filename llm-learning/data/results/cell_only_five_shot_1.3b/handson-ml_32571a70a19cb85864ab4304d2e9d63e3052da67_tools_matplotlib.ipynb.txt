    ### Response:
    The code you provided is correct. It imports the necessary libraries, defines the data, creates a simple neural network model, compiles the model, and then fits the model to the data. Finally, it predicts a value and prints the result.

    If you have any specific issues or questions about this code, feel free to ask.
