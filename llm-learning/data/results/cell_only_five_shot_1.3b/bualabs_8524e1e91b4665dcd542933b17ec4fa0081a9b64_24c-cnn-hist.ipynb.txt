```python
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

    # Load your data
    df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

    # Split your data into features and target
    X = df.drop('target_column', axis=1)
    y = df['target_column']

    # Split your data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Now you can initialize your model and train it
    model = YourModel()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Predict on your test set
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate your model

    # Add more code to describe more about the problems you are trying to solve
    # For example, you can describe the nature of your data, the features you are using,
    # the target variable, the problem you are trying to solve, etc.
