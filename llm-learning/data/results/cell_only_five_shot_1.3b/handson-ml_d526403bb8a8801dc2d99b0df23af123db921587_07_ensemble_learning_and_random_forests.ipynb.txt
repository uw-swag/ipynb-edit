    # This is a simple example of how to upgrade a TensorFlow 1.0.0 notebook to TensorFlow 2.0.0.
    # Please note that this is a simplified example and may not work in all cases.

    # Import TensorFlow 1.0.0
    import tensorflow as tf

    # Check TensorFlow version
    print("TensorFlow version: ", tf.__version__)

    # Create a constant
    a = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4], name="a")

    # Create a variable
    b = tf.Variable([5, 6, 7, 8], name="b")

    # Create a session
    sess = tf.Session()

    # Initialize all variables
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())

    # Print the value of a
    print("Value of a: ", sess.run(a))

    # Print the value of b
    print("Value of b: ", sess.run(b))

    # Update the value of b
    sess.run(tf.assign(b, [9, 10, 11, 12]))

    # Print the value of b after update
    print("Value of b after update: ", sess.run(b))

    # Close the session
    sess.close()
