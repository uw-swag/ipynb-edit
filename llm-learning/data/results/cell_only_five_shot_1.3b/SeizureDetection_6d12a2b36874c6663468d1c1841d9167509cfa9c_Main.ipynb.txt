```python
    import numpy as np

    # Assuming df is your DataFrame and it contains some numerical data
    df = np.random.rand(10, 10)

    # Dividing by zero is a common mistake in programming. Here's how you can handle it.
    # We'll use np.nan to represent the division by zero.
    df = np.where(df == 0, np.nan, df / df.sum(axis=1)[:, np.newaxis])

    # Now, df should not contain any division by zero warnings.
    ```
