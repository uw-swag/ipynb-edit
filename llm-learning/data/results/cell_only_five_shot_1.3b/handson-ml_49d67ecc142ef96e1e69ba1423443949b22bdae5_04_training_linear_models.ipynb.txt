The commit message "Replace n_inputs with n_outputs, fixes #125" is a reformatting of the commit message. The original code was:

```python
n_inputs = n_outputs = 10
```

The commit message is now:

```python
n_inputs = n_outputs = 100
```

The commit message is also updated to reflect the issue that the code is fixing. The issue number is #125, which is a placeholder for the actual issue.
