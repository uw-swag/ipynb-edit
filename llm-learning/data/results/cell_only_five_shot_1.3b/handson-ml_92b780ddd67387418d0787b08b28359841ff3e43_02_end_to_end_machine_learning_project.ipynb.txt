    This function fetches the housing data from the provided URL and extracts it to the specified path on your local machine. The function uses the `os` and `tarfile` modules to handle file operations and the `urllib.request` module to download the file.

    Please note that the function assumes that the housing data is available at the specified URL and that the data is stored in a tarball file named "housing.tgz". If these assumptions are not true, the function may not work as expected.
