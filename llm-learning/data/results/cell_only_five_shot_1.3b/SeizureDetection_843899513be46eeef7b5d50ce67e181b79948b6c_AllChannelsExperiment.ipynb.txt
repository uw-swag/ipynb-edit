    Here are the changes I made:

    1. I replaced the `read_and_store_data` function with `readEdf`, which is a function that reads the .edf file and returns a pandas DataFrame.

    2. I removed the unnecessary arguments from the `classificationPerformanceIndexes` function, as these arguments are not used in the provided code.

    3. I removed the unnecessary arguments from the `featureClassificationMethods` function, as these arguments are not used in the provided code.

    4. I removed the unnecessary arguments from the `featureComputation` function, as these arguments are not used in the provided code.

    5. I removed the unnecessary arguments from the `featureNormalization` function, as these arguments are not used in the provided code.

    6. I removed the unnecessary arguments from the `featureSelection` function, as these arguments are not used in the provided code.

    7. I replaced the `oversamplingSMOTE` function with `oversamplingSMOTE(reduced_features.drop('seizure', axis = 1), reduced_features['seizure'], smote_neighbors)`, as the function name is not clear.

    8. I removed the unnecessary arguments from the `splitDataset` function, as these arguments are not used in the provided code.

    9. I removed the unnecessary arguments from the `AllChannelsExperiment` function, as these arguments are not used in the provided code.

    10. I removed the unnecessary arguments from the `CompleteSVM` function, as these arguments are not used in the provided code.

    11. I removed the unnecessary arguments from the `CompleteKNN` function, as these arguments are not used in the provided code.

    12. I removed the unnecessary arguments from the `CompleteNB` function, as these arguments are not used in the provided code.

    13. I removed the unnecessary arguments from the `CompleteDT` function, as these arguments are not used in the provided code.

    14. I removed the unnecessary arguments from the `CompleteRF` function, as these arguments are not used in the provided code.

    15. I removed the unnecessary arguments from the `CompleteLDA` function, as these arguments are not
