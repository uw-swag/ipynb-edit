The code you provided is using the Deep Learning Library (DJL) to train a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model. The version of DJL you're using is 0.13.0, and the commit message indicates that you're upgrading to this version.

The code is using the following libraries:

- DJL: A deep learning library for the JVM.
- TensorFlow Lite: A TensorFlow-based ML framework for mobile and edge devices.
- DJL TensorFlow Lite: A bridge between DJL and TensorFlow Lite.

The code is setting up a model, training it, and then collecting the metrics. The model is a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and the training process is using the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer. The loss function is set to softmax cross entropy loss.

The code is using the `fit` method of the `Trainer` to train the model. The `fit` method is a blocking method that waits for the training to complete.

The code is using the `getMetrics` method of the `Trainer` to get the metrics of the training process. The metrics are then collected in a map.

The code is using the `stream` method of the `Stream` class to collect the metrics from the evaluators.

Please note that the code is written in Java and it uses the DJL library. The DJL library is a deep learning framework for the JVM, and it's not directly compatible with TensorFlow Lite.
