```python
    import wandb

    # Initialize a new run
    wandb.init(project="your_project_name", entity="your_entity_name")

    # Log a parameter (key-value pair)
    wandb.log({"param1": 0.1, "param2": 0.2})

    # Log a metric; metrics can be updated throughout the run
    wandb.log({"loss": 0.15})

    # Log a figure
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot([1, 2, 3])
    wandb.log({"my_graph": ax})

    # Finish the run
    wandb.finish()
    ```

    This code will log parameters, metrics, and figures to your W&B project. You can view these logs in the W&B interface.

    Please replace "your_project_name" and "your_entity_name" with your actual project and entity name.

    Also, make sure you have the W&B CLI installed and properly configured in your environment.

    W&B CLI is a command-line interface for W&B, which allows you to run, manage, and visualize experiments.

    You can install it using pip:
    ```
    pip install wandb
    ```

    And then you can run the code:
    ```
    python your_script.py
    ```

    This will start a new run in W&B, and your code will be logged to it.

    Please note that you need to run this code in a W&B compatible environment (like Jupyter notebook, Google Colab, or a local machine).
