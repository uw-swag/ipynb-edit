    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook. The notebook is used to analyze and visualize data, and it includes several cells. 

    The first cell is a code snippet that imports several necessary libraries and classes from the `evidently` and `pandas` libraries. It also imports a function `column_mapping` from a local file.

    The second cell is a code snippet that creates a `Report` object, which is used to generate a report of column-level metrics. The `Report` object is then run on two datasets: one for reference and one for current data.

    The third cell is a code snippet that creates a `Report` object for a regression task. The `Report` object is run on the same datasets as the previous cell.

    The fourth cell is a code snippet that creates a `Report` object for a classification task. The `Report` object is run on the same datasets as the previous cells.

    The fifth cell is a code snippet that creates a `TestSuite` object, which is used to run a suite of tests on a dataset. The `TestSuite` object is then run on the same datasets as the previous cells.

    The last cell is a code snippet that creates a `TestSuite` object for a dataset-level test. The `TestSuite` object is run on the same datasets as the previous cells.

    The code is divided into several sections, each of which is a cell in the notebook. The sections are:

    - The first section is a code snippet that imports the necessary libraries and classes.
    - The second section is a code snippet that creates a `Report` object and runs it on the reference and current datasets.
    - The third section is a code snippet that creates a `Report` object for a regression task and runs it on the reference and current datasets.
    - The fourth section is a code snippet that creates a `Report` object for a classification task and runs it on the reference and current datasets.
    - The fifth section is a code snippet that creates a `TestSuite` object and runs it on the reference and current datasets.
    - The last section is a code snippet that creates a `
