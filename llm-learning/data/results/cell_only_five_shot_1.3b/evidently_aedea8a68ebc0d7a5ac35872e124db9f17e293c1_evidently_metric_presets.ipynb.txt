```python
    #Dataset for Data Quality and Integrity
    adult_data = datasets.fetch_openml(name='adult', version=2, as_frame='auto')
    adult = adult_data.frame

    adult_ref = adult[~adult.education.isin(['Some-college', 'HS-grad', 'Bachelors'])]
    adult_cur = adult[adult.education.isin(['Some-college', 'HS-grad', 'Bachelors'])]

    adult_cur.iloc[:2000, 3:5] = np.nan
    ```

    The above code is used to fetch the adult dataset from openml and then it is filtered to get the data for education levels that are not 'Some-college', 'HS-grad', or 'Bachelors'. The filtered data is then assigned to `adult_cur`. The last two columns of `adult_cur` are filled with NaN values.

    Please note that the code above is a sample and may not work as expected if the adult dataset is not available in your environment.
