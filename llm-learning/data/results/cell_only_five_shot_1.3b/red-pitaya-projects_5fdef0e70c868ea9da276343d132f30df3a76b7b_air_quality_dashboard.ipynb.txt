```python
    # Update the title of the chart
    plt.title("Room Temperature & Air Quality")
    plt.gcf().autofmt_xdate()
    plt.ticklabel_format(useOffset=False,axis='y')
    plt.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(0.6, 0.9))
    plt.show()
    ```

    The code above is used to update the title of the chart. The title is set to "Room Temperature & Air Quality" and the x-axis and y-axis labels are updated. The function `autofmt_xdate()` is used to format the x-axis tick labels as date-time. The `ticklabel_format()` function is used to remove the offset from the x-axis tick labels. The legend is positioned at the top right corner of the plot.
