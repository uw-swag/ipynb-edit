    The code you provided is divided into several sections, each one representing a different step in the process of training a model for classifying tweets as either 'not spam' or 'spam'. 

    Here's a brief explanation of what each section does:

    1. **Dependencies and data loading**: This section imports necessary libraries and loads the dataset.

    2. **Data preprocessing**: This section cleans the data, converts categorical variables to numerical ones, and standardizes the features.

    3. **PCA and t-SNE visualization**: This section applies PCA and t-SNE to reduce the dimensionality of the data.

    4. **Model training**: This section trains several machine learning models on the preprocessed data. Each model is trained on a different classifier, and the performance of each model is tested on the test set.

    5. **Model testing**: This section evaluates the performance of each model on the test set.

    The final part of the code is a series of print statements that display the performance of each model on the test set.

    The code also includes a function `test_model` that trains a model on the training set and then tests its performance on the test set. This function is used to compare the performance of different models.

    The final part of the code is a series of print statements that display the performance of each model on the test set.
