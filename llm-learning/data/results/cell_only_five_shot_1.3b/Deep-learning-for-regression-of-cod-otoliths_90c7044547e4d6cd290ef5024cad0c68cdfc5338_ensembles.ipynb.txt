The code you've provided is a function that performs a t-test on 10-folds. The function `aggregate_predsV2` is designed to perform a t-test on the accuracy and mean squared error of the predictions for each fold. The function `aggregate_predsV1` is designed to perform a t-test on the accuracy and mean squared error of the predictions for each group.

The t-test is a statistical test that is used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. In this case, the groups are the different folds of the 10-fold cross-validation.

The function `aggregate_predsV2` performs the t-test on the accuracy and mean squared error of the predictions for each fold. The function `aggregate_predsV1` performs the t-test on the accuracy and mean squared error of the predictions for each group.

The t-test is performed by calculating the mean of the predictions for each group, and then comparing the means of the predictions for each group. If the mean of the predictions for a group is significantly different from the mean of the other groups, then the group's predictions are considered significantly different from the other groups' predictions.

The t-test is performed on the accuracy and mean squared error of the predictions for each fold and each group. The t-test is performed on the accuracy and mean squared error of the predictions for each group.
