    ## Comment:
    # Deep Learning prefers reverse mode autodiff rather than forward mode due to several reasons:
    # 1. Efficiency: Reverse mode autodiff is more efficient in terms of memory and computation. It can be used to compute gradients without the need for backpropagation, which is a key requirement in deep learning.
    # 2. Speed: Reverse mode autodiff can be used to compute gradients much faster than forward mode autodiff, which is a significant advantage in deep learning.
    # 3. Compatibility: Reverse mode autodiff is compatible with many deep learning libraries and frameworks, which makes it easier to use and integrate with existing systems.
    # 4. Flexibility: Reverse mode autodiff allows for more flexibility in defining and training models, as it allows for the definition of the computational graph, which is a key feature in deep learning.
    # 5. Control: Reverse mode autodiff provides more control over the computation process, as it allows for the definition of the computational graph and the computation of gradients.
