    ## Project Notes

    This project is about implementing a softmax loss function in TensorFlow. The softmax function is a type of activation function that turns its input into a distribution of probabilities, which are all positive and sum to one. This is often used in the output layer of a neural network model, where the model's output is a probability distribution over a set of possible outcomes.

    The softmax function is implemented in TensorFlow using the `softmax` function, which is a part of the `tensorflow.nn` module. The `softmax` function takes as input a tensor of logits and returns a tensor of the same shape where each element is the probability of the corresponding input.

    The softmax loss function is calculated by taking the negative log of the logits of the true labels, and then summing over all the classes. This is done to ensure that the logits of the true labels are positive and sum to zero, which is a requirement for the softmax function.

    The softmax loss function is then used in the training process of a neural network model. The model's weights are updated in the direction that minimizes the softmax loss function.

    The softmax loss function is a critical component of the training process in neural network models, as it ensures that the model's predictions are valid and reliable.

    The softmax loss function is also a key part of the cross-entropy loss function, which is used in the loss function of a neural network model. The cross-entropy loss function measures the difference between the model's predictions and the true labels, and is used to evaluate the model's performance.
