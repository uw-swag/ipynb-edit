```python
    from scipy.stats import hypergeom

    # define the population size, successes, and size of the sample
    population_size = 1000
    successes = 500
    sample_size = 100

    # create a hypergeom object
    h = hypergeom(population_size, successes, sample_size)

    # calculate the probability of at least one success
    prob = h.pmf(0)

    print(f"The probability of at least one success is: {prob}")
    ```
