```python
    # Crop the output of a cell to make it easier to visualize on GitHub
    from IPython.display import display, HTML

    def crop_output(cell):
        if cell.output_type == 'display_data':
            if 'text/plain' in cell.data:
                text = cell.data['text/plain']
                if len(text) > 1000:
                    text = text[:1000] + '...'
                cell.data['text/plain'] = text
            elif 'text/markdown' in cell.data:
                text = cell.data['text/markdown']
                if len(text) > 1000:
                    text = text[:1000] + '...'
                cell.data['text/markdown'] = text
        return cell

    for cell in notebook.cells:
        display(crop_output(cell))
    ```
    This code will crop the output of a cell to 1000 characters if it's a text cell. If it's a code cell, it will crop the output to 1000 characters if it's a Python code cell.

    Please note that this code will only work if the output of the cell is a text or markdown cell. If the output is an image, audio, or any other type of cell, this code will not work.

    Also, this code will not work if the output of the cell is a rich text cell. If you want to crop the output of a rich text cell, you will need to use a different method.

    Finally, this code will not work if the output of the cell is a display data cell. If you want to crop the output of a display data cell, you will need to use a different method.

    This code is a simple way to crop the output of a cell to 1000 characters. If you want to crop the output of a cell to a different length, you will need to modify the code.
