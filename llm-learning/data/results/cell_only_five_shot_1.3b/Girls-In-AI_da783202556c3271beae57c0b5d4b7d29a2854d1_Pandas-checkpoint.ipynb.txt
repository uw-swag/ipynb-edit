    ### Response:
    Here is how you can update the picture link:

    In the original code, the picture link is not defined. If you want to update the picture link, you can do it by replacing the existing link with the new one.

    For example, if you want to update the picture link to a new image, you can do it like this:

    ```python
    # Assuming you have a variable named 'new_pic_link' with the new link
    # You can replace the existing link in the code like this:
    df['Picture Link'] = new_pic_link
    ```

    If you want to update the picture link based on some condition, you can do it like this:

    ```python
    # Assuming you have a condition in the 'if_condition' variable
    # You can replace the existing link in the code based on the condition like this:
    if if_condition:
        df['Picture Link'] = new_pic_link
    else:
        df['Picture Link'] = existing_link
    ```

    Please replace `new_pic_link` and `if_condition` with your actual values.
