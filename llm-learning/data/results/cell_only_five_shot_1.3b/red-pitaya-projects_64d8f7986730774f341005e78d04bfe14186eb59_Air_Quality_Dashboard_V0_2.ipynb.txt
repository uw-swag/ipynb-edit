    # Move the class demo to another notebook
    # The class demo is currently in the same notebook as the rest of the code.
    # If you want to move it to a different notebook, you can simply import it from the other notebook and use it as you would any other function or class.
    # For example, if the class demo is in a file named "demo.py", you can import it like this:
    # from demo import DemoClass
    # Then, you can use the class like this:
    # demo_instance = DemoClass()
    # demo_instance.do_something()

    # If you want to move it to a different notebook, you can simply rename the notebook and the file it's in.
    # For example, if you want to move the class demo to a notebook named "data_analysis.ipynb", you can rename the notebook and the file it's in.
    # Then, you can run the code in the new notebook as usual.

    # If you want to move the class demo to a different file, you can simply rename the file.
    # For example, if you want to move the class demo to a file named "demo.py", you can rename the file.
    # Then, you can import the class from the new file and use it as you would any other class.
    # For example, if the class demo is in a file named "demo.py", you can import it like this:
