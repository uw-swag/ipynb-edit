    The code you've provided is a Python script that uses the `evidently` library to test the number of columns in a DataFrame. The `DataIntegrityMetrics` is a test that checks if the number of columns in the current data matches the reference data. The `TestNumberOfColumns` is a test that checks if the number of columns in the current data is within a certain range.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The first part of the code imports the necessary libraries and classes.
    - The `DataIntegrityMetrics` class is used to test the number of columns in the current data.
    - The `TestNumberOfColumns` class is a test that checks if the number of columns in the current data is within a certain range.
    - The `Suite` class is used to run the tests.
    - The `run_calculate` method is used to run the tests.
    - The `run_checks` method is used to run the tests and print the results.

    The second part of the code is an example of how to use the `TestSuite` class to run a test. In this case, the test is a `TestNumberOfColumns` that checks if the number of columns in the current data is less than 3.

    The `ColumnMapping` class is used to map the columns in the current data to the columns in the reference data.

    Please note that the `evidently` library is a part of the `evidently` package and is not a standalone library. You need to install it using pip:

    ```
    pip install evidently
    ```

    Also, please note that the `evidently` library is under active development and may not work as expected. It's recommended to use it for basic testing and development purposes.
