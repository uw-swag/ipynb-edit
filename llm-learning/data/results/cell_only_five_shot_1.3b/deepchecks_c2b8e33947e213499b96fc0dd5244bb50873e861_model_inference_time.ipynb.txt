```python
    # Example 1
    # Suppose we have a list of numbers
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    # We can use the built-in function `sum()` to calculate the sum of the numbers
    total = sum(numbers)

    # Print the result
    print(total)

    # Example 2
    # Suppose we have a list of strings
    strings = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

    # We can use the built-in function `len()` to count the number of elements in the list
    count = len(strings)

    # Print the result
    print(count)

    # Example 3
    # Suppose we have a dictionary
    dictionary = {'apple': 1, 'banana': 2, 'cherry': 3}

    # We can use the built-in function `keys()` to get the keys of the dictionary
    keys = dictionary.keys()

    # Print the result
    print(keys)

    # Example 4
    # Suppose we have a list of tuples
    tuples = [(1, 'apple'), (2, 'banana'), (3, 'cherry')]

    # We can use the built-in function `sorted()` to sort the tuples
    sorted_tuples = sorted(tuples)

    # Print the result
    print(sorted_tuples)

    # Example 5
    # Suppose we have a list of lists
    lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

    # We can use the built-in function `max()` to find the maximum element in the list of lists
    max_element = max(lists)

    # Print the result
    print(max_element)
