    ### Response:
    # You can use the following code to download the image files.
    # This code assumes that the image files are located in a directory named 'images'.
    # If the image files are not in the 'images' directory, you can change the path accordingly.

    import urllib.request

    download_url = 'http://example.com/image.jpg'  # replace with your image URL
    file_name = 'image.jpg'  # replace with your desired file name

    urllib.request.urlretrieve(download_url, file_name)

    # Now, you can include the image files in your code.
    # For example, if you have an image in the 'images' directory, you can load it like this:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    plt.imshow(plt.imread('images/' + file_name))
    plt.show()

    # If the image files are not in the 'images' directory, you can change the path accordingly.
    # For example, if you have an image in a subdirectory named 'subdir' in the 'images' directory, you can load it like this:

    plt.imshow(plt.imread('images/subdir/' + file_name))
    plt.show()
