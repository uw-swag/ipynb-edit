```python
    import streamlit as st

    def main():
        st.title("My First Streamlit App")

        st.write("This is a simple app to get started with Streamlit.")

        if st.checkbox("Show me the code"):
            st.code(main)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```
    This is a simple Streamlit app that displays a title, a write function, and a checkbox. If the checkbox is checked, the code for the main function is displayed.

    Please note that you need to have Streamlit installed in your environment. If not, you can install it using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install streamlit
    ```

    After you have installed Streamlit, you can run your app by executing the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    streamlit run your_file.py
    ```

    Replace "your_file.py" with the name of your Python file.

    This is a basic example. Streamlit is a very powerful tool and you can do much more with it.
