    ### Introduction

    Vision is a Python library for building and training deep learning models. It provides a high-level interface for defining and training models, and it also includes a collection of pre-trained models.

    ### Installation

    Vision can be installed using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install vision
    ```

    ### Usage

    Vision provides a high-level interface for defining and training models. Here's a simple example:

    ```python
    from vision import VisionModel

    model = VisionModel(input_shape=(224, 224, 3), num_classes=10)

    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    model.fit(x_train, y_train, validation_data=(x_val, y_val), epochs=10)
    ```
