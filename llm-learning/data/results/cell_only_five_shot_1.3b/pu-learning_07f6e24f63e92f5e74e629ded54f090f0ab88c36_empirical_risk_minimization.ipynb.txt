    # Update the learning bias
    # This is a simple example of how to update the learning bias
    # in a model. In this case, we're updating the learning bias
    # to encourage the model to predict the correct class.

    # Assume we have a binary classification task
    # and we have a model that predicts the class of an input
    # and we want to update the learning bias

    # The learning bias is a measure of how much the model's predictions
    # deviate from the actual labels. In this case, we're updating the learning bias
    # to encourage the model to predict the correct class.

    # The learning bias is usually calculated as the average of the
    # absolute differences between the model's predictions and the actual labels.

    # Here's a simple way to update the learning bias:

    # Calculate the average absolute difference between the model's predictions
    # and the actual labels
    avg_abs_diff = torch.mean(torch.abs(model_preds - labels))

    # Update the learning bias by adding a small constant to the average absolute difference
    learning_bias = avg_abs_diff + constant

    # Now, the model's predictions deviate from the actual labels by the learning bias
    # This encourages the model to predict the correct class

    # The learning bias is a simple way to encourage the model to predict the correct class
    # in a binary classification task
