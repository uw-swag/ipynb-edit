    The code you provided is a Python script that uses the BME680 sensor from the Adafruit library to read data from the sensor and print it out. The script also includes a worker thread that polls the sensor data and prints it out every second.

    The code is well-structured and follows good practices for Python code. However, there are a few areas that could be improved:

    1. The use of global variables is not recommended in this context. Instead, it would be better to pass the sensor object as a parameter to the function that uses it.

    2. The use of the `continue_worker_thread` variable is not clear. It seems to be a boolean that controls the loop in the worker thread. It might be better to rename this to something more descriptive.

    3. The use of the `time.sleep(1)` function is not efficient. It could be replaced with a more efficient method of polling the sensor data.

    4. The use of the `bme680` library is not recommended. It's recommended to use the `sensor_io` library, which provides a more comprehensive API for interacting with the sensor.

    Here's a revised version of your code:

    ```python
    import time
    import sensor_io as sensor

    # Define a worker thread to poll the sensor
    sensor_data_thread = True

    def work(sensor_obj):
        while sensor_data_thread:
            if sensor_obj.get_sensor_data():
                output = '{0:.2f} C,{1:.2f} hPa,{2:.2f} %RH'.format(
                    sensor_obj.data.temperature,
                    sensor_obj.data.pressure,
                    sensor_obj.data.humidity)

                if sensor_obj.data.heat_stable:
                    print('{0},{1} Ohms'.format(
                        output,
                        sensor_obj.data.gas_resistance))

                else:
                    print(output)

            time.sleep(1)

    # Create a sensor object
    sensor_obj = sensor.BME680(sensor.I2C_ADDR_PR
