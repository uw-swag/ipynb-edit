```python
    from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
    from deepchecks.checks.overview import ModelInfo

    clf = AdaBoostClassifier(learning_rate=1.2)
    ModelInfo().run(clf)
    ```

    The code above is a part of a larger codebase and it's not clear what the original code was. However, the code is creating an AdaBoostClassifier model and running a ModelInfo check on it. The ModelInfo check is a DeepChecks check that provides an overview of the model's performance.
