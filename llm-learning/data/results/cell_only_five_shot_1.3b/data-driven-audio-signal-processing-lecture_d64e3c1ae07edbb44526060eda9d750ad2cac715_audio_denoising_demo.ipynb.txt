    The code you've provided is a demonstration of audio denoising using a fully-connected deep network. 

    The `load_example` function is used to load an audio file, add background noise, and perform a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) on the audio. The STFT is then used to extract the frequency components of the audio.

    The `dnn_model` function is a simple fully-connected deep network model. It has two hidden layers with 1024 and 1024 neurons respectively. The output layer has 129 neurons.

    The `cnn_model` function is a convolutional neural network model. It has several convolutional layers, batch normalization, and pooling layers. The output layer has 129 neurons.

    The model is compiled with the mean squared error loss function and the Adam optimizer. The model is trained for 200 epochs on the training data.

    The `load_example` function is used to load a test audio file, perform the same preprocessing steps as the training data, and use the trained model to reconstruct the audio.

    The code is not complete and there are some missing parts. For example, the model is not saved, the model is not evaluated, and the model is not used for denoising.

    The code also lacks the necessary imports for the TensorFlow and Keras libraries.

    The code also lacks the necessary imports for the SciPy and Librosa libraries.
