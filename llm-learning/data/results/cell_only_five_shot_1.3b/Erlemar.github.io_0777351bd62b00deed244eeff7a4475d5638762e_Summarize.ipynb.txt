    The code you provided is written in Python and it's using a list comprehension to create a matrix of sentences' intersections. However, the output is too long and it's not clear what the purpose of the code is. 

    Here is a simplified version of the code:

    ```python
    sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
    matrix = [[sentences[i] & sentences[j] for j in range(len(sentences))] for i in range(len(sentences))]
    ```

    This code will create a matrix where each element is the intersection of two sentences from the `sentences` list. The `&` operator is used for set intersection in Python.

    If you want to see the matrix in a more readable format, you can use the `pprint` module:

    ```python
    import pprint
    pprint.pprint(matrix)
    ```

    This will print the matrix in a more readable format.

    Please provide more context or clarify what you want to achieve with the code.
