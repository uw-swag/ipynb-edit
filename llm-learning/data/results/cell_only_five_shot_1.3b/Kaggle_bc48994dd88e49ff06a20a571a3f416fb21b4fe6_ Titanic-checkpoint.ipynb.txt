    sns.factorplot('Embarked','Survived', data=train_DF, aspect = 5)
    ```
    The above code is used to create a factor plot for the 'Embarked' variable. The factorplot function from seaborn is used to create a factor plot. The 'Embarked' variable is divided into three categories: 'S', 'C', and 'Q', and the 'Survived' variable is used to create the plot. The 'aspect' parameter is set to 5 to make the plot more readable.
