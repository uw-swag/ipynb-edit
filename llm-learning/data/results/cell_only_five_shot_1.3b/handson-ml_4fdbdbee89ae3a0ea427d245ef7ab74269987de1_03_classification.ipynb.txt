```python
    # Exercise 1
    # Write a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list that contains only the even numbers from the input list.

    def filter_even_numbers(numbers):
        return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]

    # Exercise 2
    # Write a Python function that takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list that contains only the strings that start with the letter 'a' or 'A'.

    def filter_strings_starting_with_a(strings):
        return [string for string in strings if string[0].lower() == 'a']

    # Exercise 3
    # Write a Python function that takes a list of tuples as input and returns a new list that contains only the second element of each tuple.

    def get_second_element_of_tuples(tuples):
        return [t[1] for t in tuples]
    ```
