```python
    import unittest
    from your_module import YourClass

    class TestYourClass(unittest.TestCase):

        def setUp(self):
            self.your_object = YourClass()

        def test_your_method(self):
            result = self.your_object.your_method()
            self.assertEqual(result, expected_result)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()
    ```
    In the above code, replace `YourClass` with the name of the class you're testing, and `your_method` with the name of the method you're testing. Replace `expected_result` with the expected result of the method.

    This code will create a new test case for your class and method, and run it. If the method returns the expected result, the test will pass. If it doesn't, the test will fail.

    The `setUp` method is a special method that is run before every test. It's where you set up any variables or objects that you'll need for your tests.

    The `test_your_method` method is the method you're testing. Replace `your_method` with the name of the method you're testing.

    The `assertEqual` method is used to check if the result of the method call is equal to the expected result. If it is, the test passes. If it's not, the test fails.

    The `if __name__ == '__main__': unittest.main()` line is used to run the tests. If this line is run, it will run all the tests. If it's not, the tests will not run.

    This is a basic example of a unit test. You can add more tests to your code to make it more robust.
