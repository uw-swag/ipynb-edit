    # and you want to save it to a csv file

    # Get the report results
    report_results = get_report_results()

    # Save the results to a csv file
    report_results.to_csv('report_results.csv', index=False)

    # Now, you can find the csv file in your current directory
    # or you can specify a different path
    # For example:
    # report_results.to_csv('/path/to/your/directory/report_results.csv', index=False)

    # The 'index=False' argument is used to prevent pandas from writing row indices into the csv file
    # This is useful if you don't want pandas to write row indices into the csv file
    # If you don't specify this argument, pandas will write row indices as the first column of the csv file
    # For example:
    # report_results.to_csv('/path/to/your/directory/report_results.csv', index=False)
