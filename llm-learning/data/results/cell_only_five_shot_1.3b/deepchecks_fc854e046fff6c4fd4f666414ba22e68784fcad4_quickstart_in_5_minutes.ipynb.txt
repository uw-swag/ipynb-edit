```
    The code you provided is a PyTorch-based implementation of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection system. The issue you're facing is related to the GPU memory allocation.

    The error message you're seeing is a CUDA error, which typically means that the GPU memory is not allocated correctly. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as insufficient GPU memory, incorrect GPU configuration, or issues with the GPU driver.

    Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

    1. Check your GPU memory allocation: Ensure that you have enough GPU memory allocated to your PyTorch process. You can check this by running `nvidia-smi` in your terminal. If you're using a GPU-accelerated Jupyter notebook, you can also check the GPU memory usage in the notebook itself.

    2. Check your GPU configuration: Ensure that your GPU configuration is compatible with the PyTorch version you're using. You can check this by running `nvidia-smi` again and checking the GPU utilization.

    3. Update your GPU driver: If you're using a GPU-accelerated Jupyter notebook, you can update the driver by running `pip install --upgrade nvidia-py3` in your terminal.

    4. Check your code: Look for any parts of your code that might be causing the GPU memory allocation issue. This could be in the loading of the dataset, in the creation of the `VisionData` object, or in the running of the model.

    5. Tune your code: If you're still having issues, you might need to tweak your code to improve the GPU memory allocation. This could involve optimizing your data loading, using a different data loader, or adjusting the batch size.

    If you're still having issues after trying these steps, please provide more information about your environment, such as the type of GPU you're using and the version of PyTorch you're using.

    Please note that the specific solution to this issue may vary depending on the specific error message you're seeing.
