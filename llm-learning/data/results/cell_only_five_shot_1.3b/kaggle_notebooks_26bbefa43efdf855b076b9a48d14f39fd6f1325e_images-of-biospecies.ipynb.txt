    The code you've provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses TensorFlow and Keras to perform image classification on the Stanford Dogs dataset. The notebook includes preprocessing of the images, model training, and evaluation.

    The notebook is divided into three parts:

    1. The first part loads the Stanford Dogs dataset, preprocesses the images, and displays the image shapes and types.

    2. The second part loads a pre-trained model from TensorFlow Hub, trains the model on the preprocessed images, and evaluates the model.

    3. The third part loads a pre-trained model from a local file, trains the model on the preprocessed images, and evaluates the model.

    The notebook also includes a function `premodel` that creates a model with a specified number of layers, optimizer, and number of neurons. The function `cb` is a callback function that is used to save the best model and stop training when the validation loss stops improving.

    The notebook also includes a function `preprocess_and_display` that preprocesses an image, displays the image, and returns the preprocessed image and the label.

    The notebook also includes a function `load_and_preprocess_data` that loads a dataset from a file, preprocesses the images, and returns the preprocessed images and labels.

    The notebook also includes a function `train_and_evaluate_model` that trains a model on a dataset, evaluates the model, and returns the model and the evaluation results.

    The notebook also includes a function `load_and_preprocess_data` that loads a dataset from a file, preprocesses the images, and returns the preprocessed images and labels.
