    The code you provided is a PyTorch-based implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the ColorMNIST dataset. The code is testing the model on the test set and calculating the accuracy of the model.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The code first loads the trained models from a folder.
    - It then loads the results of these models into a pandas DataFrame.
    - The code then appends the test accuracy of each model to a list.
    - Finally, it prints the results of the test accuracy.

    The code uses the PyTorch library for deep learning. The model is a CNN that is trained on the ColorMNIST dataset. The test set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

    The code also uses the lambda function, which is a feature of Python 3. It's a small anonymous function that can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.

    The test function is used to evaluate the model's performance on the test set. It calculates the accuracy of the model by comparing the model's predictions to the actual labels of the test set.

    The code also uses the eval function, which is a built-in Python function that evaluates a string and returns the result.

    The code also uses the os and pkl modules, which are built-in Python modules for interacting with the operating system and handling pickle files.

    The code also uses the model module, which is a custom module that defines a CNN.

    The code also uses the utils module, which is a custom module that contains utility functions for working with data.

    The code also uses the torch and utils modules, which are built-in Python modules for working with the PyTorch library and the utils module.

    The code also uses the pd module, which is a built-in Python module for working with data in pandas format.

    The code also uses the sys module, which is a built-in Python module for interacting with the system.

    The code also uses the os and pkl modules, which are built-in Python modules for interacting with the operating system and handling pickle files.

    The code also uses the model module, which is a custom module that defines
