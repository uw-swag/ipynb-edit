```python
    nh, bs = 100, 512
    n, m = x_train.shape
    c = (y_train.max()+1).numpy()
    loss_func = F.cross_entropy
    run.fit(10, learn)
    run.fit(10, learn)
    ```
    The batch size of 512 is a good starting point for better accuracy. However, it's important to note that the optimal batch size can depend on the specific hardware and the nature of the data.
