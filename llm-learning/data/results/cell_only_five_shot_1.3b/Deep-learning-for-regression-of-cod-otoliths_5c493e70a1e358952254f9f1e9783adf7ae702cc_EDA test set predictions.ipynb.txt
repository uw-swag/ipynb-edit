    ## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Simple Averaging Ensembles

    ### Importing Necessary Libraries
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.ensemble import AverageBagRegressor
    ```

    ### Loading the Dataset
    ```python
    df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')
    ```

    ### Data Understanding
    Understand the structure, quality, and distribution of your data.

    ### Data Preprocessing
    Preprocess the data to make it suitable for the model.

    ### Model Building
    Build the simple averaging ensemble model.

    ### Model Evaluation
    Evaluate the performance of the model.

    ### Model Optimization
    Optimize the model for better performance.

    ### Conclusion
    Summarize the findings and recommendations based on the model's performance.

    ### Visualization
    Visualize the results to make them more understandable.

    ### Recommendations
    Based on the results, provide recommendations for further analysis or model improvement.

    ### Code
    ```python
    # Your code here
    ```
