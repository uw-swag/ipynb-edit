    class GridSearch:
        """
        Exhaustive search over specified parameter values for an estimator

        Parameters
        ----------
        estimator : estimator object
            This is assumed to implement the scikit-learn estimator interface,
            it needs to have a .fit and set_params method

        param_grid : dict
            Dictionary with parameters names (string) as keys and lists of
            parameter settings to try as values

        scorer : callable function
            scorer callable object / function with 
            signature scorer(estimator, X, y)

        cv : int or cross-validation generator (e.g. Kfolds)
            Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy. 
            Possible inputs for cv are:
            - integer, to specify the number of folds in a KFold
            - An object to be used as a cross-validation generator

        fit_params : dict, optional
            Additional parameters to pass to the fit method

        n_jobs : int, default -1
            Number of jobs to run in parallel, if the model already fits
            extremely fast on the data, then specify 1 so that there's no 
            overhead of spawning different processes to do the computation

        verbose : bool, default True
            Whether to print the fitting progress

        pre_dispatch : int, or string, default '2*n_jobs'
            Controls the number of jobs that get dispatched during parallel
            execution. Reducing this number can be useful to avoid an
            explosion of memory consumption when more jobs get dispatched
            than CPUs can process. This parameter can be:
                - None, in which case all the jobs are immediately
                  created and spawned. Use this for lightweight and
                  fast-running jobs, to avoid delays due to on-demand
                  spawning of the jobs
                - An int, giving the exact number of total jobs that are
                  spawned
                - A string, giving an expression as a function
