    The above Maven commands are used to add the necessary dependencies to your Maven project.

    Please note that the versions used in the commands are placeholders. You should replace them with the actual versions that are available in your project.

    Also, the Maven commands are written in Groovy, which is a language that is similar to Java but is also Groovy-based.

    The `%maven` directive is used to add dependencies to your Maven project. The `mavenRepo` directive is used to specify the repository where the dependencies will be downloaded from.

    The `maven` directive is followed by the coordinates of the dependencies. The coordinates are a combination of the group ID, artifact ID, and version.

    The `maven` directive is followed by any additional options or properties. These options or properties are used to configure the behavior of the `maven` directive.
