The "Single Feature Contribution Train Test" check is a method used in the DeepChecks library to evaluate the impact of a single feature on the model's prediction accuracy. This check is particularly useful when you want to understand the impact of a feature on the model's ability to generalize from the training set to the test set.

The "Single Feature Contribution Train Test" check is run on two datasets: `train_dataset` and `test_dataset`. The check calculates the contribution of each feature to the model's prediction accuracy in both the training and test sets.

The results of the check are a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the name of the feature and the contribution of that feature to the model's accuracy. The contribution is a float between 0 and 1, where 0 means the feature has no impact on the model's accuracy, and 1 means the feature has a direct impact on the model's accuracy.

The check returns a DataFrame with the results of the check, sorted by the contribution of the features in descending order.

Here's an example of how to use the check:

```python
from deepchecks.base import Dataset
from deepchecks.checks.methodology import SingleFeatureContributionTrainTest

# Assuming df_train and df_test are your training and testing dataframes

ds_train = Dataset(df_train, label='label')
ds_test = Dataset(df_test, label='label')

# Run the check
result = SingleFeatureContributionTrainTest().run(train_dataset=ds_train, test_dataset=ds_test)

# Print the results
print(result)
```

This will print the results of the check, sorted by the contribution of the features in descending order.
