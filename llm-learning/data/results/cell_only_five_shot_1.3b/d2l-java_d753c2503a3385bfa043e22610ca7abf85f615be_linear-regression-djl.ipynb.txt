    # L2 Loss
    # L2 loss is a measure of how well the model's predictions match the actual values. It is calculated as the average of the squared differences between the model's predictions and the actual values.

    # The formula for L2 loss is:
    # L2_loss = 1/2 * Σ(actual_value - predicted_value)^2

    # In the context of machine learning, L2 loss is used in the loss function of a neural network. The loss function is a measure of how well the model's predictions match the actual values.
