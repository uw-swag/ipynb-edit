    The code you've provided is not complete and contains several errors. Here's a corrected version:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv("honeyproduction.csv")

# Calculate the sum of colonies by state
top10_states_by_colonies = data[['state','numcol']].groupby('state').sum().sort_values(by='numcol', ascending=False).head(10).reset_index()

# Create a bar plot
plt.figure(figsize=(20,5))
plt.ylabel("Number of Colonies")
sns.barplot(data=top10_states_by_colonies, x='state', y='numcol')
plt.show()
```

This code will load the data, calculate the sum of colonies by state, sort the results in descending order, and then plot the top 10 states with the highest total colonies.

Please replace "honeyproduction.csv" with the actual path to your CSV file.
