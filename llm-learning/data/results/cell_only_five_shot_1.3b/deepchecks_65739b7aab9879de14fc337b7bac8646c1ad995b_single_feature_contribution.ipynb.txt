    ### Explanation:
    The code snippet you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook. The code is used to perform a check on a dataset using the `SingleFeatureContribution` check. The `SingleFeatureContribution` check is a methodology that computes the Pareto-Power-Score (PPS) for a single feature. The PPS is a measure of the contribution of a feature to the overall dataset.

    The code is importing necessary libraries, creating a DataFrame, and then running the `SingleFeatureContribution` check on the DataFrame.

    The `SingleFeatureContribution` check is run with a sample size of 10. The sample size is a parameter that can be adjusted to control the size of the sample used for the PPS calculation.

    The PPS score for each feature is then printed out.

    The PPS score is a measure of the contribution of a feature to the overall dataset. A higher PPS score indicates a higher contribution of the feature to the overall dataset.

    The code is also using the `deepchecks.tabular.base.Dataset` class to create a dataset from the DataFrame.
