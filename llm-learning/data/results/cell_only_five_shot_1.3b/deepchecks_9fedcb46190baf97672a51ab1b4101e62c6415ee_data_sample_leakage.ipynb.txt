```python
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd

    # Create a simple dataframe
    df = pd.DataFrame({
        'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
        'B': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50],
        'C': [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]
    })

    # Create a numpy array from the dataframe
    np_array = df.values

    # Print the numpy array
    print(np_array)

    # Now, if we leak some data from the numpy array to another variable, it will be different
    leak_data = np_array[:, 1:]
    print(leak_data)

    # But the original data remains the same
    print(df.values)

    # This is a common practice in machine learning to avoid data leakage
    # The goal is to ensure that the original data is not used to make predictions
    # The leakage is a way to make the model's predictions depend on the original data
    # This is a form of data leakage
    ```
