    # You can use the `report` function from the `mxnet.gluon.utils.plotting` module to generate HTML reports.

    # Here is an example of how to use it:

    import mxnet.gluon.utils.plotting as plt

    # Assuming you have a list of numbers
    x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    # You can plot it using the `plot` function
    plt.plot(x)

    # Save the plot to a file
    plt.savefig('plot.html')

    # You can also plot multiple series
    y = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    plt.plot(x, y)
    plt.savefig('plot.html')

    # You can also plot a scatter plot
    plt.scatter(x, y)
    plt.savefig('scatter.html')

    # You can also plot a histogram
    plt.hist(x)
    plt.savefig('hist.html')

    # You can also plot a bar chart
    plt.bar(x)
    plt.savefig('bar.html')

    # You can also plot a 3D plot
    plt.plot3d(x)
    plt.savefig('3d.html')

    # You can also plot a contour plot
    plt.contour(x)
    plt.savefig('contour.html')

    # You can also plot a surface plot
    plt.surface(x)
    plt.savefig('surface.html')

    # You can also plot a 2D animation
    plt.animate_2d(x)
    plt.savefig('animation.html')

    # You can also plot a 3D animation
    plt.animate_3d(x)
    plt.savefig('animation.html')

    # You can also plot a heatmap
    plt.heatmap(x)
    plt.savefig('heatmap.html')
