    The notebook you've provided is a comparison of two different versions of a neural network for a sentiment analysis task. The first version is model1, and the second version is model2. The notebook compares the following aspects:

    1. **Model Training**: The notebook trains both models on the SST dataset.

    2. **Model Evaluation**: The notebook evaluates the performance of both models on the test set.

    3. **Feature Comparison**: The notebook compares the features used in both models.

    4. **Output Divergence**: The notebook calculates the output divergence and explanation divergence for both models.

    5. **Correlation**: The notebook calculates the correlation between the output divergence and explanation divergence for both models.

    6. **Plotting**: The notebook plots the output divergence and explanation divergence for both models.

    The notebook is designed to be interactive and allows the user to zoom in and out on the plot, which can be useful for understanding the differences in the models.

    The notebook is also designed to be easily modified to compare different models or different aspects of the models.

    The notebook is also designed to be saved and loaded, which can be useful for comparing different runs of the notebook.

    The notebook is also designed to be run in a Jupyter notebook, which can be useful for sharing the results of the notebook with others.

    The notebook is also designed to be compatible with Python 2 and 3, which is a common requirement for many data analysis projects.

    The notebook is also designed to be compatible with PyTorch, which is a popular deep learning framework.

    The notebook is also designed to be compatible with the SST dataset, which is a sentiment analysis dataset.

    The notebook is also designed to be compatible with the torchtext library, which is a library for natural language processing in PyTorch.

    The notebook is also designed to be compatible with the matplotlib library, which is a plotting library for Python.

    The notebook is also designed to be compatible with the numpy library, which is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices,
