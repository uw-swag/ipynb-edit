    ## Analysis Description

    The analysis of the data provided in the 'test.json' file is conducted on the browser's history. The data is divided into two categories: 'linked' and 'typed'. 

    The 'linked' category represents the number of times a user has clicked on a link in the browser. The 'typed' category represents the number of times a user has typed into the browser.

    The analysis is performed using a 7-day resampling frequency, which means that the data is aggregated over a period of 7 days. The resampling is done to ensure that the data is evenly distributed over the 7-day period.

    The analysis is then plotted using a line graph. The x-axis represents the time period, and the y-axis represents the number of times the user has clicked on a link or typed into the browser.

    The graph shows the number of sites visited weekly, with the x-axis representing the time period and the y-axis representing the number of times the user has clicked on a link or typed into the browser. The color of the line represents the type of action (either clicked on a link or typed into the browser).

    The graph also shows the most frequently visited sites, with the x-axis representing the time period and the y-axis representing the number of times the user has clicked on a link or typed into the browser. The color of the bar represents the site, and the height of the bar represents the number of times the user has visited the site.

    The graph is saved as a PNG image in the current directory.

    The analysis is also performed on a subset of the data, with the 'to_include' list representing the most frequently visited sites. The analysis is done on the 'title' column of the data, and the 'values' list represents the number of times the user has visited each of the sites.
