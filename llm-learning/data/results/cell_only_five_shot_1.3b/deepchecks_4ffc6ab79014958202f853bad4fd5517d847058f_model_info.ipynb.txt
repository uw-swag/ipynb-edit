    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

    # Preprocess the data
    # This step depends on the specifics of your dataset
    # For example, you might need to handle missing values, normalize numerical features, etc.

    # Split the data into features and target
    X = df.drop('target', axis=1)
    y = df['target']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Standardize the features
    sc = StandardScaler()

    # Evaluate the model
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

    # Save the model
    # This step depends on the specifics of your project and what you want to do with the model
    # For example, you might want to save the model to a file, or use it for predictions in a real-world application
