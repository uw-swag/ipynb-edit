The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses matplotlib to animate a line graph of temperature data. The data is read from a CSV file, and the graph updates every 2 seconds.

The code is divided into two parts:

1. The `animate` function, which is called at every animation frame. It collects the current temperature, appends it to a pandas DataFrame, and then updates the graph with the new data.

2. The `FuncAnimation` function, which creates the animation. It calls the `animate` function at every animation frame, and the `interval` parameter specifies the time between frames in milliseconds.

The code also includes a line to clear the output and display a message indicating the number of records collected.

The line `x = df['Date']` selects the 'Date' column from the DataFrame, and `y1 = df['Temperature (oC)']` selects the 'Temperature (oC)' column. The graph is then updated with these data.

Please note that the `xadc_get_value_temp` function is not defined in the provided code. You need to replace it with the actual function that fetches the temperature data from your system.

Also, the code assumes that the temperature data is stored in a CSV file named `temperature data.csv` in the same directory as the notebook. If the file is located elsewhere, you need to adjust the `filename` variable accordingly.
