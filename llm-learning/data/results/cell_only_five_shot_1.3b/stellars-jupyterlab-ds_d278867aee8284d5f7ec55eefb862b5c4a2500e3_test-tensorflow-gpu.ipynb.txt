    # This is a simple example of a Python script that creates a new workspace file.
    # The workspace file is a JSON file that contains the configuration for the workspace.
    # The configuration includes the name of the workspace, the list of notebooks that are part of the workspace,
    # and the list of Python environments that are part of the workspace.

    # CUDA test
    # Here is a simple example of a Python script that uses CUDA to perform a matrix multiplication.
    # This is a basic example and may not be suitable for all use cases.

    import numpy as np

    # Define the dimensions of the matrices
    N = 1000

    # Create two matrices
    A = np.random.rand(N, N).astype(np.float32)
    B = np.random.rand(N, N).astype(np.float32)
    C = np.zeros((N, N)).astype(np.float32)

    # Perform the matrix multiplication
