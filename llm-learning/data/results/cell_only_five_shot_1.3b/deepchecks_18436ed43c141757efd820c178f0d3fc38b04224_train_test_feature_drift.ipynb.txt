    ## Example 1: Ridge Regression

    # Ridge Regression is a technique used in machine learning to reduce the impact of overfitting. It works by penalizing the squared magnitude of the coefficients, which helps to avoid overfitting.

    ### Example 2: Linear Regression

    # Linear Regression is a technique used in machine learning to predict a target variable by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

    ### Example 3: Decision Tree

    # Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm that is mostly used for classification problems. It creates a tree-like model of decisions and their possible outcomes.

    ### Example 4: K-Nearest Neighbors

    # K-Nearest Neighbors is a type of instance-based learning or non-generalizing learning algorithm. It is a type of instance-based learning or non-generalizing learning algorithm.

    ### Example 5: Support Vector Machine

    # Support Vector Machine is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification or regression challenges.

    ### Example 6: Logistic Regression

    # Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm that is used for binary classification problems. It is a type of linear model.

    ### Example 7: K-Means Clustering

    # K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that is used for grouping data points.

    ### Example 8: Naive Bayes

    # Naive Bayes is a family of probabilistic machine learning algorithms based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.

    ### Example 9: Random Forest

    # Random Forest is a supervised machine learning algorithm that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

    ### Example 10: Gradient Boosting

    # Gradient Boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees.
