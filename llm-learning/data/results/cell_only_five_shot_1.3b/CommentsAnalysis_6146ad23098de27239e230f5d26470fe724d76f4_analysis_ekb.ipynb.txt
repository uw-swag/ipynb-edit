    The code you provided is a series of operations on a dataset, including loading a dataset, cleaning it, and then saving it back to a new file. 

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    1. The first part of the code is loading the dataset from two different files: 'comments' and 'users'. These files are pickle files, which are binary files that contain Python objects.

    2. The code then creates a DataFrame from these comments.

    3. The code filters the users to only include those who have a single university and a faculty.

    4. The code counts the number of users for each type of university and faculty.

    5. The code then creates a new DataFrame for users with a single university and faculty.

    6. The code then counts the number of users for each type of education and graduation status.

    7. The code then creates a new DataFrame for users with a single university and faculty, excluding certain personal attributes.

    8. The code then counts the number of users for each type of alcohol use and smoking habit.

    9. The code then creates a new DataFrame for users with a single university and faculty, excluding certain life attributes.

    10. The code then counts the number of users for each type of relation and life main.

    11. The code then creates a new DataFrame for users with a single university and faculty, excluding certain people attributes.

    12. The code then counts the number of users for each type of sex.

    13. The code then creates a new DataFrame for users with a single university and faculty, excluding certain date attributes.

    14. The code then counts the number of users for each type of hour.

    15. The code then creates a new DataFrame for users with a single university and faculty, excluding certain text attributes.

    16. The code then counts the number of users for each type of likes.

    17. The code then creates a new DataFrame for users with a single university and faculty, excluding certain sex attributes.

    18. The code then counts the number of users for each type of is_gum.

    19. The code then creates a new DataFrame for users with
