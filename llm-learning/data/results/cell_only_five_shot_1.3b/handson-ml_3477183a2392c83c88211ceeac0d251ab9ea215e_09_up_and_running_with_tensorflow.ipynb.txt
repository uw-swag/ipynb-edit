    The code you provided is using the TensorBoard extension for Jupyter notebook. TensorBoard is a visualization tool that allows you to track the performance of your machine learning models. It provides a lot of information about the model's performance, such as the learning rate, the number of epochs, the batch size, and more.

    However, the code you provided is not using TensorBoard. Instead, it's using the `show_graph()` function to display the graph of the TensorFlow graph. This function is not recommended for production use as it can lead to performance issues.

    Instead, you should use TensorBoard to visualize your TensorFlow graph. You can do this by running the code in a Jupyter notebook and then opening the TensorBoard URL in your web browser.

    Here's how you can use TensorBoard:

    ```python
    from tensorflow_graph_in_jupyter import show_graph
    show_graph(tf.get_default_graph())
    ```

    This will display the graph of the TensorFlow graph in the Jupyter notebook.
