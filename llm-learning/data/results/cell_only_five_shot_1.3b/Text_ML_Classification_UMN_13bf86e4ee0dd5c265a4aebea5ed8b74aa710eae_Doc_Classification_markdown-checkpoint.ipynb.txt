    ### Response:
    The code you provided is already complete and ready to use. It loads a dataset from a CSV file, splits it into a training set and a test set, and then standardizes the features.

    Here's the code again for reference:

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

    df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

    X = df.drop('target', axis=1)
    y = df['target']

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    sc = StandardScaler()
    X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = sc.transform(X_test)
    ```

    This code assumes that you have a CSV file named 'data.csv' and a column named 'target' in your data. It also assumes that you want to split your data into a training set and a test set with a 20% test size.
