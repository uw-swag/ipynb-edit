The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook component written in the Google Cloud Dataflow (GCP DF) Python SDK. This component is designed to train a custom model on a Cassava dataset using TensorFlow.

The component takes several parameters such as the learning rate (`lr`), the number of epochs (`epochs`), the number of steps per epoch (`steps`), and the distribution strategy (`distribute`). It also takes an `output_model` parameter which is used to store the trained model.

The component first imports necessary libraries and sets up the environment. It then defines a function `preprocess_data` to preprocess the images in the Cassava dataset.

The function `create_dataset` is used to load the Cassava dataset and preprocess the data. It also sets up the `tf.data.Options` to enable auto-sharding.

The `create_model` function is used to create a pretrained ResNet50 model. It also compiles the model with an Adam optimizer and a sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function.

The `custom_train_model` function is the main function of the component. It creates a dataset, builds a model, and trains the model. The trained model is then saved to the specified `model_dir`.

The component also logs the accuracy of the model and the framework it was trained on.

The component is designed to be run in a GCP DF pipeline, and it can be configured to run on a single machine or multiple machines. The `distribute` parameter determines the distribution strategy to use, and it can be 'single', 'mirror', or 'multi'.
