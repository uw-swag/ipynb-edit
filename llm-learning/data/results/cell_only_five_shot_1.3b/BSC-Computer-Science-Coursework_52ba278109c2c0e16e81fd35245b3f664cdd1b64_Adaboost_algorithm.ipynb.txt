```python
    # Importing necessary libraries
    from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer

    # Loading the breast cancer dataset
    data = load_breast_cancer()
    X = data.data
    y = data.target

    # Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Creating a AdaBoost classifier
    ada_clf = AdaBoostClassifier(n_estimators=50, learning_rate=1, random_state=42)

    # Training the classifier
    ada_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Making predictions
    y_pred = ada_clf.predict(X_test)

    # Calculating the accuracy of the classifier
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

    print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
    ```
    This code will train an AdaBoost classifier on the breast cancer dataset, make predictions, and calculate the accuracy of the classifier.

    Please note that this is a simple example and real-world applications may require more complex data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning.
