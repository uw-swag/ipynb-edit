```python
    import pandas as pd
    import psycopg2
    from sqlalchemy import create_engine

    # Connect to your postgres DB
    conn = psycopg2.connect(
        dbname="your_dbname",
        user="your_username",
        password="your_password",
        host="your_host"
    )

    # Create a cursor object
    cur = conn.cursor()

    # Define the list of files you want to upload
    files_to_upload = ['file1.csv', 'file2.csv', 'file3.csv']

    # Loop through each file in the list
    for file in files_to_upload:
        # Create an engine to connect to the database
        engine = create_engine('postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname')

        # Read the file into a pandas DataFrame
        df = pd.read_csv(file)

        # Write the DataFrame to the database
        df.to_sql('table_name', engine, if_exists='append', index=False)

    # Close the cursor and connection
    cur.close()
    conn.close()
    ```
    This script will connect to a PostgreSQL database, read CSV files, and then upload the data into a specified table in the database. The files to upload are defined in the `files_to_upload` list. The `if_exists='append'` argument means that if the table already exists, the new data will be appended to it.
