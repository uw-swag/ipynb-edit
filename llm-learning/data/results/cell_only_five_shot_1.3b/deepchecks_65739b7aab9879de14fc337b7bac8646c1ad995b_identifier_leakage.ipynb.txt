    This is a GitHub action that runs the `links-checks` script on every push to the `master` branch. The action uses the `actions/checkout@v2` action to checkout the code, the `actions/setup-python@v2` action to set up Python, and the `pip` command to install the `links-checks` script and its dependencies. The `codecov/codecov-action@v1` action is used to upload the coverage report to Codecov.
