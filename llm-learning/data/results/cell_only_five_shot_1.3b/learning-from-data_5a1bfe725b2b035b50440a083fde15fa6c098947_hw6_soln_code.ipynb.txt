    # Homework 6:
    # 
    # Write a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list that contains only the even numbers from the original list.
    #
    # For example:
    #
    #    >>> filter_even_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
    #    [2, 4, 6]
    #
    #    >>> filter_even_numbers([1, 3, 5, 7, 9])
    #    []
    #
    #    >>> filter_even_numbers([2, 4, 6, 8, 10])
    #    [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    #
    # Hint: You can use list comprehension to solve this problem.

    def filter_even_numbers(lst):
        # Your code here
        pass
    ```

    ### Solution:

    ```python
    def filter_even_numbers(lst):
        return [num for num in lst if num % 2 == 0]
    ```

    ### Explanation:

    The function `filter_even_numbers` takes a list of integers as input. It uses list comprehension to create a new list that only includes the even numbers from the original list. The condition `num % 2 == 0` is used to check if a number is even. If a number is even, it is included in the new list. If a number is not even, it is not included.

    The function returns the new list.
