    The code you've provided is a comprehensive example of how to use the evidently library to analyze and visualize the performance of a machine learning model. 

    The code first imports necessary libraries and loads the Iris dataset. It then calculates a data drift report, a data and target drift report, a target and data drift report, and a classification performance report.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the profile section to analyze the performance of the model. The profile section calculates the data drift, target drift, and classification performance.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the model selection process to train a K-Nearest Neighbors model on the Iris dataset.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the Dashboard to visualize the performance of the model.
