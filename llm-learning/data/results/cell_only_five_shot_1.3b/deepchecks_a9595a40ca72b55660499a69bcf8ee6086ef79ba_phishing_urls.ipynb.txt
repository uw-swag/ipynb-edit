    ### Response:
    The commit adds a new feature to the code.

    The new feature is a function `Pisces` that filters the dataframe `pdb` based on the Pisces web filter. The `Pisces` function takes two arguments: `seqId` and `resolution`.

    Here is the code after the commit:

    ```python
    from pyspark import SparkConf, SparkContext
    from pyspark.sql.functions import *
    from mmtfPyspark.datasets import groupInteractionExtractor
    from mmtfPyspark.io import MmtfReader
    from mmtfPyspark.webFilters import Pisces
    seqId = 40
    resolution = 2.0

    pdb = pdb.filter(Pisces(seqId, resolution))
    ```

    This code will filter the dataframe `pdb` based on the Pisces web filter, which is a method used to filter the dataframe based on the sequence identifier and resolution.

    The `Pisces` function is a part of the `mmtfPyspark.webFilters` module, which is a part of the `mmtfPyspark` package.

    The `seqId` and `resolution` variables are used to pass the sequence identifier and resolution to the `Pisces` function.

    The `pdb` variable is the dataframe that will
