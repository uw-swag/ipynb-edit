    # PMS5003 Dependency

    The PMS5003 is a gas sensor that measures the concentration of five different types of pollutants:

    - Carbon Monoxide (CO)
    - Nitrogen Dioxide (NO)
    - Ozone (O3)
    - Particulate matter (PM)
    - Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)

    The PMS5003 is a popular choice for environmental monitoring due to its high accuracy and sensitivity. It is often used in conjunction with other sensors to provide a comprehensive view of the air quality.

    ## Dependencies

    - `pyserial`: This is a Python library for serial communication. It is used to communicate with the PMS5003 sensor.

    - `numpy`: This is a Python library for numerical computations. It is used to perform calculations on the sensor data.

    - `matplotlib`: This is a Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is used to visualize the sensor data.

    ## Installation

    You can install the PMS5003 library using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pms5003
    ```

    ## Usage

    Here is a simple example of how to use the PMS5003 library:

    ```python
    import pms5003

    sensor = pms5003.PMS5003()
    sensor.start_measurement()

    while True:
        data = sensor.get_data()
        # Process the sensor data
    ```

    This is a basic example and the actual usage may vary depending on your specific requirements.
