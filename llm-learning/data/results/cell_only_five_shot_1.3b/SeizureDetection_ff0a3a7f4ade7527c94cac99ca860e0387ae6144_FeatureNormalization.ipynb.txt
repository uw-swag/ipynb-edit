```python
    from imblearn.under_sampling import majority_class

    # Load your dataset
    df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

    # Separate features and target
    X = df.drop('target', axis=1)
    y = df['target']

    # Initialize the Majority class undersampling
    undersampling = majority_class(random_state=0)

    # Fit and transform the data
    X_res, y_res = undersampling.fit_resample(X, y)

    # Check the new class distribution
    print(y_res.value_counts())
    ```
    This code will perform majority class undersampling on your dataset. The majority class is the class that appears most frequently in the dataset. The undersampling process will then remove instances from the majority class to balance the dataset.
