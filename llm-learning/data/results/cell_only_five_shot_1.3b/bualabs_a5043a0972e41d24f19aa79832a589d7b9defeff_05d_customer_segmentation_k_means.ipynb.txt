```python
    import bs4 as bs
    import urllib.request

    source = urllib.request.urlopen('http://bualabs.com').read()
    soup = bs.BeautifulSoup(source,'lxml')

    for paragraph in soup.find_all('p'):
        links = paragraph.find_all('a', href=True)
        for link in links:
            print(link['href'])
    ```

    This code will print out the URLs of all the links in the webpage.

    Please note that this code will only work if the website 'bualabs.com' is publicly accessible. If it's not, you'll need to use a different method to get the links.
