    This structure is based on the Zen of Python, which is:

    ```
    "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. There are many ways to do it, but this one is obvious and simple."
    ```

    This structure is also known as the PEP8 style guide, which is a popular style guide for Python code.
