    The code you've provided is a part of a larger process that involves data preprocessing, model training, and testing. Here's a brief overview of what each part does:

    1. The first part reads the data from a CSV file and performs some basic data manipulation and analysis.

    2. The second part defines a function `fit_transform_ohe` that performs one-hot encoding on a specified column. It also returns the transformed column as a pandas Series.

    3. The third part uses the `fit_transform_ohe` function to perform one-hot encoding on the categorical columns in the dataframe.

    4. The fourth part splits the data into a training set and a test set.

    5. The fifth part uses a linear regression model to predict the 'total_count' column in the training set.

    6. The sixth part plots the residuals of the model, which are the differences between the observed and predicted values.

    7. The last part uses statsmodels to build an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model on the training data. It then uses this model to predict the 'total_count' values in the test set.

    Please note that the code you've provided is incomplete and may not work as expected. It's missing some parts, such as the definition of the 'mymodel' variable, the creation of the 'container_image_name' variable, and the definition of the 'ws' variable.
