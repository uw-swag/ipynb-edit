The code you provided is a simple implementation of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm for linear regression. In this code, the learning rate (lr) is set to 0.03 and the number of epochs is set to 3.

The code then iterates over each epoch, and for each epoch, it iterates over each batch of the training dataset. In each batch, it computes the loss (which is the mean squared error between the predicted and actual values) and computes the gradient of the loss with respect to the parameters. It then updates the parameters using the gradient and the learning rate.

The code also computes the loss on the training set after each epoch and prints the loss.

The `linreg` function is a linear regression model that takes as input the features and parameters, and returns the predicted values.

The `squaredLoss` function is a function that computes the squared loss between the predicted and actual values.

The `sgd` function is a function that updates the parameters using the gradient and the learning rate.

The `Batch` class is a custom class that represents a batch of data. It has a method `getData()` that returns the features of the batch, and a method `getLabels()` that returns the labels of the batch.

The `NDArray` class is a generic class for numerical data. It is used to represent arrays of numbers.

The `GradientCollector` class is a utility class that collects gradients. It is used to compute the gradient of a function with respect to a set of parameters.

The `Engine` class is a utility class that provides methods for creating and managing gradients.

The `params` variable is a list of parameters that are updated during the training process.

The `batchSize` variable is the number of examples in each batch.

The `features` and `labels` variables are the features and labels of the training dataset.

The `manager` variable is a dataset manager that is used to get batches of data from the training dataset.

The `Batch` class is used to represent a batch of data, and the `NDArray` class is used to represent numerical data.

The `GradientCollector` class is used to collect gradients, and the `Engine` class is used to create and
