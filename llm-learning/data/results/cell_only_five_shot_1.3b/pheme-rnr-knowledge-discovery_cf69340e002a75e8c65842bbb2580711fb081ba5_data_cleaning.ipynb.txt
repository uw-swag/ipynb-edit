```python
    # Check if the column has only one unique value
    for col in gw.columns:
        if len(gw[col].unique()) == 1:
            # Drop the column
            gw.drop(col, inplace=True, axis = 1)

    # Aggregate tweets by thread
    gw_thrds = agg_tweets_by_thread(gw)
    gw_thrds.columns
    ```

    The code above checks if a column in the DataFrame `gw` has only one unique value. If it does, it drops that column. The `agg_tweets_by_thread` function is a placeholder for the actual function that aggregates tweets by thread.

    The `gw_thrds.columns` line is used to print the columns of the resulting DataFrame.
