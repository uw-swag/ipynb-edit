    ### Explanation:
    The code snippet you provided is a function that generates synthetic data for a classification problem. The function `get_samples` takes an integer `n` as input and returns three arrays: `x`, `y`, and `s`. `x` is a 2D array of shape `(2n, 3)`, where each row is a 3-dimensional point in the 3D space. `y` is a 1D array of length `2n`, where each element is either 1 or 0, representing the class labels for the points in `x`. `s` is a 1D array of length `2n`, where each element is either 0 or 1, representing the labels for the samples in `x`.

    The function uses the `numpy.random.multivariate_normal` function to generate `n` points in the 3D space, with the mean and covariance matrices defined by `MEAN_P` and `COV_P`, respectively, for points labeled as 1, and the mean and covariance matrices defined by `MEAN_N` and `COV_N`, respectively, for points labeled as
