```python
    # Add colab support for d2l-java
    import sys
    sys.path.insert(0, '/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/d2l-java')
    import d2l
    from d2l import torch as d2l
    from torch import nn
    from torch.nn import functional as F

    # Create a simple sequential model
    class MLP(d2l.Module):
        def __init__(self, num_outputs):
            super(MLP, self).__init__()
            self.linear = d2l.Linear(10, num_outputs)

        def forward(self, x):
            return self.linear(x)

    # Create a model instance
    model = MLP(num_outputs=10)

    # Create a dummy input
    x = d2l.ones(10)

    # Forward propagation
    y = model(x)

    # Print the output
    print(y)
    ```

    This code adds colab support for the d2l-java library. It imports the necessary libraries and creates a simple MLP model. The model is then used to create a dummy input and perform forward propagation. The output is then printed.

    Please note that you need to have the d2l-java library installed in your Colab environment. You can install it using pip:

    ```python
    pip install d2l-java
    ```

    Also, please ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the Colab environment.
