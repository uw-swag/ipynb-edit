The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the `evidently` library to detect data drift in a dataset. The notebook is designed to visualize the data drift using a heatmap. The code is divided into two parts:

1. The first part of the code is used to load the data, set the column mapping for the Evidently Profile, and evaluate the data drift with the specified confidence level and threshold.

2. The second part of the code is used to visualize the data drift using a heatmap. The heatmap shows the drifted features and the p-values for each feature.

The code is not complete, as it is missing the part where the data is loaded and the data is visualized. The missing part is the part where the data is loaded and the data is visualized.
