    ## 14.6.1 Introduction

    Subword embeddings are a method of representing words as a combination of smaller subwords. This is done to reduce the vocabulary size and improve the performance of the model.

    ## 14.6.2 Subword Embedding Model

    The subword embedding model is a neural network that takes a word as input and outputs a subword embedding. The subword embedding is a compact representation of the word that captures its semantic meaning.

    The subword embedding model is a sequence-to-sequence model, which means it takes a sequence of words as input and outputs a sequence of subword embeddings.

    ## 14.6.3 Subword Embedding in NLP

    Subword embeddings are used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as text summarization, text generation, and machine translation. They are used to capture the context of words in a sentence, which is crucial for understanding the meaning of the sentence.

    ## 14.6.4 Subword Embedding in Machine Translation

    In machine translation, subword embeddings are used to capture the context of words in a sentence. This is crucial for the translation model to understand the context and translate the sentence correctly.

    ## 14.6.5 Subword Embedding in Text Summarization

    In text summarization, subword embeddings are used to capture the context of words in a sentence. This is crucial for the summarization model to understand the context and extract the important information.

    ## 14.6.6 Subword Embedding in Text Generation

    In text generation, subword embeddings are used to capture the context of words in a sentence. This is crucial for the text generation model to understand the context and generate the text.

    ## 14.6.7 Subword Embedding in Information Extraction

    In information extraction, subword embeddings are used to capture the context of words in a sentence. This is crucial for the information extraction model to understand the context and extract the relevant information.
