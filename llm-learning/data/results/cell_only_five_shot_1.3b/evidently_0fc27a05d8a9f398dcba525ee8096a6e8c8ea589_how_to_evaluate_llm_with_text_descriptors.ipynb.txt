    The code you provided is a part of a larger codebase and it seems like you're trying to fix a semantic similarity issue. However, the code you've provided is not complete and does not provide the full context for the issue you're trying to solve.

    The issue you're trying to solve is related to the index values in the code. The code is using descriptors to measure the semantic similarity between two columns, but the index values are not being correctly set.

    The code you've provided is using the built-in descriptors for the columns "question" and "response". The issue is that the index values are not being correctly set.
