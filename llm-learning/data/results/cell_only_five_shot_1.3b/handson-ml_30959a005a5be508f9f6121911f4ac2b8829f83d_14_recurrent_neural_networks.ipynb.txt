The code you provided is a TensorFlow 2.0 code snippet. The changes you made are:

1. Changed the import statement from `tf.nn.rnn_cell` to `tf.contrib.rnn`. This is because TensorFlow 2.0 has moved the RNN cell implementations to the `tf.contrib.rnn` module.

2. Changed the import statement from `tf.nn.dynamic_rnn` to `tf.nn.dynamic_rnn`. This is because TensorFlow 2.0 has removed the `dynamic_rnn` function and replaced it with `dynamic_rnn`.

3. Changed the import statement from `tf.contrib.seq2seq.embedding_rnn_seq2seq` to `tf.contrib.legacy_seq2seq.embedding_rnn_seq2seq`. This is because TensorFlow 2.0 has moved the seq2seq functions to the `tf.contrib.legacy_seq2seq` module.

4. Changed the import statement from `tf.unstack` to `tf.transpose`. This is because TensorFlow 2.0 has removed the `unstack` function and replaced it with `transpose`.

5. Changed the import statement from `tf.unstack` to `tf.transpose`. This is because TensorFlow 2.0 has removed the `unstack` function and replaced it with `transpose`.

6. Changed the import statement from `tf.cast` to `tf.cast`. This is because TensorFlow 2.0 has removed the `cast` function and replaced it with `cast`.

7. Changed the import statement from `tf.greater` to `tf.cast`. This is because TensorFlow 2.0 has removed the `greater` function and replaced it with `cast`.

8. Changed the import statement from `tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits` to `tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits`. This is because TensorFlow 2.0 has removed the `sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits` function
