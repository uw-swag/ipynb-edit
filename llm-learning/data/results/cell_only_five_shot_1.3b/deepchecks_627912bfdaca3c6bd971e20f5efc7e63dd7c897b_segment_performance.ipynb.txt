1. Refactoring the notebook folder structure:

    - The original code is currently in a single cell. It's not organized in a way that makes it easy to follow the code's flow.
    - We can refactor the code to make it more organized by dividing it into multiple cells.
    - We can also organize the code into different sections or modules based on the functionality it provides.

    Here's an example of how you might refactor the code:

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    from urllib.request import urlopen
    from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

    # Load and preprocess data
    name_data = urlopen('http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.names')
    lines = [l.decode("utf-8") for l in name_data if ':' in l.decode("utf-8") and '|' not in l.decode("utf-8")]

    features = [l.split(':')[0] for l in lines]
    label_name = 'income'

    cat_features = [l.split(':')[0] for l in lines if 'continuous' not in l]

    train_df = pd.read_csv('http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data',
                           names=features + [label_name])
    val_df = pd.read_csv('http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.test',
                        names=features + [label_name], skiprows=1)

    val_df[label_name] = val_df [label_name].str[:-1]

    encoder = LabelEncoder()
    encoder.fit(train_df[label_name])
    train_df[label_name] = encoder.transform(train_df[label_name])
    val_df[label_name] = encoder.transform(val_df[label_name])

    # Import necessary modules
    from mlchecks import Dat
