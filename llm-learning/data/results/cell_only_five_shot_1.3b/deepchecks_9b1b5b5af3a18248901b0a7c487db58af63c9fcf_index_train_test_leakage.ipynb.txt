    Original Code Cells:
    '''

    ]

    ### Response:
    The commit message is clear and describes the changes made in the code. The original code cells are empty, as there are no changes to be made.

    However, the original code cells are empty because the commit message is not providing any code to be modified. If the commit message is "`make docs` errors/warnings fixes   (#725)", it would be more appropriate to have a cell with the command to generate the documentation.

    Here's an example of how the original code cells might look:

    ```python
    # This is a comment
    print("Hello, world!")

    # This is a code cell
    x = 10
    y = 20
    z = x + y
    print(z)
    ```

    The `make docs` command would be added as a new cell at the end of the commit message.

    Please note that the actual implementation of the `make docs` command would depend on the specific documentation generation tool and the structure of the codebase.

    Also, please ensure that the commit message is clear and concise, and that the code cells are appropriately formatted.
