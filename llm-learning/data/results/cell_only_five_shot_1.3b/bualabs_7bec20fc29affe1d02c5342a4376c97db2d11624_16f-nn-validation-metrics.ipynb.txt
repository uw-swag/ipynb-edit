```python
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

    # Split the data into training and validation sets
    X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Initialize the model
    model = SomeModel()

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Validate the model
    y_pred = model.predict(X_val)

    # Calculate the metrics
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_val, y_pred)
    precision = precision_score(y_val, y_pred)
    recall = recall_score(y_val, y_pred)
    f1 = f1_score(y_val, y_pred)

    print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}, Precision: {precision}, Recall: {recall}, F1-score: {f1}')
    ```
    This code will train a model on a training set and validate it on a validation set. The metrics calculated are accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
