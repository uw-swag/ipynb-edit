```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score

    # Load the HR attrition dataset
    df = pd.read_csv('HR_Attrition.csv')

    # Preprocess the data
    # This step depends on the specifics of the dataset.
    # For example, you might need to handle missing values,
    # convert categorical variables to numerical, etc.

    # Select the features
    features = df[['Age', 'DistanceFromHome', 'YearsWithCurrManager', 'YearsSinceLastPromotion', 'YearsInCurrentRole', 'JobSatisfaction', 'EnvironmentSatisfaction', 'WorkLifeBalance', 'JobInvolvement', 'PerformanceRating', 'StockOptionLevel', 'Salary']]

    # Select the target variable
    target = df['Attrition']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Train a logistic regression model
    model = LogisticRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model
    print(classification_report(y_test, predictions))
    print('Accuracy:', accuracy_score(y_test, predictions))

    # This is a simple example. In a real-world case analysis, you would likely need to perform more complex preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection/tuning.
