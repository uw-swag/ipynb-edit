The code you provided is a part of a larger project, and it's not clear what the purpose of the code is. However, it seems to be a part of a data preprocessing pipeline. The code is using the `ColumnTransformer` from `future_encoders` to transform the data, and the `OneHotEncoder` from `sklearn.preprocessing` to convert categorical variables into a format that can be used by machine learning algorithms.

The `future_encoders` module is not a standard Python module, and it's not included in the standard library. It's likely a custom module created by someone else. If you're seeing this code, it's likely that the author has not included it in their project.

If you're seeing this code, it's likely that the author is using it in a way that's not appropriate for their project. For example, they might be using it to perform a specific task, but they're not using it in a way that's appropriate for their project.
