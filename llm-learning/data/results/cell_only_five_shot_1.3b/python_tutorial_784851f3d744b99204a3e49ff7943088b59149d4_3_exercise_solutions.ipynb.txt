    # Exercise 1.1: Basic Numpy Array Operations
    import numpy as np

    # Create a 3x3 numpy array with random integers between 0 and 10
    arr = np.random.randint(0, 10, (3, 3))
    print("Array:")
    print(arr)

    # Exercise 1.2: Array Indexing
    # Access the element at the 1st row and 2nd column
    print("Element at 1st row and 2nd column:")
    print(arr[0, 1])

    # Exercise 1.3: Array Slicing
    # Access the 2nd row and all columns
    print("2nd row:")
    print(arr[1:2, :])

    # Exercise 1.4: Array Reshaping
    # Reshape the array to a 2x2x3 matrix
    print("Reshaped Array:")
    print(arr.reshape(2, 2, 3))

    # Exercise 1.5: Array Broadcasting
    # Broadcasting allows numpy to work with arrays of different shapes when performing arithmetic operations
    arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
    print("Broadcasted Array:")
    print(arr1 + arr2)

    # Exercise 1.6: Array Transpose
    # Transpose the array
    print("Transposed Array:")
    print(arr.T)

    # Exercise 1.7: Array Statistics
    # Calculate the mean, standard deviation, and variance of the array
    print("Mean:")
    print(np.mean(arr))
    print("Standard Deviation:")
    print(np.std(arr))
    print("Variance:")
    print(np.var(arr))

    # Exercise 1.8: Array Math Operations
    # Perform element-wise multiplication, division, and addition
