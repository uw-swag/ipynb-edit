```python
    from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier

    clf = AdaBoostClassifier(random_state=0)
    clf.fit(train_ds.features, train_ds.labels)
    BoostingOverfit().run(train_ds, validation_ds, clf)
    ```

    The original code was transformed to use the properties of the dataset instead of calling the methods directly.
