    The `OrdinalEncoder` and `OneHotEncoder` are used to convert categorical variables into a format that can be used by machine learning algorithms.

    The `OrdinalEncoder` is used when the order of the categories matters. For example, if you have a categorical feature with the values "low", "medium", "high", the `OrdinalEncoder` will convert these values into numerical values 1, 2, 3.

    The `OneHotEncoder` is used when the categories have more than two levels. For example, if you have a categorical feature with the values "red", "blue", "green", the `OneHotEncoder` will convert these values into three binary columns (one for each color).

    In the context of the code provided, the `OrdinalEncoder` is used to convert the categorical variable `housing_cat` into a numerical format that can be used by machine learning algorithms. The `OneHotEncoder` is used to convert the categorical variable `housing_cat_1hot` into a one-hot encoded format.
