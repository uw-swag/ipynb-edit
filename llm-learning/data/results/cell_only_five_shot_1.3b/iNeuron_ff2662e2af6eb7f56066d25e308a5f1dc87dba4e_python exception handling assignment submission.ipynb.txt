```python
    # Assignment:
    # 1. Create a new Python script named "assignment.py"
    # 2. In this script, you need to create a function named "calculate_area" that takes two parameters: "length" and "width". The function should return the area of a rectangle.
    # 3. The function should also handle the case where the parameters are not numbers. In this case, the function should return a string "Error: Both inputs must be numbers."
    # 4. The function should also handle the case where the parameters are negative numbers. In this case, the function should return a string "Error: Length and width must be positive."
    # 5. The function should also handle the case where the parameters are zero. In this case, the function should return a string "Error: Length and width must be greater than zero."

    # Your function should look something like this:
    # def calculate_area(length, width):
    #     if not (isinstance(length, (int, float)) and isinstance(width, (int, float))):
    #         return "Error: Both inputs must be numbers."
    #     elif length <= 0 or width <= 0:
    #         return "Error: Length and width must be positive."
    #     elif length == 0 or width == 0:
    #         return "Error: Length and width must be greater than zero."
    #     else:
    #         return length * width
    ```

    ### Solution:
    ```python
    def calculate_area(length, width):
        if not (isinstance(length, (int, float)) and isinstance(width, (int, float))):
            return "Error: Both inputs must be numbers."
        elif length <= 0 or width <= 0:
            return "Error: Length and width must be positive."
        elif length == 0 or width == 0:
            return "Error: Length and width must be greater than zero."
        else:
            return length * width
    ```
