    # Data preprocessing
    # This step depends on the dataset. For example, you might need to handle missing values,
    # normalize or scale numerical features, one-hot encode categorical features, etc.

    # Splitting the dataset into features and target variable
    X = df.drop('target', axis=1)
    y = df['target']

    # Splitting the dataset into training set and test set
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Feature Scaling
    sc = StandardScaler()

    # You can use seaborn or matplotlib to visualize the results.
    # For example, you can create a heatmap of the confusion matrix.
