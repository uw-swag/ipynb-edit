    Here is the refactored version of the code:

```python
import os
import pickle as pkl
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Load the data
def load_data(folder_path):
    fnames = [oj(folder_path, fname) for fname in os.listdir(folder_path)]
    results_list = [pd.Series(pkl.load(open(fname, "rb"))) for fname in fnames] 
    results = pd.concat(results_list, axis=1).T.infer_objects() 
    return results

# Group the results by dataset, method, and regularizer_rate
def group_by_columns(df, columns):
    return df.groupby(by = columns).mean()

# Save the results
def save_results(df, save_path):
    df.to_csv(oj(save_path, 'results.csv'))

# Load the data
data = load_data('../models/ColorMNIST')

# Group the results by dataset, method, and regularizer_rate
results_save = group_by_columns(data, ['dataset', 'method','regularizer_rate'])

# Save the results
save_results(results_save, '../results_for_export')
```

This refactored version of the code is more readable and maintainable. It separates the data loading, grouping, and saving functions into their own separate functions, which makes the code easier to understand and maintain. It also makes the code more reusable, as the functions can be used in other parts of the code where the same operations can be performed.
