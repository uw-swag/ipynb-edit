    ## Baselines
    # Baseline models are a set of models that are used as a starting point for more complex models. They are often used as a comparison for the performance of the more complex models.

    ## Bigrams
    # Bigrams are a type of n-gram, which is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sample of text or speech.

    ## Simple, Good Sentiment and Topic Classification
    # Simple, Good Sentiment and Topic Classification are three types of sentiment analysis and topic modeling techniques.
