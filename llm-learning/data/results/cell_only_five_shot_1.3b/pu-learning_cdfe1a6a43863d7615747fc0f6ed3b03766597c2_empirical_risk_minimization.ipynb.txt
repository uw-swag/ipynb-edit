The original code is using empirical risk minimization (ERM) to train a logistic regression classifier. However, the code is not correctly implementing ERM. The code is using a labeled data as positive and negative examples, which is not the correct approach.

The correct approach to use in this case is to use empirical risk minimization to train a classifier. The empirical risk minimization is a method to minimize the risk of making a mistake in classification. The risk of making a mistake in classification is the probability of making a mistake in classification, which is the same as the empirical risk.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import log_loss

# Load the data
x, y, s = load_scar()

# Create a new data set with positive and negative examples
x_new = []
y_new = []
sample_weight = []

x_l, x_u = [], []
for x_i, s_i in zip(x, s):
    if s_i == 1:
        x_l.append(x_i)
    else:
        x_u.append(x_i)

x_new.extend(x_u[:])
y_new.extend([0] * len(x_u))
sample_weight.extend([1.0] * len(x_u))

for x_l_i in x_l:
    # use a labeled data as positive
    x_new.append(x_l_i)
    y_new.append(1)
    sample_weight.append(1.0)

    # use a labeled data as negative
    x_new.append(x_l_i)
    y_new.append(0)
    sample_weight.append(1.0)

# Train the classifier
clf = LogisticRegression(random_state=0)
clf.fit(x_new, y_new, sample_weight=sample_weight)

# Predict the labels
y_hat = clf.predict(x)

# Compute the log loss
logloss = log_loss(y, y_hat)
print('Log
