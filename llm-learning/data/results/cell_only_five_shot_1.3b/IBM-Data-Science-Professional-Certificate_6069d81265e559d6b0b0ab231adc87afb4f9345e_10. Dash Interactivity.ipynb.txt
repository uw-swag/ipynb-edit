    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses Dash, a Python framework for building web applications, to create a dashboard for an airline data analysis. 

    The notebook starts by importing the necessary libraries and creating a Dash application. It then reads the airline data into a pandas dataframe, and creates a layout for the dashboard. 

    The layout includes a title, an input box for the year, a line plot of average arrival delay time, and a graph component. 

    The callback function, `get_graph(entered_year)`, is used to compute the graph based on the entered year. This function selects the data for the entered year, groups the data by month and computes the average arrival delay time, and then creates a line plot of the data. 

    The dashboard is then run using the `run_server` method of the Dash application. 

    The notebook also includes a second part, which uses the JupyterDash class from the jupyter_dash library to create a Jupyter notebook-based dashboard. 

    The JupyterDash class is used to create a Dash application in a Jupyter notebook. The notebook then runs the Dash application using the `run_server` method, which also supports Jupyter notebook-based servers.

    The notebook also includes a second part, which uses the JupyterDash class from the jupyter_dash library to create a Jupyter notebook-based dashboard.
