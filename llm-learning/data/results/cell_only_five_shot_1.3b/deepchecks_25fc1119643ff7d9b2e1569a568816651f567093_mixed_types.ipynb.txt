```python
    from deepchecks.checks import NBlinks
    import pandas as pd
    data = {'col1': ['str', '1.0', 1, 2 , 2.61 , 'timtam'], 'col2':['', '', '1.0', 'a', 'b', 'c'], 'col3': [1,2,3,4,5,6]}
    dataframe = pd.DataFrame(data=data)
    NBlinks().run(dataframe)
    data = {'col1': ['foo', 'bar', 'cat']}
    dataframe = pd.DataFrame(data=data)
    NBlinks().run(dataframe)
    ```

    The `NBlinks` check is used to find out if there are any links in the dataframe. If there are, it will return a DataFrame with the links.

    The `NBlinks().run(dataframe)` call is used to run the check on the dataframe. The result will be a DataFrame with the links if any, otherwise it will return an empty DataFrame.

    The `NBlinks` check is not a built-in DeepChecks check, it's a custom check that you can create. You can create a new class that inherits from `NBlinks` and override the `run` method to customize the behavior of the check.
