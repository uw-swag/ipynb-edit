The code you provided is a PyTorch implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The learning rate (`lr`) is being increased in each iteration. The `slice(2e-3)` is used to create a learning rate scheduler that decreases the learning rate by a factor of 0.1 after 20 epochs.

Here's the code with the learning rate increased in each iteration:

```python
# loss_func = XFocalLoss(alpha=1.0, gamma=4.0, reduction='mean')

weights = torch.tensor([[0.8]*1 + [1.2]]).cuda()
loss_func = CrossEntropyLossFlat(weight=weights)

# loss_func = CrossEntropyLossFlat()

for epoch in range(20):
    learn.fit_flat_cos(20, lr=slice(2e-3))
```

In this code, the learning rate is increased by a factor of 0.1 after each 20 epochs. The learning rate scheduler is defined as `slice(2e-3)`, which means the learning rate will be decreased by a factor of 0.1 after 20 epochs.

Please note that the `learn.fit_flat_cos(20, lr=slice(2e-3))` is a placeholder for the actual training loop. The actual training loop will depend on the specifics of your model and data.
