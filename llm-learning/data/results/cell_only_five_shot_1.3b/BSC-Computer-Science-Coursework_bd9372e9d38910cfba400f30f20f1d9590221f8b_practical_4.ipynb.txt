```python
    # Importing necessary libraries
    import pandas as pd
    from scipy import stats

    # Load the dataset
    data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

    # Define the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis
    null_hypothesis = "The average weight is the same for men and women"
    alternative_hypothesis = "The average weight differs for men and women"

    # Calculate the t-test
    t_statistic, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(data[data['gender'] == 'male']['weight'], data[data['gender'] == 'female']['weight'])

    # Print the results
    print(f"T-Statistic: {t_statistic}")
    print(f"P-Value: {p_value}")

    # Decide the conclusion
    if p_value < 0.05:
        print(f"Conclusion: {alternative_hypothesis} is rejected. The difference in average weights is statistically significant.")
    else:
        print(f"Conclusion: {null_hypothesis} is not rejected. The difference in average weights is not statistically significant.")
    ```
    In this code, we are using the t-test to compare the average weights of men and women. The null hypothesis is that the average weight is the same for men and women, and the alternative hypothesis is that the average weight differs for men and women. The p-value is the probability that the observed difference in weights is due to random chance. If the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the difference in average weights is statistically significant. If the p-value is greater than 0.05, we do not reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the difference in average weights is not statistically significant.
