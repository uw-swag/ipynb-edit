```python
    # given an image path or the image url

    img_fp = 'examples/inputs/emma.jpg'
    img = cv2.imread(img_fp)
    plt.imshow(img[..., ::-1])

    img_url = 'https://photovideocreative.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Angles-de-prise-de-vue-horizontal-contreplong%C3%A9-et-plong%C3%A9.jpg'
    img = io.imread(img_url)
    plt.imshow(img)

    img = img[..., ::-1]  # RGB -> BGR
    ```

    ### Explanation:
    The code reads the image from the given file path or the URL, and then displays the image using matplotlib. The image is then reversed to match the typical BGR color space.

    ### Note:
    The code assumes that the image is in the RGB color space. If the image is in the BGR color space, the code will need to be adjusted accordingly.

    ### References:
    The code is based on the OpenCV and matplotlib libraries. If you are not already familiar with these libraries, you may want to review their documentation.

    ### Further Reading:
    For more information on how to use OpenCV with matplotlib, you can refer to the OpenCV documentation on matplotlib.

    ### Troubleshooting:
    If you encounter any issues with the code, please check the OpenCV and matplotlib documentation for troubleshooting tips.
