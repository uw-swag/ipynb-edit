The code you provided is a Go code snippet that defines several functions and types to handle different MIME types and data. Here's a simplified version of the code:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"net/http"
)

func downloadAndDisplay(url string) {
	resp, err := http.Get(url)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error downloading file:", err)
		return
	}
	defer resp.Body.Close()

	data, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error reading file:", err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println(string(data))
}

func main() {
	downloadAndDisplay("https://github.com/gopherdata/gophernotes/raw/master/files/gophernotes-logo.png")
}
```

This simplified version of the code only downloads and displays the file. The `downloadAndDisplay` function takes a URL as a parameter and downloads the file from that URL. It then reads the file and prints the contents to the console.

Please note that this simplified version of the code does not include the `display.PNG` function, which is not a part of the original code you provided. You would need to implement this function yourself or use a library that provides this functionality.
