    The code you provided is a Python notebook that trains a model using the Deep Java Library (djl). The notebook includes a function `trainCh11` that trains a linear regression model using a SGD optimizer. The function is called in a loop to train the model for a number of epochs.

    The function `trainConciseCh11` is a more concise version of `trainCh11`. It uses a SequentialBlock to define the model, and a NormalInitializer to initialize the weights.

    The notebook also includes a function `arrayListToFloat` that converts an ArrayList of Doubles to a float array.

    The notebook also includes a function `evaluateLoss` that computes the loss of a model on a dataset.

    The notebook also includes a function `plotLossEpoch` that plots the loss and epoch values.

    The notebook also includes a function `getDataCh11` that retrieves the dataset for chapter 11.

    The notebook also includes a function `trainConciseCh11` that trains a model using a SGD optimizer.
