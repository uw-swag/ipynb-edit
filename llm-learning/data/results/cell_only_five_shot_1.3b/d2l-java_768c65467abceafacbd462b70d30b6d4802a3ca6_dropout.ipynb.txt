    ## NOTEBOOK: Edit Headings

    ## 1. Introduction
    This notebook is about the implementation of a machine learning model using the Apache Spark library. The model is a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and it's trained using the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer.

    ## 2. Code Explanation
    The code is divided into several sections. The first section imports the necessary libraries and sets the environment path. The next section defines the learning rate tracker and optimizer, the loss function, and the default training configuration. The model is then initialized and the training process is performed using the `fit` method of the `Trainer`. The metrics of the model are collected during the training and evaluation process.

    ## 3. Results
    The results of the training process are stored in a `HashMap` named `evaluatorMetrics`. The keys of the map are the names of the evaluators and the values are arrays of the metrics for each epoch.

    ## 4. Conclusion
    The MLP model is trained and the results are stored in the `evaluatorMetrics` map. The notebook concludes by providing a brief explanation of the code and the results.

    ## 5. References
    The code is based on the Apache Spark documentation and the TensorFlow library.
