    ## Model Details
    The model used is `resnet34`, a pre-trained model from the `torchvision.models` module.

    ## Training Details
    The training process is done for 16 epochs. The learning rate is set to `0.0` initially, but it is gradually reduced to `0.25`, `0.5`, `0.75`, and `1.0` after each epoch.

    ## Model Performance
    The model's performance is evaluated using the `accuracy` metric. The final model's performance after 16 epochs is as follows:
