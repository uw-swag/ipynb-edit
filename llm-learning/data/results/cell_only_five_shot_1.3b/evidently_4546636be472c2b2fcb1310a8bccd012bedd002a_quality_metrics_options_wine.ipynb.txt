    The following functions are used to calculate quality metrics:

    - mean_absolute_error(y_true, y_pred): This function calculates the mean absolute error between the predicted and true values.
    - mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred): This function calculates the mean squared error between the predicted and true values.
    - r2_score(y_true, y_pred): This function calculates the R2 score, which is a measure of how well future samples are likely to be predicted by the model.
