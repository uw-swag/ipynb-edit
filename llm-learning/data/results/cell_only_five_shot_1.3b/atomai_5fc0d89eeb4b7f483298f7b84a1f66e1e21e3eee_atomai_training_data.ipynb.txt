    The code you provided is a part of a larger system that uses the `augmentor` function from the `atomai.utils` module. The `augmentor` function is used to generate augmented images and labels. 

    The `augmentor` function takes several parameters, including the size of the images, the number of images, the number of channels, the order of the dimensions, the type of noise to apply, the zoom level, the flip option, the squeeze option, and the seed for the random number generator.

    The `augmentor` function applies a variety of transformations to the images, including zooming, flipping, noise, and contrast adjustment. The augmented images and labels are then returned.

    The code also prints the shape of the augmented images and labels.

    The version of the `augmentor` function you used is `0.2.4`.

    Please note that the `augmentor` function is not part of the `atomai.utils` module, so you need to install it separately. You can do this by running `pip install atomai`.

    Also, the `atomai.utils` module is not maintained anymore, so you might want to consider using a different library for image augmentation.
