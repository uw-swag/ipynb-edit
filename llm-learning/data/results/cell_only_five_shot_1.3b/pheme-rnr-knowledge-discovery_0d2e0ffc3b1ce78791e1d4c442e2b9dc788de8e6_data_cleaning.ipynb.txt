    The code you've provided seems to be a part of a machine learning pipeline. It's loading a dataset, performing some preprocessing, and then applying two dimensional PCA and t-SNE to visualize the data.

    However, the code is not providing any output or results. This could be due to a number of reasons:

1. The data you're working with might not be suitable for PCA or t-SNE. PCA and t-SNE are used for dimensionality reduction, and they are not suitable for all types of data.

2. The preprocessing steps you've implemented (converting `True` and `False` to 0 and 1, standardizing the columns) might not be working as expected.

3. The model you're using (PCA and t-SNE) might not be suitable for your data. PCA and t-SNE are not suitable for all types of data.

4. The code you're running might not be running as expected. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as a syntax error, a missing library, or an issue with the environment.

To debug this, you would need to check the following:

- The data: Ensure that the data you're working with is suitable for PCA and t-SNE.
- The preprocessing: Ensure that the preprocessing steps you've implemented are working as expected.
- The model: Ensure that the model you're using is suitable for your data.
- The code: Ensure that the code you're running is running as expected.

If you're still not getting any results, you might need to provide more information about the data, the preprocessing steps, and the model you're using.
