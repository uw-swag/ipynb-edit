```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np

    # Create a simple dataset
    data = {'Name': ['Tom', 'Nick', 'John', 'Tom'],
            'Age': [20, 21, 19, 20],
            'Score': [85, 80, 90, 85]}
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)

    # Print the dataset
    print(df)

    # Rerun the notebook
    ```
    The above code will create a simple dataset and print it. If you want to rerun the notebook, you can simply execute the code again.

    Please note that the code above is a placeholder and will not work as expected. The actual code to rerun the notebook would depend on the specifics of your environment and the changes you made.

    Also, please ensure that you have the necessary permissions to rerun the notebook.
