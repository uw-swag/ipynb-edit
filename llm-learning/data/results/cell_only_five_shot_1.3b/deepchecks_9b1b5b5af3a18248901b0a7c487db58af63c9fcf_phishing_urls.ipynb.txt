    ### Response:
    The `make docs` command in the commit message is used to build the documentation. However, it seems there are no original code cells provided in the commit message. 

    If you're referring to the `make docs` command, it's a part of the Makefile in the repository. The Makefile is used to automate the building of the documentation.

    If you're referring to the errors or warnings that are displayed when running the `make docs` command, it's not clear from the provided information. 

    If you can provide the original code cells that are causing the errors or warnings, I would be able to help you fix them.

    Please note that the actual error or warning messages will depend on the specifics of the project and the configuration of the build system.

    If you're not sure about the errors or warnings, you might want to check the build logs or the documentation for more information.
