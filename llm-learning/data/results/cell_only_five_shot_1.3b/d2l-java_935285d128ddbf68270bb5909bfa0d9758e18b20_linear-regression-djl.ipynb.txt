    The Maven repository URLs you provided are for the Maven snapshots repository. The `%maven` command is used to add dependencies to your Maven project.

    The `ai.djl:api:0.7.0-SNAPSHOT`, `ai.djl:model-zoo:0.7.0-SNAPSHOT`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.26`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:1.7.26`, `net.java.dev.jna:jna:5.3.0`, and `ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-engine:0.7.0-SNAPSHOT` are the versions of the dependencies you're trying to add.

    The `ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-native-auto:1.7.0-a` is the version of the mxnet-native library you're trying to update.

    To update the mxnet-native version, you would use the following command:

    ```
    %maven ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-native-auto:1.7.0-a
    ```

    This command will download the latest version of the mxnet-native library and add it to your project.

    Please note that the `%maven` command is a Maven specific command and may not work in other build tools or environments.
