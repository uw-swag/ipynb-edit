    The code provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the Deepchecks library to perform data integrity checks on a phishing dataset. The notebook first loads the dataset, then it uses the DataDuplicates check to find duplicate rows in the dataset. The duplicates are then removed. The notebook also demonstrates how to use the DataDuplicates check with different parameters to customize the check. The final check is run on the dataset and the results are displayed.

    However, the commit message "Deleting notebooks (#1088)" suggests that the notebooks are being deleted. This is not a valid commit message as it doesn't provide any changes to the code. The code provided is a complete runnable Jupyter notebook that performs data integrity checks on a phishing dataset.
