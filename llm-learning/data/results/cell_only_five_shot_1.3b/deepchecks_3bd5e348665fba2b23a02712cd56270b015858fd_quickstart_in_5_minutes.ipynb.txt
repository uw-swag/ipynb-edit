```python
    # Import necessary libraries
    import deepchecks as dc
    import pandas as pd

    # Load your dataset
    df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

    # Create a DeepChecks dataset
    dataset = dc.Dataset(df)

    # Perform a drift check
    check = dc.drift.Check(dataset)

    # Run the check
    report = check.run()

    # Print the report
    print(report)
    ```

    This script will perform a dataset drift check using DeepChecks, a Python library for data drift detection. The check is performed on the dataset loaded from a CSV file. The report will provide information about the drift, such as the drift type (if any), the drift score, and the drift explanation.

    Please replace 'your_dataset.csv' with the path to your actual dataset.

    If you don't have DeepChecks installed, you can install it using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install deepchecks --quiet
    ```

    This script assumes that you have a CSV file with your dataset. If your dataset is in a different format, you'll need to adjust the code accordingly.
