    The code you provided is used to find the 10 most and 10 least useful parameters for a Ridge regression model. The `Ridge` function from the `sklearn.linear_model` module is used to create a Ridge regression model. The `fit` method is used to train the model, and the `coef_` attribute is used to get the coefficients of the model. The `sort_values` method is used to sort the coefficients in descending order, and the `head` and `tail` methods are used to get the 10 most and 10 least useful parameters. The `plot` method is used to create a bar plot of the coefficients.
