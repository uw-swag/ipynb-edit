The code you provided is splitting the VisionData and removing formatters. The VisionData is a class in DeepChecks that is used to load and manage datasets for vision-related tasks. The formatters are used to format the data before it is used in the model.

The code is splitting the VisionData into training and testing sets. The `load_dataset` function is used to load the dataset, and the `train=False` parameter is used to load the test set. The `batch_size` parameter is used to specify the number of samples to be loaded in each batch.

The `load_model` function is used to load the model.

The code is then using the `validate_formatters` function to validate the formatters. This function checks if the formatters are correctly applied to the data.

The formatters are applied to the data in the following order:

1. The `label_formatter` is applied to the labels.
2. The `image_formatter` is applied to the images.
3. The `pred_formatter` is applied to the predictions.

The `yolo_prediction_formatter` function is used to modify the predictions from the yolo format to the format expected by the `pred_formatter`.

The `pil_image_formatter` function is used to convert the images from PIL format to numpy arrays.

The `validate_formatters` function is used to validate the formatters again.

The code is then validating the formatters again to ensure they are working correctly.

The final step is to train the model using the training data and validate it using the test data.

Please note that the code provided is a simplified example and may not work as expected in all scenarios. It is recommended to run the code in a controlled environment to ensure it works as expected.
