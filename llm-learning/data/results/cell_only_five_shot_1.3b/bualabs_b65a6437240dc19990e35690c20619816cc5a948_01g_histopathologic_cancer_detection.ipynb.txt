The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the PyTorch and Kaggle API to perform image classification on a dataset. Here's a brief explanation of what the code does:

1. It imports necessary libraries and loads the dataset.
2. It defines a function `get_transforms` that creates a data augmentation pipeline.
3. It creates a DataBunch object from the dataset, which is a PyTorch object that contains the data and labels.
4. It trains a DenseNet model on the data using the DataBunch object.
5. It fine-tunes the model by adjusting the learning rate.
6. It makes predictions on the test set and submits the predictions to the Kaggle competition.

The code seems to be missing the part where the model is unfreeze and the learning rate is adjusted again. I'm not sure what the purpose of the code is, but I'm assuming it's a part of a larger pipeline that includes the model unfreezing and learning rate adjustment.

If you want to change the data augmentation to not rotate, etc., you can modify the `get_transforms` function to include the desired transformations. For example, you can use `tfms = get_transforms(flip_vert=True, max_rotate=0.)` to not rotate the images.

If you want to remove the mixup, you can remove the `mixup` method from the `cnn_learner` call.
