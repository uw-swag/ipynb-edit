The code you've provided seems to be a part of a larger process, and it seems to be related to audio processing and digit recognition. Here's a brief explanation of what the code does:

1. It uses the `librosa` library to time stretch and pitch shift audio files.
2. It writes the time-stretched and pitch-shifted audio files to disk.

The code is written in Python and uses several libraries such as `librosa` for audio processing, `soundfile` for writing audio files, and `pandas` for data manipulation.

The `librosa` library is used for audio processing tasks such as time stretching and pitch shifting. It's a powerful library that can be used for a wide range of audio processing tasks.

The `soundfile` library is used to write audio files.

The `pandas` library is used for data manipulation tasks.

The code seems to be part of a larger process, and it's unclear what the purpose of the `for` loops and the `for` loop in the `if` statement are.

If you're looking to implement the same functionality using the `AudioMNIST` dataset, you would need to use a different approach, as `AudioMNIST` is a dataset of audio clips, not audio files. You would need to use a machine learning model to train a model on this data, and then use that model to recognize digits in new audio clips.

Here's a rough outline of how you might do this:

1. Load the `AudioMNIST` dataset.
2. Preprocess the audio clips to be suitable for input to a machine learning model.
3. Train a machine learning model on the `AudioMNIST` dataset.
4. Use the trained model to recognize digits in new audio clips.

This is a complex task that would require a good understanding of machine learning and audio processing. If you're not familiar with these topics, you might want to consider seeking help from a mentor or a tutor.
