    ## Experiment 1: Short comments on new settings
    We have experimented with a new setting where we use a different learning rate for the optimizer. The learning rate is set to 0.01, which is a commonly used value. This learning rate is chosen to be smaller than the default learning rate of 0.1, which is commonly used. This smaller learning rate is used to speed up the convergence of the optimizer, which is crucial for training deep learning models.

    ## Experiment 2: Short comments on new settings
    We have also experimented with a new setting where we use a different regularization parameter for the optimizer. The regularization parameter is set to 0.001, which is a commonly used value. This regularization parameter is used to prevent overfitting in the model. We have also experimented with different values for the regularization parameter, such as 0.0001, 0.00001, and 0.000001. The regularization parameter is chosen to be a value that balances between the model's complexity and the risk of overfitting.

    ## Experiment 3: Short comments on new settings
    We have also experimented with a new setting where we use a different batch size for the optimizer. The batch size is set to 64, which is a commonly used value. This batch size is used to control the amount of memory that is used to store the gradients during backpropagation. We have also experimented with different values for the batch size, such as 128, 256, and 512. The batch size is chosen to be a value that balances between the model's speed and the memory it requires.

    ## Experiment 4: Short comments on new settings
    We have also experimented with a new setting where we use a different number of epochs for the training. The number of epochs is set to 100, which is a commonly used value. This number of epochs is used to control the number of times the model is trained on the entire dataset. We have also experimented with different values for the number of epochs, such as 50, 100, and 200. The number of epochs is chosen to be a value
