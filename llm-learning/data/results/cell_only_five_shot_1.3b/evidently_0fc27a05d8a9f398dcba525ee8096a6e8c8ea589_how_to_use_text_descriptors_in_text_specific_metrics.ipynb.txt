The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook and it seems to be related to semantic similarity and custom descriptor index values. The issue is that the custom descriptor index values are not being set correctly.

The code is using the `TextDescriptorsDriftMetric` and `TextDescriptorsCorrelationMetric` from `evidently` library. These metrics are used to measure the semantic similarity between two sets of text.

The issue seems to be that the custom descriptors are not being set correctly. The custom descriptors are defined in the `descriptors` parameter of the `TextDescriptorsDriftMetric` and `TextDescriptorsCorrelationMetric`.

The custom descriptors are supposed to be used to measure the semantic similarity between two sets of text. However, the custom descriptor index values are not being set correctly.

The `TextDescriptorsDriftMetric` and `TextDescriptorsCorrelationMetric` are supposed to take a `descriptors` parameter, which is a dictionary where the keys are the column names and the values are the descriptors. However, the `descriptors` parameter is not being used in the code.
