    The code you provided is a DeepChecks check that compares the sizes of the train and test datasets. The check is used to ensure that the datasets are of the correct size.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The `DatasetSizeComparison` class inherits from `TrainTestBaseCheck`, which is a base class for all checks.

    - The `run` method is the main method that is called when the check is run. It takes the train and test datasets as input, and returns a `CheckResult` object.

    - The `run` method first calculates the sizes of the train and test datasets.

    - It then creates a `CheckResult` object, which is a dictionary that contains the results of the check. The results are the sizes of the train and test datasets.

    - The `display` attribute of the `CheckResult` object is a list of functions that are used to display the results of the check. In this case, it creates a bar graph that displays the sizes of the train and test datasets.

    - The `graph_display` function is a function that creates the bar graph. It takes no arguments, and creates a bar graph with the sizes of the train and test datasets.

    - The `sizes_df_for_display` is a DataFrame that is used to display the sizes of the train and test datasets. It is created by converting the sizes dictionary to a DataFrame.

    - Finally, the `run` method returns the `CheckResult` object.

    This check is used to ensure that the train and test datasets have the correct size.
