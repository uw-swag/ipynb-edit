    ## Links-checks Github Action Fix (#775)

    This is a fix for the Github Action that checks for links in the code. The fix involves the use of the `check-urls` action from the `actions/check-urls` repository.

    The `check-urls` action checks the URLs in the code and returns an error if any of them are not valid. This can be useful for catching typos or broken links.

    Here is a simple example of how to use the `check-urls` action in a workflow:

    ```yaml
    name: Links-checks

    on:
      push:
        branches: [ master ]

    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
        - name: Checkout code
          uses: actions/checkout@v2

        - name: Set up Python
          uses: actions/setup-python@v2
          with:
            python-version: 3.8

        - name: Install dependencies
          run: |
            python -m pip install --upgrade pip
            pip install -r requirements.txt

        - name: Check for links
          uses: actions/check-urls@v1
    ```

    This workflow will run the `check-urls` action on every push to the `master` branch. It will check the URLs in the code and return an error if any of them are not valid.

    Please note that this is a simple example and might not cover all cases. You may need to adjust the workflow to fit your specific needs.
