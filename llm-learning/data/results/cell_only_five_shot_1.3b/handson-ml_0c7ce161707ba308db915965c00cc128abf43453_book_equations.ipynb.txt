    # Fix error in Equation 13-1
    # The error in the equation 13-1 is due to the incorrect use of the "+" operator.
    # The correct operator to use in this context is the "*" operator.
    # The equation should be written as:
    # 
    # 13-1 = (13 - 1) * 2
    # 
    # This is the corrected equation.
    #
    # The corrected code is:
    #
    # 13-1 = (13 - 1) * 2
    #
    # This is the corrected code.
