    The code you've provided is a simple example of using the Deep Java Library (DJL) to create a simple linear regression model and plot the result. DJL is a machine learning library in Java that provides a high-level API for building and training machine learning models.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The code imports necessary libraries and classes.
    - It creates a new instance of the `NDManager` class, which is a base class for all NDArray objects.
    - It creates a float array `X` and `Y` that represent the input and output data for the linear regression model.
    - It creates a table `data` with two columns: "X" and "relu(x)".
    - It renders a line plot of the data using the `render` method.

    Please note that the code is written in a Jupyter notebook format, and it uses the `render` method to display the plot. The `render` method is part of the DJL library and is used to display the plot in a web browser.

    If you're looking to upgrade to a newer version of DJL (0.11.0), you can do so by updating the version in the Maven configuration in your project's pom.xml file. For example, if you want to upgrade to version 0.11.0, you would add the following line to your pom.xml file:

    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>ai.djl</groupId>
        <artifactId>api</artifactId>
        <version>0.11.0</version>
    </dependency>
    ```

    After updating the version, you can run `mvn clean install` to download and install the new version of the library.
