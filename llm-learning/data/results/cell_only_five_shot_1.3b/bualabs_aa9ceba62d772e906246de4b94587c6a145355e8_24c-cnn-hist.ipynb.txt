    ### Description:
    The code is a PyTorch implementation of a model training process. The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the CIFAR10 dataset. The training process includes hooks to measure the statistics of the model's output, which are then plotted. The code also includes a function to get the minimum value of the model's output, which is used to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the model's output.

    ### Conclusion:
    The code demonstrates the use of PyTorch's hooks to measure the statistics of a model's output. This is a powerful tool for debugging and analyzing the behavior of a model. The code also includes a function to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the model's output, which can be useful in various applications.
