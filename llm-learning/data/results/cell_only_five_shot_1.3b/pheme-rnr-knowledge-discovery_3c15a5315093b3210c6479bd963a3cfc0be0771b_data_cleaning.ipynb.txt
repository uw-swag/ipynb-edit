    The code you provided is a function that aggregates tweets by thread, and it also includes features that are not included in the original function. Here's a brief explanation of the features added:

    1. `time_to_first_resp`: This feature calculates the time it took for the first response to be posted, which is the time difference between the creation time of the thread and the time of the first response.

    2. `time_to_last_resp`: This feature calculates the time it took for the last response to be posted, which is the time difference between the creation time of the thread and the time of the last response.

    The function also includes features that are not included in the original function, such as the number of components in the largest connected component of the graph, the diameter of the largest connected component, and the length of the thread.

    The function also includes features that are not included in the original function, such as the proportion of URLs in the thread, the number of hashtags, and the length of the thread.

    The function also includes features that are not included in the original function, such as the number of followers, the number of listed accounts, the user verification status, the creation time of the thread, and the total number of tweets.

    The function also includes features that are not included in the original function, such as the first response time, the last response time, and the variance of the response times.
