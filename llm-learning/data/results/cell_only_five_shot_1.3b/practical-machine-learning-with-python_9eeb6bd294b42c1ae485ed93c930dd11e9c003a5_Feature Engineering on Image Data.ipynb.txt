```
    dog_r = dog[:,:,0]
    dog_g = dog[:,:,1]
    dog_b = dog[:,:,2]
    plot_image = np.concatenate((dog_r, dog_g, dog_b), axis=1)
    plt.figure(figsize = (10,4))
    plt.imshow(plot_image)
    ```

    The code above is used to display a 3D image of a dog by concatenating the RGB channels of the image. The RGB channels are then plotted using the `imshow` function from the matplotlib library.
