    ### Response:
    The code provided is a function that uploads a file to a Google Cloud Storage bucket. This function is used in a Jupyter notebook to upload a file to a Google Cloud Storage bucket.

    Here's how you can use it:

    ```python
    upload_blob('my-bucket', 'local/path/to/file', 'storage-object-name')
    ```

    This will upload the file at `local/path/to/file` to the bucket `my-bucket` with the name `storage-object-name`.

    Please replace `'my-bucket'`, `'local/path/to/file'`, and `'storage-object-name'` with your actual bucket name, local file path, and desired storage object name respectively.

    Also, make sure you have the Google Cloud SDK and the Google Cloud Storage Python client library installed. You can install them using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install google-cloud-storage
    ```

    And you need to authenticate your application with Google Cloud:

    ```bash
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```

    This will open a
