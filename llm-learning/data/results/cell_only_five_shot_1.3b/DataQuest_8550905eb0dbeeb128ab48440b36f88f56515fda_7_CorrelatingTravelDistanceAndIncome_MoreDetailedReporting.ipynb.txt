```python
    import os
    os.system('git pull origin master')
    ```

    This code will sync your local project with the latest version on the remote repository.

    Please note that this will only work if you have a remote repository set up. If you don't, you'll need to set up a remote repository first.

    Also, this will only work if you're on a Unix-like system (like Linux or MacOS). If you're on Windows, you'll need to use a different command.

    Finally, this will only work if you're in a directory that contains a .git folder. If you're not in a git directory, you'll need to navigate to the correct directory before running this command.
