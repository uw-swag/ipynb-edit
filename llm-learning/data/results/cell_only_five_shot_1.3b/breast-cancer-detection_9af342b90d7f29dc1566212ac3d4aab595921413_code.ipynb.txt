```python
    # Load the dataset
    data = load_breast_cancer()
    X = data.data
    y = data.target

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Standardize the features
    sc = StandardScaler()
    X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = sc.transform(X_test)

    # Define the model
    model = XGBClassifier()

    # Perform cross-validation
    from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
    scores = cross_val_score(model, X_train, y_train, cv=5)
    print("Cross-validation scores: {}".format(scores))
    print("Mean cross-validation score: {}".format(scores.mean()))

    ```
    This code will perform 5-fold cross-validation on the training data, and print the scores for each fold and the mean score. This is a basic example of how to implement cross-validation for an XGBoost model.

    Please note that the `cross_val_score` function in scikit-learn uses the model's default parameters, so you may need to adjust the parameters to get the best results.
