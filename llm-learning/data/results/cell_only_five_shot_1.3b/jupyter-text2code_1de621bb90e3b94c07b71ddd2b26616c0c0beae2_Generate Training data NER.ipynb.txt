```python
    import torch
from transformers import pipeline

# Initialize the pipeline
nlp = pipeline("text2code", model="microsoft/Codex-v2-Base")

# Test the pipeline
code = nlp(text="Your text goes here")[0]['generated_code']
print(code)
    ```

    ### Response:
    The code provided is a simple example of how to use the `Text2Code` model from the `transformers` library to generate code snippets. 

    However, please note that the `Text2Code` model is a complex model and it may not always generate accurate results. It's also important to note that the `Text2Code` model is a large model and it may take a long time to generate code snippets.

    If you want to use the `Text2Code` model for a specific task, you may need to fine-tune the model on your specific task.

    Here is a simple example of how to use the `Text2Code` model:

    ```python
    import torch
    from transformers import pipeline

    # Initialize the pipeline
    nlp = pipeline("text2code", model="microsoft/Codex-v2-Base")

    # Test the pipeline
    code = nlp(text="Your text goes here")[0]['generated_code']
    print(code)
    ```

    This code will print the generated code snippet.
