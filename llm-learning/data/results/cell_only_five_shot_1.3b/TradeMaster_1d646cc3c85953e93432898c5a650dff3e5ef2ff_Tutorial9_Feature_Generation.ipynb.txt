    # Auto Feature Generation Tutorial
    # In this tutorial, we will be using the Auto Feature Generation feature in the scikit-learn library.
    # Auto Feature Generation is a feature selection method that automatically selects the most relevant features for a given model.

    # Importing necessary libraries
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectFromModel
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

    # Loading the iris dataset
    iris = load_iris()
    X = iris.data
    y = iris.target

    # Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Training a Random Forest Classifier
    rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
    rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Using SelectFromModel for feature selection
    selector = SelectFromModel(rf, prefit=True)

    # Selecting the most relevant features
    X_important_train = selector.transform(X_train)
    X_important_test = selector.transform(X_test)

    # Print the number of selected features
    print("Number of selected features: ", X_important_train.shape[1])

    # Now, you can use the selected features for further analysis or modeling
    ```

    This tutorial demonstrates how to use the Auto Feature Generation feature in the scikit-learn library. The feature selection is done using the SelectFromModel class, which automatically selects the most relevant features for a given model.

    The tutorial also shows how to use the selected features for further analysis or modeling.
