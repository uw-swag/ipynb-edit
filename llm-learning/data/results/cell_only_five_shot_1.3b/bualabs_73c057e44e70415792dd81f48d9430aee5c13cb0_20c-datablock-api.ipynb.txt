    # Introduction
    Contrastive learning is a type of machine learning algorithm that is used in various applications, including image classification, natural language processing, and more. It's a method of learning representations by training a model to learn how similar instances are to each other.

    # Getting Started
    To get started with contrastive learning, you need to install the `fastai` and `fastbook` libraries. You can do this using pip:

    ```python
    pip install fastai fastbook
    ```

    ## File Description
    - `fastai`: This is the main library for fastai. It provides a set of tools for building and training models.
    - `fastbook`: This is a collection of Jupyter notebooks that provide a quick introduction to fastai.
    - `fastai.vision`: This module provides a set of pre-trained models for image classification, and tools for loading and preprocessing images.
    - `fastai.metrics`: This module provides metrics for evaluating the performance of a model.

    ## Usage
    Here's a simple example of how to use contrastive learning:

    ```python
    from fastai import *
    from fastai.vision import *
    from fastai.metrics import accuracy

    # Load the data
    data = ImageDataBunch.from_folder(path='./data')

    # Create the model
    model = ContrastiveLearningModel(data)

    # Train the model
    model.fit(10, 1e-2)

    # Evaluate the model
    model.evaluate(test_dl=data.test_dl())
    ```
