```python
    # you can also include if statements to filter the elements
    a_list1 = [i+1 for i in range(10) if i % 2]
    print(a_list1)

    # the same in a for loop
    a_list2 = []
    for i in range(10):
        if i % 2:
            a_list2.append(i+1)
    print(a_list2)
    ```

    ### Explanation:
    The list comprehension is a concise way to create lists in Python. It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for statement, then zero or more for or if statements. The expressions can be anything, meaning you can put in all kinds of objects in lists.

    The if statement is optional and can be used to include conditions in the list comprehension.

    In the first example, the list comprehension is creating a new list that includes the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. The if statement is filtering out the even numbers, so only the odd numbers are included.

    In the second example, the for loop is used to create the same list. The if statement is also used to filter out the even numbers.

    The result is a new list that includes only the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.
