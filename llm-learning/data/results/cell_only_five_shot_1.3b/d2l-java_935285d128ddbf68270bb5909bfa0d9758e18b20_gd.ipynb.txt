    %mavenRepo snapshots https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/

    %maven ai.djl:api:0.7.0-SNAPSHOT
    %maven org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.26
    %maven org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:1.7.26

    %maven ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-native-auto:1.7.0-a
    ```

    This code is used to update the Maven repository to use the SNAPSHOT version of the mxnet-native library.

    The `%mavenRepo` command is used to add a new repository to Maven. The first argument is the URL of the repository, and the second argument is the name of the repository.

    The `%maven` command is used to add a new Maven artifact to the repository. The first argument is the group and artifact ID of the artifact, and the remaining arguments are the version and classifier of the artifact.

    In this case, the `%maven` commands are used to add the `ai.djl:api`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-api`, and `org.slf4j:slf4j-simple` artifacts, and the `ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-engine` and `ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-native-auto` artifacts.

    The `0.7.0-SNAPSHOT` version of the artifacts are used, and the `1.7.26` version of the Maven artifacts are used.

    The `1.7.0-a` version of the `ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-native-auto` artifact is used, which is an SNAPSHOT version.

    Please note that you need to have the necessary permissions to add artifacts to the repository.
