```
    from git import Repo

    repo = Repo('/path/to/your/project')
    repo.remotes.origin.pull()
    ```

    This code will sync your project with the latest version on the remote repository.

    Please replace '/path/to/your/project' with the actual path to your project.

    Also, make sure you have the `git` library installed in your Python environment. If not, you can install it using pip:

    ```
    pip install gitpython
    ```

    If you're using a Jupyter notebook, you can run this code in a cell to sync your project.

    If you're using a different type of notebook, you'll need to replace the `Repo` and `pull` calls with the appropriate methods for your notebook environment.
