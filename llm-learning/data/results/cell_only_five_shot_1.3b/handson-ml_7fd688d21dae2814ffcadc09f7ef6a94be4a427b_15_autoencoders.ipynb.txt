    The code you provided is using TensorFlow's high-level API, which is more user-friendly and allows for more flexibility in defining complex models. The `tf.layers` module is used instead of the `tf.contrib.layers` module, which provides a more straightforward and user-friendly interface for defining neural network layers.

    The `tf.layers` module provides a set of pre-defined layers that can be used to build complex neural network models. It includes things like convolutional layers, fully connected layers, and others. These layers are defined in a more intuitive and flexible way, which can make the code easier to read and understand.

    However, it's important to note that the `tf.layers` module is still in the experimental phase and may not be fully supported in all TensorFlow versions. Therefore, it's recommended to use the `tf.contrib.layers` module for the most part.

    In your code, you're using the `fully_connected` function from the `tf.contrib.layers` module to define the layers of your neural network. This function takes care of the necessary initializations and regularizations, which can make the code easier to read and understand.

    The `tf.layers` module also provides a more flexible and user-friendly interface for defining neural network layers. It allows you to specify the activation function, weights initializer, and other options directly, which can make the code easier to read and understand.
