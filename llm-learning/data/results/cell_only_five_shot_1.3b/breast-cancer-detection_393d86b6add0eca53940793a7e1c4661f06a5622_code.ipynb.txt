```python
    # Improve model performance by tuning hyperparameters
    hparams = prepare_hparams(yaml_file,
                              news_feature_file=news_feature_file,
                              user_history_file=user_history_file,
                              wordEmb_file=wordEmb_file,
                              entityEmb_file=entityEmb_file,
                              epochs=epoch,
                              lr=0.01,
                              batch_size=128,
                              hidden_dim=100,
                              dropout=0.5,
                              weight_decay=0.001)

    # Re-run the model with the new hyperparameters
    if run_MIND_small:
        input_creator = DKNTextIterator
        model = DKN(hparams, input_creator)
        model.fit(train_file, valid_file)
        model.run_get_embedding(news_feature_file, infer_embedding_file)
    ```
    This code changes the hyperparameters of the model to improve its performance. The new hyperparameters include learning rate (`lr`), batch size (`batch_size`), hidden dimension (`hidden_dim`), dropout rate (`dropout`), and weight decay (`weight_decay`). The model is then re-run with these new hyperparameters.
