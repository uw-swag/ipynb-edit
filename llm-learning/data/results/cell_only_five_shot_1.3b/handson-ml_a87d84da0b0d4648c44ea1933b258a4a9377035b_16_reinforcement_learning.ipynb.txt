The `tf.contrib.layers.variance_scaling_initializer` has been moved to `tf.variance_scaling_initializer`. This change is made to ensure consistency with the rest of the TensorFlow codebase.

In the code you provided, the `variance_scaling_initializer` is used to initialize the weights of the neural network. However, the `variance_scaling_initializer` is not used in the provided code.

If you want to use the `variance_scaling_initializer`, you should replace the `variance_scaling_initializer` with `tf.variance_scaling_initializer()`.

Here is the updated code:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# 1. Specify the network architecture
n_inputs = 4  # == env.observation_space.shape[0]
n_hidden = 4  # it's a simple task, we don't need more than this
n_outputs = 1 # only outputs the probability of accelerating left
initializer = tf.variance_scaling_initializer()

# 2. Build the neural network
X = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, n_inputs])
hidden = tf.layers.dense(X, n_hidden, activation=tf.nn.elu,
                         kernel_initializer=initializer)
outputs = tf.layers.dense(hidden, n_outputs, activation=tf.nn.sigmoid,
                          kernel_initializer=initializer)

# 3. Select a random action based on the estimated probabilities
p_left_and_right = tf.concat(axis=1, values=[outputs, 1 - outputs])
action = tf.multinomial(tf.log(p_left_and_right), num_samples=1)

init = tf.global_variables_initializer()
```

Please note that the `variance_scaling_initializer` is a more recent addition to TensorFlow, and it's not available in the older versions. Therefore, you might need to upgrade your TensorFlow version if you're
