    This notebook is designed to analyze and visualize the performance of a football team in different seasons. The notebook includes data scraping, data processing, and data visualization steps.

    The notebook starts with data scraping from a website, which is then processed to extract relevant information. The processed data is then used to create various features and metrics, such as goals scored, conceded, and points.

    The notebook also includes a function to calculate the difference in points, goals scored, and goals conceded between two teams. This is done for each match in the season.

    Finally, the notebook includes a function to calculate the difference in points between two teams, and a function to calculate the difference in form points between two teams.

    The notebook is designed to be run in a Jupyter notebook environment, and it uses the pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn libraries for data processing and visualization.

    The notebook is also designed to be run once and save the seasons data, which is done by running the last cell.

    The notebook is also designed to be run in a Jupyter notebook environment, and it uses the pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn libraries for data processing and visualization.
