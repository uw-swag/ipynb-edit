    # Exercise 7:
    # In the previous chapter, we learned about the concept of a binary search tree.
    # Now, we will implement a solution for the problem of finding the kth largest element in a binary search tree.

    # The Binary Search Tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:
    # 1. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node’s key.
    # 2. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
    # 3. The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

    # The kth largest element is the key of the node in the BST that would be returned if we were performing a right rotation on the tree.

    # Here is a Python solution for the problem:

    class TreeNode:
        def __init__(self, x):
            self.val = x
            self.left = None
            self.right = None

    class Solution:
        def kthLargestValue(self, root: TreeNode, k: int) -> int:
            self.values = []
            self.k = k
            self.findValues(root)
            self.values.sort(reverse=True)
            return self.values[k - 1]

        def findValues(self, node):
            if node is None:
                return []
            left_values = self.findValues(node.left)
            right_values = self.findValues(node.right)
            current_value = left_values + right_values + [node.val]
            current_value.sort(reverse=True)
            self.values = current_value

    # This solution works by first finding all the values in the BST in reverse order (since we want the kth largest element),
    # then sorting the list in reverse order to get the kth largest element.
    # The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the number of nodes in the BST.
    # The space complexity is O(n) due to the
