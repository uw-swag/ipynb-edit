```python
    # ! kaggle competitions submit planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space -f {path/'submission.csv'} -m "My submission"
    ```

    This command is used to submit your Kaggle competition submission. The first argument is the competition name, the second argument is the path to your submission file, and the third argument is the message to be included in the submission.

    Please replace `{path/'submission.csv'}` with the actual path to your submission file.

    Also, make sure you have the necessary permissions to submit the competition.

    Please note that the `{path/'submission.csv'}` should be replaced with the actual path to your submission file.

    The `-m "My submission"` part is optional and is used to provide a message to the Kaggle community about your submission.

    If you don't provide a message, the default message will be "My submission" which is the name of the script.

    If you want to submit your code to a different competition, you can replace `planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space` with the name of the competition.

    For example, if you want to submit your code to the competition "Deep Learning for Computer Vision", you can use:

    ```python
    # ! kaggle competitions submit deep-learning-for-computer-vision -f {path/'submission.csv'} -m "My submission"
    ```

    Please replace `{path/'submission.csv'}` with the actual path to your submission file.
