    # Adaline notes
    # Adaline is a type of linear classifier that is used for binary classification.
    # It is a simple model that is used for learning decision boundaries.
    # The main idea behind Adaline is to fit the data points in a linear fashion.
    # The model is trained by updating the weights of the linear function.
    # The weights are updated in a way that minimizes the error.
    # The error is calculated as the Euclidean distance between the predicted and actual output.
