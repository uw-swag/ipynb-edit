    ### Response:
    The VAE model is defined in the code cell you provided. It's a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model, which is a type of autoencoder. The model consists of an encoder and a decoder, and the training process involves minimizing the difference between the original data and the reconstructed data.

    Here is the complete code:
