    # Assume we have a dataset 'data' with features in 'X' and target in 'y'
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.drop('target', axis=1), data['target'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Create a Gaussian Naive Bayes model
    gnb = GaussianNB()

    # Fit the model
    gnb.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    y_pred = gnb.predict(X_test)

    # Calculate the accuracy
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

    print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")

    # Now, you can use this model for prediction in your practical 07
