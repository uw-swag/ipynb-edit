    ## Metrics

    - **MAP@10:** Mean Average Precision at K. It is the average of the precision values for the top K recommended items.
    - **NDCG@10:** Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at K. It is the average of the DCG values for the top K recommended items.
    - **Precision@10:** Precision is the ratio of correctly recommended items to the total number of recommended items.
    - **Recall@10:** Recall is the ratio of correctly recommended items to the total number of actual positive items.

    - **NDCG@100:** Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at K. It is the average of the DCG values for the top K recommended items.
    - **Precision@100:** Precision is the ratio of correctly recommended items to the total number of recommended items.
    - **Recall@100:** Recall is the ratio of correctly recommended items to the total number of actual positive items.

    ## Anomaly Detection

    - **Anomaly Score:** The anomaly score is the difference between the actual rating and the predicted rating.
    - **Anomaly Count:** The number of items that have an anomaly score greater than a certain threshold.

    ## Recommendation System

    - **Recommendation Rate:** The rate at which the recommendation system recommends items.
    - **Recommendation Count:** The total number of items recommended.

    ## Evaluation Metrics

    - **Precision:** The ratio of correctly recommended items to the total number of recommended items.
    - **Recall:** The ratio of correctly recommended items to the total number of actual positive items.
    - **F1 Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
    - **AUC-ROC:** Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve.
