    ## 3.3 Estimation of the Area

    ### 1. Introduction

    Estimation of the area is a crucial part of the field of geography. It is a statistical process that involves the use of statistical methods to estimate the area of a given set of points.

    ### 2. Methodology

    The methodology for estimating the area involves the following steps:

    1. **Centroid calculation**: The centroid of a polygon is calculated as the average of its vertices.

    2. **Distance calculation**: The distance between two points is calculated using the Haversine formula.

    3. **Area calculation**: The area of a polygon is calculated as the sum of the products of the distances from each point to the centroid and the negative of the cosine of the angle formed by the points.

    ### 3. Python Code

    Here is a simple Python code snippet that calculates the area of a polygon using the centroid and distance methods:

    ```python
    import math

    def calculate_area(points):
        # Calculate the centroid
        centroid = calculate_centroid(points)

        # Initialize the area to 0
        area = 0

        # Loop through each point
        for i in range(len(points)):
            # Calculate the distance to the centroid
            distance = calculate_distance(points[i], centroid)

            # Calculate the area of the triangle formed by the current point and the next point
            area += (distance * distance) / 2

        # Return the area
        return area

    def calculate_centroid(points):
        # Calculate the average of the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates
        centroid_x = sum(point[0] for point in points) / len(points)
        centroid_y = sum(point[1] for point in points) / len(points)

        # Return the centroid
        return (centroid_x, centroid_y)

    def calculate_distance(point1
