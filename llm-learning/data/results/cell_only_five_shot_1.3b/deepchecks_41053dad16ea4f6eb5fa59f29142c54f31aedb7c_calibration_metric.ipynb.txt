The code you provided is already up-to-date. It's a Python script that uses the DeepChecks library to analyze a dataset, and then uses a logistic regression model to classify the dataset. The dataset is a part of the Iris dataset, and it's already updated with the new properties.

The code is divided into two parts:

1. The first part is a code snippet that uses the DeepChecks library to analyze the dataset. The DeepChecks library is a Python library that provides a unified interface for data quality, data transformation, and data analysis.

2. The second part is a code snippet that uses a logistic regression model to classify the dataset. The Iris dataset is used as an example, but the model can be applied to any other dataset.

The code is already up-to-date with the new properties. The new properties include the 'workclass', 'education', 'marital-status', 'occupation', 'relationship', 'race', 'sex', and 'native-country' features. These features are categorical, so the model will be able to classify the data correctly.

The 'native-country' feature is also a categorical feature, but it's not a feature that the model will be able to detect. The model will be able to classify the data correctly, but the 'native-country' feature will not be included in the model's predictions.

The 'native-country' feature is not a feature that the model will be able to detect, but it's included in the dataset, so it's not a problem.
