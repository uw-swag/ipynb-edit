    ### Response:
    The `sklearn.feature_selection` module in Python is used for feature selection. It provides various feature selection methods such as chi-squared test, mutual information, correlation coefficient, etc.

    In the provided code, we use the `SelectKBest` class from `sklearn.feature_selection` to select the top `k` features based on a certain score function. The `f_regression` score function is used here, which computes the F-value for a pair of features.

    The `get_support` method of the `SelectKBest` class returns a boolean array indicating which features were selected.

    The selected features are then printed out.

    The `SelectKBest` class can also be used to select features based on their importance in a machine learning model. This is done by fitting the model to the data and then using the `transform` method to select the features.

    The `SelectKBest` class is a wrapper around the `sk
