    ### Response:
    To add a presentation video, you can use the `IPython.display` module to embed a video from a URL. Here's an example:

    ```python
    from IPython.display import Video

    Video('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ')
    ```

    This will display a YouTube video. You can replace `'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ'` with the URL of the video you want to display.

    Please note that you need to have a YouTube account to access the video.

    Also, please note that the video will be displayed in the notebook itself, not in a separate file. If you want to save the video as a file, you can use the `savefig` function in matplotlib to save the figure as a video.

    Here's an example:

    ```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot([1, 2, 3, 4])
    ax.set_title('Video Title')
    fig.savefig('video.mp4')

    from IPython.display import Video

    Video('video.mp4')
    ```

    This will display the video in the notebook.
