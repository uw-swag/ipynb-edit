    The code you provided is a part of a machine learning model training process in TensorFlow. Here's a brief explanation of the changes:

1. **Data loading**: The code loads a dataset from a time-series manager. The dataset is then prepared and the vocabulary is extracted from it.

2. **Model definition**: A bidirectional LSTM model is defined. The number of layers, state size, and whether or not to return the state is set.

3. **Model training**: The model is trained using the training dataset. The learning rate, number of epochs, and the device to use for training are also set.

The code is quite efficient and should reduce the build time for the PR. However, the exact reduction will depend on the specifics of the build environment and the size of the dataset.
