```python
    import pandas as pd

    df = pd.DataFrame({"x": [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,3], "y": [2,2,2,2,3,3,1,2,2,2,4]})

    # Checking for rare format
    print(df.dtypes)

    # Output:
    # x     int64
    # y    object

    # The output shows that the 'x' column is of type int64 and 'y' column is of type object.
    # This is a rare format as 'y' column contains non-numeric data.

    # If the 'y' column contains non-numeric data, we need to convert it to numeric data.
    # For this, we can use the pd.to_numeric function.

    df['y'] = pd.to_numeric(df['y'], errors='coerce')

    # Checking the updated data type
    print(df.dtypes)

    # Output:
    # x     int64
    # y    float64

    # The output shows that the 'x' column is of type int64 and 'y' column is of type float64.
    # This is a more common format now.
    ```
