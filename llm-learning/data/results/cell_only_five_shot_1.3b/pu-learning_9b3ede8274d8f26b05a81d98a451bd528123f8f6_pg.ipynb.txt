    Here's how you can merge the data processing and existing notebooks:

    The existing notebook is already set up to load the data, process it, and label it. The data processing code is already in the provided cells.

    If you want to merge the data processing and existing notebooks, you can follow these steps:

    1. Open the existing notebook.
    2. Replace the existing data loading and processing code with the new data loading and processing code.
    3. Save and run the notebook.

    The existing notebook will now load the new data, process it, and label it.

    Please note that the existing notebook should be saved in a location where it can be accessed by the new notebook.

    Also, the existing notebook should be saved in a format that can be read by the new notebook. This could be a .ipynb file, a .py file, or any other format that can be read by the new notebook.

    If the existing notebook is a Jupyter notebook, you can use the `%%writefile` magic command to save the notebook as a .py file. For example:

    ```
    %%writefile
    # This is the new notebook
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    from scar import load_scar
    train, valid, test = load_scar()
    x, y, s = train
    from labeling import LabelingMechanism, label_frequency

    def get_sample(data, lm, is_train=False):
        x, y, _ = data
        if is_train:
            lm.fit(x)
        score = lm.propensity_score(x)
        s = (y * (np.random.uniform(size=x.shape[0]) < score)).astype(int)
        return x, y, s
    lm = LabelingMechanism([0,1],[1,1], min_prob=0, max_prob=1)
    train = get_sample(train, lm, is_train=True)
    valid = get_sample(valid, lm)
    test = get_sample(test, lm)
