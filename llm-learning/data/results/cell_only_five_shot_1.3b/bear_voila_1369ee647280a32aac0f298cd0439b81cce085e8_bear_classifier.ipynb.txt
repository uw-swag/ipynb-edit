    This code is used to reset the label value on upload. The function `on_click` is called when the button is clicked. It creates an image from the uploaded file, clears the output of the display, and displays the image. Then, it predicts the image and updates the label value.

    The `observe` function is used to call the `on_click` function when the 'data' name is changed in the `btn_upload` object. The `names=['data']` argument means that the function will be called when the 'data' name is changed in the `btn_upload` object.
