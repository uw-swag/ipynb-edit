    The code you provided is a function for feature extraction from an EEG signal. The function `featureExtraction` takes as input a pandas DataFrame `ndf`, the sample rate of the EEG signal, and the step size to be used for the feature extraction.

    The function first computes the average bandpower of the left and right hemispheres of the EEG signal. It then computes the time domain features such as mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, standard deviation, median, zero cross rate, curtosis, root mean square (RMS), power spectral density (PSD), and sample entropy (SampEn) for each channel.

    The function also computes the frequency domain features such as delta power, theta power, alpha power, beta power, and gamma power for each channel.

    Finally, the function computes the correlation between the left and right hemispheres of the EEG signal. The correlation is computed using the Pearson correlation coefficient.

    The function also computes the most common seizure label for each step in the DataFrame.

    The function returns a new DataFrame `ft` that contains the computed features for each step in the original DataFrame.

    Please note that the function `computeTimeDomainFeatures`, `computeCorrelation`, and `psd` are not defined in the provided code. You need to define these functions according to your requirements.
