```python
    import tensorflow as tf

    # Define a 15c tensor
    tensor_15c = tf.constant([[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]]] * 10, dtype=tf.float32)

    # Print the tensor shape
    print("Tensor Shape: ", tensor_15c.shape)

    # Reshape the tensor to 15c
    tensor_15c = tf.reshape(tensor_15c, [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 15])

    # Print the reshaped tensor shape
    print("Reshaped Tensor Shape: ", tensor_15c.shape)
    ```

    The original code was a 2D tensor with 16c (16 elements) and the reshaped tensor has 15c (15 elements).
