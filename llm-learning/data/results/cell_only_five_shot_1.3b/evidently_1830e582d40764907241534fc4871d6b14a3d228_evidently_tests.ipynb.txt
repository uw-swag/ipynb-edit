    # Replacing FastAPI with Litestar

    FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

    Litestar, on the other hand, is a modern, fast, and efficient web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. It's built on top of Starlette, a high-performance ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) web framework.

    Here's how you can replace FastAPI with Litestar:

    First, you need to install the Litestar library. You can do this by running the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install litestar
    ```

    Then, you can replace your FastAPI code with Litestar code. Here's an example of how you can replace your FastAPI code with Litestar:

    ```python
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    from starlette.responses import JSONResponse

    app = FastAPI()

    @app.get("/")
    def read_root():
        return {"Hello": "World"}

    @app.get("/items/{item_id}")
    def read_item(item_id: int, q: str = None):
        return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}

    @app.post("/items/")
    def create_item(item: dict):
        return item

    @app.put("/items/{item_id}")
    def update_item(item_id: int, item: dict):
        return {"item_id": item_id, "item": item}

    @app.delete("/items/{item_id}")
    def delete_item(item_id: int):
        return {"item_id": item_id}
    ```

    This is a simple example of how you can replace your FastAPI code with Litestar. In this example, we have a single route for each of the HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that you can use to interact with your API.

    Please note that Litestar is a
