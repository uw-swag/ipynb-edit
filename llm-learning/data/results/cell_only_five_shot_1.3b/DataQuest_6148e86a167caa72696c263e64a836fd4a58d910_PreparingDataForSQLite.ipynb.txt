    The code you've provided is a Python script that uses pandas, a powerful data manipulation library, to perform several tasks. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

1. The first part of the code imports the necessary libraries and loads a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.

2. The script then prints the number of rows and columns in the DataFrame.

3. The script then prints the first few rows of the DataFrame.

4. The script then prints the value counts of the 'Unnamed: 5' to 'Unnamed: 10' columns.

5. The script converts the 'Year' column to an integer.

6. The script filters the DataFrame to only include rows where the 'Year' is greater than 2000.

7. The script defines the award categories.

8. The script filters the DataFrame to only include rows where the 'Category' is in the list of award categories.

9. The script adds a new column 'Won' to the DataFrame, where 'YES' is converted to 1 and 'NO' is converted to 0.

10. The script removes the 'Unnamed: 5' to 'Unnamed: 10' columns and the 'Won?' column.

11. The script splits the 'Additional Info' column into two new columns 'Movie' and 'Character'.

12. The script converts the 'Additional Info' column to a string and removes the '}' character.

13. The script converts the 'Movie' and 'Character' columns to strings.

14. The script converts the DataFrame to a SQLite database and inserts the data into a table named 'nominations'.

15. The script prints the table 'nominations' from the SQLite database.

16. The script fetches the first 10 rows from the 'nominations' table in the SQLite database.

Please note that the code is written in a mixed Python and SQLite environment, and it uses SQLite for database operations.
