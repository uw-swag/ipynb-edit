    The code you provided seems to be correct for dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The function `dimentionalityReduction` takes two arguments: `features`, which is a pandas DataFrame containing the features to be reduced, and `pca_tolerance`, which is the number of principal components to retain.

    The function first selects all columns of `features` except the last one, and then fits a PCA model to the selected features. The transformed features are then stored in a new DataFrame `red_ft`. The original 'seizure' column from `features` is also copied to `red_ft`.

    If you're experiencing a bug in PCA, it could be due to several reasons. Here are a few things to check:

    1. Ensure that the features you're using for PCA are numerical. PCA is a technique for dimensionality reduction, and it works best with numerical data.

    2. Check the values in your features DataFrame. If there are any missing values, PCA might fail.

    3. Ensure that the number of principal components you're reducing to is within the acceptable range. PCA is a technique for dimensionality reduction, and it's often used to reduce the number of features in your data.

    4. Check the values in your `pca_tolerance` argument. If it's not an integer, PCA might fail.

    5. If you're using a different PCA implementation, make sure it's compatible with your pandas version.

    If you're still having issues, please provide more information about the bug or the problem you're encountering.
