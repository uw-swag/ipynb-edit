    The code you provided is a part of a larger codebase, and it seems to be related to reinforcement learning, specifically using a deep learning model to train an agent to play a game.

    The code is divided into several sections, each of which is responsible for a specific task. Here's a brief overview of what each section does:

    1. `DQN_Agent`: This class is used to train a deep Q-learning agent. It uses a deep neural network to model the state-action value function, and uses experience replay to learn from the agent's actions.

    2. `REINFORCE_Agent`: This class is used to train a policy gradient method using deep learning. It uses a neural network to model the policy, and uses the advantage of each action to train the model.

    The code also includes a number of helper functions, such as `policy_model`, which is used to set up the model for the policy.

    The code also includes a number of methods, such as `act`, `remember`, `train`, `view`, and `save`, which are used to interact with the agent and to train the agent.

    The code also includes a number of variables, such as `DISCOUNT_RATE`, `EPSILON_DECAY`, `SAMPLE_SIZE`, `RENDER`, `OUTPUT_DIR`, and `N_EPISODES`, which are used to control the behavior of the agent.

    The code also includes a number of global variables, such as `env`, which is used to interact with the game environment.

    The code also includes a number of helper functions, such as `rlplot`, which is used to plot the training progress.

    The code also includes a number of methods, such as `__init__`, `reset`, `increment_time`, `save_score`, `run_episode`, and `score_episode`, which are used to control the agent's behavior.

    The code also includes a number of variables, such as `nstocks`, `ticks_per_episode`, and `learning_rate`, which are used to control the game's parameters.

    The code also
