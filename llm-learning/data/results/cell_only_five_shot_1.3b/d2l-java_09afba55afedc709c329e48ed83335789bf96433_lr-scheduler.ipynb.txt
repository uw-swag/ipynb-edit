    The code you provided is a Maven project configuration for a machine learning project. It uses the Deep Java Library (DJL) to build a model for image classification on the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

    Here's a brief explanation of the changes:

    1. The version of the DJL libraries has been updated from 0.8.0 to 0.11.0. This is a breaking change from 0.8.0, as the 0.11.0 version is a minor update that includes bug fixes and performance improvements.

    2. The `execution_count` metadata in the metadata of the notebook cells has been set to `null` instead of `'null'`. This is a common practice in Jupyter notebooks to avoid displaying the execution count in the notebook.

    3. The `plot-utils`, `Functions.java`, `GradDescUtils.java`, `Accumulator.java`, `StopWatch.java`, `Training.java`, `TrainingChapter11.java`, and `FashionMnistUtils.java` files have been loaded. These are utility classes that are used in the project.

    4. The `train` function has been updated to use the `EasyTrain` class from DJL, which is a high-level API for training models. This is a more efficient and flexible approach compared to the old `Trainer` class.

    5. The `plotMetrics` method has been added to display the training and evaluation metrics.

    6. The `DemoFactorTracker`, `MultiFactorTracker`, and `plotLearningRate` methods have been used to adjust the learning rate based on a factor tracker.

    7. The `train` function has been updated to use the `EasyTrain` class from DJL, which is a high-level API for training models. This is a more efficient and flexible approach compared to the old `Trainer` class.

    8. The `plotMetrics` method has been added to display the training and evaluation metrics.

    9. The `train` function has been updated to use the `EasyTrain` class from DJL, which is a high-level API for training models. This is
