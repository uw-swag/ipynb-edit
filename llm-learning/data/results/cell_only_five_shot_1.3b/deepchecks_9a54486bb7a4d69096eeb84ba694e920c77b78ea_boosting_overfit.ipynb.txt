```
    from deepchecks import Dataset
from deepchecks.checks.methodology.boosting_overfit import BoostingOverfit

train_ds = Dataset(train_df, label='target')
validation_ds = Dataset(val_df, label='target')

# Split the dataset into train and validation
train_ds, validation_ds = train_ds.split(0.8)

# Create a BoostingOverfit check
bof_check = BoostingOverfit(train_ds, validation_ds)

# Run the check
bof_check.run()
    ```

    The above code splits the dataset into 80% for training and 20% for validation. Then, it creates a BoostingOverfit check and runs it on the training dataset.

    The `BoostingOverfit` check is a methodology check that measures the overfitting in a boosting model. It measures the model's ability to make accurate predictions on unseen data.

    The `run` method of the `BoostingOverfit` check returns a report of the check. This report includes the model's performance on the training and validation datasets, and the number of trees used.

    The `split` method of the `Dataset` class is used to split the dataset into a training set and a validation set. The split is done randomly, but you can also use other methods to split the dataset.

    The `Dataset` class is a high-level interface for working with datasets. It provides methods for loading data, performing transformations, and splitting the data.

    The `deepchecks` package is a collection of customizable, reusable, and scalable checks for deep learning and data science.

    The `BoostingOverfit` check is part of the `deepchecks` package.
