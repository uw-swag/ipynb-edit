    The function `mixed_types` checks if the dataframe contains mixed data types. It returns a list of column names that have mixed data types.

    The first call to `mixed_types` checks the first dataframe, and the second call to `mixed_types` checks the second dataframe.

    The function `mixed_types` returns a list of column names that have mixed data types. If there are no mixed data types, the function returns an empty list.

    The function `mixed_types` is a part of the mlchecks library, which is a collection of machine learning checks for data quality.
