```python
    from deepchecks import Dataset
    from deepchecks.checks.methodology.boosting_overfit import BoostingOverfit

    train_ds = Dataset(train_df, label='target')
    validation_ds = Dataset(val_df, label='target')
    from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier

    clf = AdaBoostClassifier(random_state=0)
    clf.fit(train_ds.features_columns, train_ds.label_col)
    BoostingOverfit().run(train_ds, validation_ds, clf)
    ```

    The code above is a Python script that uses the Deepchecks library to perform an overfit check on an AdaBoost classifier. The overfit check is a method used to detect overfitting in machine learning models, which is a common problem in many machine learning algorithms.

    The code first imports the necessary libraries and classes. It then creates a dataset from the training and validation dataframes, and a AdaBoost classifier. The classifier is then trained on the training dataset and the overfit check is run on the training and validation datasets.

    The overfit check returns a report of the results, which can be used to identify overfitting in the model.

    Please note that you need to have the Deepchecks library installed in your Python environment. If not, you can install it using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install deepchecks
    ```

    Also, please replace `train_df`, `val_df`, and `target` with your actual dataframes and target column.
