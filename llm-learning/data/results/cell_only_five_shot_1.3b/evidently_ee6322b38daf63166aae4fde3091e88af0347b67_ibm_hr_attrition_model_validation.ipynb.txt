```python
    import os
    import sys
    sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..')))
    ```
    This code is used to add the parent directory to the system path. This is necessary because the notebook is in the parent directory and we need to import the modules from the parent directory.
