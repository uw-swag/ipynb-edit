The code you provided is a Python script that uses the pandas, evidently, and matplotlib libraries to analyze and visualize data from a CSV file. The script is designed to calculate and visualize the data drift between two weeks of a taxi trip dataset.

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. The script imports necessary libraries and loads the dataset.
2. It then calculates the data drift between the two weeks using the `Dashboard` class from the `evidently` library.
3. The `Dashboard` class is used to create a visualization of the data drift.
4. The script also calculates the statistical test between the two weeks using the `DataDriftOptions` class from the `evidently` library.
5. The script then uses the `TextCommentWidget` class from the `evidently` library to add a text comment widget to the visualization.

The code is well-structured and follows the PEP8 style guide, which is a widely used style guide for Python code.

Please note that the code provided is a simplified example and may not work as expected in a real-world scenario. The code is designed to illustrate the process of data analysis and visualization using the `evidently` library.
