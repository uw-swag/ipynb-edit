    The code you've provided is a complete implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the MNIST dataset using Keras. It includes model training, model evaluation, and model saving.

    The code is divided into several sections, each one responsible for a different task. The first section loads the necessary libraries and data, the next section defines the model architecture, the next section compiles and fits the model, and the last section evaluates and makes predictions.

    The code also includes model evaluation, which calculates the mean accuracy of the model on the test set.

    The code is well-structured and follows good practices for model training and evaluation.
