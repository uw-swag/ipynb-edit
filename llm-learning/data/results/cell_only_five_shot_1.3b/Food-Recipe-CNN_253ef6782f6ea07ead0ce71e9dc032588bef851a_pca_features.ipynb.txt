```python
    import nannyml as nml
    from nannyml.components import ComponentAnalysis
    from nannyml.datasets import load_synthetic_car_loan_dataset

    # Load the synthetic dataset
    reference_df, analysis_df, analysis_targets_df = load_synthetic_car_loan_dataset()

    # Create a component analysis
    component_analysis = ComponentAnalysis(
        reference_df=reference_df,
        analysis_df=analysis_df,
        analysis_targets_df=analysis_targets_df,
        target_names=['target1', 'target2'],
        feature_names=['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3'],
        n_components=2,
        random_state=42
    )

    # Perform the component analysis
    component_analysis.fit()

    # Get the component scores
    component_scores = component_analysis.get_scores()

    # Print the component scores
    print(component_scores)
    ```

    This code will perform a component analysis on the dataset. The `ComponentAnalysis` class from the `nannyml.components` module is used to perform the analysis. The `fit` method is used to perform the analysis, and the `get_scores` method is used to get the component scores. The scores are then printed to the console.
