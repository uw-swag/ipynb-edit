```python
    import seaborn as sns
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Assuming 'data_topProd_states' is a pandas DataFrame
    sns.pairplot(data_topProd_states, hue='state')

    plt.show()
    ```

    This code will generate a pairplot of the data where each variable in the DataFrame is colored by the 'state' column. The KDE plot (kernel density estimate) is used to show the distribution of the data.
