    # File Classification

    This is a markdown file for file classification.

    ## Overview

    The file classification task is a common problem in data science and machine learning. The goal of this task is to classify files into different categories based on their content.

    ## Steps

    1. **Data Preprocessing**: The first step is to preprocess the data. This includes cleaning the data, handling missing values, and converting categorical data into numerical data.

    2. **Feature Extraction**: The next step is to extract features from the data. This could be done using techniques like TF-IDF, word embeddings, or more complex methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

    3. **Model Training**: The final step is to train a model on the preprocessed data. This could be a simple model like a logistic regression, or a more complex model like a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

    4. **Model Evaluation**: After the model is trained, it's evaluated on a separate test set to see how well it performs.

    5. **Model Deployment**: The model is then deployed and used to classify new files.

    ## Conclusion

    This markdown file provides a high-level overview of the file classification task. The steps involved, as well as the results of the evaluation, can be used to inform further research.
