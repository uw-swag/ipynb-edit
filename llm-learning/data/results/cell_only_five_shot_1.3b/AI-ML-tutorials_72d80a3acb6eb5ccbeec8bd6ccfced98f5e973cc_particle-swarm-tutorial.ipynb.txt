    ### Response:
    Here is the code to merge two repositories:

    ```python
    import os
    import shutil

    # Path to the first repository
    repo1_path = "/path/to/repo1"

    # Path to the second repository
    repo2_path = "/path/to/repo2"

    # Create a new directory for the merged repository
    merged_repo_path = "/path/to/merged/repo"

    # Copy all files and directories from repo1 to merged_repo_path
    shutil.copytree(repo1_path, merged_repo_path)

    # Copy all files and directories from repo2 to merged_repo_path
    shutil.copytree(repo2_path, merged_repo_path)
    ```

    This code will create a new directory at the specified path, and then copy all files and directories from the two repositories to the new directory.

    Please replace "/path/to/repo1" and "/path/to/repo2" with the actual paths to your repositories.

    Also, make sure that the paths specified in the code are correct and the directories and files exist in the specified paths.

    If you want to merge the repositories in a specific way, you might need to adjust the code accordingly.
