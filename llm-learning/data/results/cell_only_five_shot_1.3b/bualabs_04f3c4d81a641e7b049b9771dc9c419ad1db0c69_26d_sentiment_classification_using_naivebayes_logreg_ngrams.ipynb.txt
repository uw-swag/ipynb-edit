```python
    from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
    from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB

    # Convert the text to a matrix of token counts
    count_vect = CountVectorizer()
    X_train_counts = count_vect.fit_transform(movie_reviews.train.data)

    # Train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier
    clf = MultinomialNB().fit(X_train_counts, movie_reviews.train.target)

    # Predict the category of a review
    review = "This movie is so great!"
    X_new_counts = count_vect.transform([review])
    prediction = clf.predict(X_new_counts)

    print(prediction)
    ```

    The code above uses the sklearn library to train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier on the movie reviews dataset. It then uses the trained classifier to predict the category of a new review.

    The output of the prediction is the predicted category of the review.

    The code also includes a few additional lines to print the output of the prediction.
