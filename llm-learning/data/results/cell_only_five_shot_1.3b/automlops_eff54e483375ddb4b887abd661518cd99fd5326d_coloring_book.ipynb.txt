    The code you provided is a pipeline for training a model using the Kubeflow Pipelines SDK version 2.0. The pipeline includes three steps:

    1. `create_dataset`: This step reads data from a BigQuery table and saves it as a CSV file in a Google Cloud Storage bucket.

    2. `train_model`: This step trains a decision tree classifier on the data and saves the trained model to a file in a Google Cloud Storage bucket.

    3. `deploy_model`: This step deploys the trained model to an AI Platform endpoint.

    The pipeline parameters are defined in the `pipeline_params` dictionary. The `OneClickMLOps.go` and `OneClickMLOps.generate` functions are used to execute the pipeline.

    Please note that the code is written in Python and uses the Kubeflow Pipelines SDK version 2.0.
