```python
    from deepchecks.checks import SpecialCharacters
    import pandas as pd

    # Create a DataFrame
    df = pd.DataFrame({
        'text': ['Hello, world!', '$$', '@hello', '$$world', '$$hello$$world']
    })

    # Create a SpecialCharacters check
    check = SpecialCharacters(column='text')

    # Run the check
    result = check.run(df)

    # Print the results
    print(result)
    ```

    ### Explanation:
    The `SpecialCharacters` check is a function that checks for special characters in a column of a DataFrame. It's a simple check that doesn't do anything more complex than checking for special characters.

    The `run` method of the `SpecialCharacters` check is used to run the check on a DataFrame. It returns a DataFrame with two columns: 'value' and 'count'. The 'value' column contains the original value from the DataFrame, and the 'count' column contains the number of special characters found.

    The `print` statement at the end of the code will print the results of the check to the console.
