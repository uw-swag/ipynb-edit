    # Chapter 3: Introduction to Python Programming

    ## Section 1: Python Basics

    # Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose dynamic programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation.

    ### Section 2: Python Data Types

    # Python has several built-in data types, the most commonly used are:

    # 1. **Integer**: It is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.
    # 2. **Float**: It is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.
    # 3. **String**: It is a sequence of characters.
    # 4. **Boolean**: It is a data type that has only two values: True and False.

    ### Section 3: Python Control Structures

    # Python supports various control structures to allow programmers to control the flow of their programs. The most common are:

    # 1. **If-Else**: It is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
    # 2. **For**: It is used to iterate over a sequence (that can be a list, tuple, string, or set) or other iterable objects.
    # 3. **While**: It is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.

    ### Section 4: Python Functions

    # Functions in Python are defined using the `def` keyword. A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

    ### Section 5: Python Modules and Packages

    # Python has a built-in module called `math` which provides various mathematical functions. However, you can also create your own modules and packages.

    ### Section 6: Python Standard Library

    # Python comes with a standard library that contains modules for tasks such as network communication, file I/O, operating system calls, and more.

    ### Section 7: Python Error Handling

    # Python uses the try-except-finally structure to handle
