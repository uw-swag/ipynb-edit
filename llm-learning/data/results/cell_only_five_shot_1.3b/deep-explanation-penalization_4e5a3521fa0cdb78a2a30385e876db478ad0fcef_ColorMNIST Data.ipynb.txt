The code you provided is a streamlined process for processing the ISIC dataset. Here's a brief explanation of the changes:

1. **Data Loading**: The code loads the ISIC dataset using the `torchvision.datasets` module. This includes loading the training and testing sets.

2. **Data Augmentation**: The code uses data augmentation techniques to artificially increase the size of the training set. This is done by rotating, scaling, and flipping the images.

3. **Feature Extraction**: The code extracts features from the images using the `torchvision.transforms` module. This includes resizing the images to a standard size and normalizing the pixel values.

4. **Model Training**: The code trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) model on the processed images. The model architecture is a simple CNN with one convolutional layer, one max pooling layer, and one fully connected layer.

5. **Model Evaluation**: The code evaluates the model's performance on the testing set.

6. **Visualization**: The code visualizes the top-10 most likely classes for the training and testing sets.

7. **Probability Plot**: The code calculates the mean probability of each class in the training set and plots it. This is a useful visualization of the model's performance.

Please note that the code provided is a simplified version of the process. In a real-world scenario, you would need to perform additional steps such as data cleaning, model validation, and hyperparameter tuning.
