                                      int batchSize, 
                                      boolean randomShuffle) throws IOException, TranslateException {
        FashionMnist fashionMnist = FashionMnist.builder().optUsage(usage)
                                                      .setSampling(batchSize, randomShuffle)
                                                      .build();
        fashionMnist.prepare();
        return fashionMnist;
    }
    int batchSize = 256;
    boolean randomShuffle = true;

    ArrayDataset mnistTrain = getDataset(Dataset.Usage.TRAIN, batchSize, randomShuffle);
    ArrayDataset mnistTest = getDataset(Dataset.Usage.TEST, batchSize, randomShuffle);

    NDManager manager = NDManager.newBaseManager();
    ```

    The code above is a modification to the original code to ensure that the FashionMnist dataset is used consistently. The `getDataset` method is now called with the `Dataset.Usage.TRAIN` and `Dataset.Usage.TEST` parameters, which ensures that the training and testing datasets are used, respectively. The `batchSize` and `randomShuffle` parameters are also set to their default values, which is 256 for `batchSize` and `true` for `randomShuffle`.
