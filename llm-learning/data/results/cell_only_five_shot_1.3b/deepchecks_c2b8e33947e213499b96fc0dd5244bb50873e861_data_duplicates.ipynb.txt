```python
    # Example 1:
    # This is a simple example of how to use the `show_field` function.
    # The `show_field` function takes a 2D numpy array as input and displays it in a matplotlib figure.
    #
    # The `show_field` function is part of the `viz` module, which is not included in the original code.
    # You need to install the `viz` module to use this function.
    #
    # Here is an example of how to use the `show_field` function:
    from viz import show_field

    Y = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
    show_field(Y)

    # Example 2:
    # This is a simple example of how to use the `make_move` function.
    # The `make_move` function takes a 2D numpy array and a move as input and returns a new numpy array with the move applied.
    #
    # The `make_move` function is part of the `tools` module, which is not included in the original code.
    # You need to install the `tools` module to use this function.
    #
    # Here is an example of how to use the `make_move` function:
    from tools import make_move

    Y = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
    move = (1, 0)  # move to the right
    Y_new = make_move(Y, move)
    print(Y_new)
    ```
