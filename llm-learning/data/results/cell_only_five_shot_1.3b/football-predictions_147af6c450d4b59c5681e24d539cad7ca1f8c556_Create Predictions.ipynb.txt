    ## Code Explanation
    The code is divided into several sections.

    - The first section reads the data from a CSV file.
    - The second section drops columns with missing values.
    - The third section drops rows with missing values.
    - The fourth section sorts the data by 'season'.
    - The fifth section appends the fixtures data to the existing data.
    - The sixth section resets the index of the data.
    - The seventh section assigns a unique 'gameId' to each row.

    The final data frame, `df_ema`, is then used for further analysis or modeling.
