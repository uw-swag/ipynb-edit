The code you provided is for a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on GoogleNet. However, it's not clear what the issue is.

The code is using a single GPU for training. The line `NDManager manager = NDManager.newBaseManager();` is creating a new instance of the NDManager, which is used to manage the computation graph.

The line `model.setBlock(block);` is setting the model's block to the provided block.

The line `Trainer trainer = model.newTrainer(config);` is creating a new trainer for the model.

The line `NDArray X = manager.randomUniform(0f, 1.0f, new Shape(1, 1, 96, 96));` is initializing the input to the model.

The line `trainer.initialize(X.getShape());` is initializing the model with the input shape.

The code seems to be fine and should work fine on a single GPU. If you're encountering any issues, please provide more details about the error or the issue you're facing.
