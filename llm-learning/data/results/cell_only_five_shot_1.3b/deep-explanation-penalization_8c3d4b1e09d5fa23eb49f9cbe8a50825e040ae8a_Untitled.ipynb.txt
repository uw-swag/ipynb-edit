1. The code is not provided, but it seems to be a PyTorch implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the MNIST dataset. The code includes a class `Net` that defines a CNN with two convolutional layers, followed by two fully connected layers. The `train` and `test` functions are used to train and test the model, respectively. The `main` function is the entry point of the program, and it sets up the training and testing data loaders, creates the model, and then trains and tests the model.
