```python
    # Example 1:
    # Suppose we have a list of numbers and we want to find the sum of all numbers in the list.

    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    sum_of_numbers = sum(numbers)
    print(sum_of_numbers)

    # Example 2:
    # Suppose we have a list of strings and we want to find the length of the longest string in the list.

    strings = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
    longest_string_length = max(len(string) for string in strings)
    print(longest_string_length)

    # Example 3:
    # Suppose we have a list of tuples and we want to sort the list based on the second element of each tuple.

    tuples = [(1, "banana"), (2, "apple"), (3, "cherry")]
    sorted_tuples = sorted(tuples, key=lambda x: x[1])

    # Example 4:
    # Suppose we have a list of dictionaries and we want to sort the list based on the value of a specific key.

    dictionaries = [{"name": "John", "age": 28}, {"name": "Jane", "age": 22}, {"name": "Bob", "age": 33}]
    sorted_dictionaries = sorted(dictionaries, key=lambda x: x["age"])
