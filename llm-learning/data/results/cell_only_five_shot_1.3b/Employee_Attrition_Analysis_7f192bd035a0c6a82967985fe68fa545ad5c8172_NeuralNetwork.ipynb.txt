    The code you provided is a complete implementation of a deep learning model using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning library. The model is a simple neural network with three hidden layers. The model is trained on the preprocessed training data and then evaluated on the preprocessed testing data.

    The model is trained for 500 epochs, which is a common number for training deep learning models. The model's performance is evaluated using the test data, and the loss and accuracy of the model are printed to the console.

    The model's performance is evaluated using the test data, and the loss and accuracy of the model are printed to the console.
