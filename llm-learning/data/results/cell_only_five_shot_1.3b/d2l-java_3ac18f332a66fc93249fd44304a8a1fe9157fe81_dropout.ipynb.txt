    The issue seems to be with the convergence of the model. The model might be getting stuck in a local minimum, which is not a good practice. You can try to increase the number of epochs or use a different optimizer.

    Here is the modified code:

    ```java
    int numEpochs = 100;
    int trainIter = 100;
    int testIter = 100;

    // ...

    try (Model model = Model.newInstance("mlp")) {
        model.setBlock(net);

        try (Trainer trainer = model.newTrainer(config)) {

            trainer.initialize(new Shape(1, 784));
            trainer.setMetrics(new Metrics());

            for (int i = 0; i < numEpochs; i++) {
                trainer.fit(trainIter, testIter);
            }

            Metrics metrics = trainer.getMetrics();

            // ...
        }
    }
    ```

    This should help to solve the issue of the model getting stuck in a local minimum.
