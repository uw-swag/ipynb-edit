    ## Describe Train, Infer and Conclusion

    ### Train
    The training process involves the use of machine learning algorithms to learn from the data. In the context of medical imaging, this could involve the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify patterns in the images. The training data is a set of images of patients with pneumothorax, along with their corresponding labels.

    ### Infer
    Once the model has been trained, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. In the context of medical imaging, this could involve the use of the model to identify the presence of pneumothorax in new images.

    ### Conclusion
    The results of the training, inference, and conclusion sections show that the model was able to accurately identify the presence of pneumothorax in medical images. This could be useful in the field of medical imaging, where pneumothorax is a significant problem.
