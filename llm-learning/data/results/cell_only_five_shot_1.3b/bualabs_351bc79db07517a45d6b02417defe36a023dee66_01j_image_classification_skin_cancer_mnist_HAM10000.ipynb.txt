    The code above is a modification to the original code. The code is now using the `kornia` library, which is a Keras-like library for deep learning, to add progressive resizing and the Ranger optimizer. The `kornia` library is a part of the `fastai2` library, which is a fastai2 extension for PyTorch.

    The `fastai2` library is a fastai2 extension for PyTorch, which is a fastai2 extension for PyTorch. It provides a set of tools and functionalities to build and train state-of-the-art deep learning models.
