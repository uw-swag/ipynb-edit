    The code you provided is used to handle skewed data in a machine learning model. It uses the log1p function to transform skewed data into a more normal-looking form. The skew is defined as a value that is greater than 0.75. If a feature has a skew greater than 0.75, it is considered skewed and is transformed using the log1p function.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The code first identifies the numeric features in the training and test datasets.
    - It then calculates the skewness of each numeric feature in the training and test datasets.
    - It filters out the skewed features that have a skewness greater than 0.75.
    - It then applies the log1p function to the skewed features in the training and test datasets.
    - The log1p function transforms the skewed data into a more normal-looking form.

    Please note that this code assumes that the skewness of a feature is calculated using the skew function from the scipy.stats module. If you're using a different method for calculating skewness, you'll need to adjust the code accordingly.

    Also, this code does not handle missing values. If your dataset contains missing values, you'll need to handle them appropriately before applying this code.
