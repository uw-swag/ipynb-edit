    The code you provided is a Python script that uses the sklearn library to train a RandomForestRegressor model on a dataset. The script then uses the evidently library to create a dashboard that displays the performance of the model.

    The dashboard includes several tabs, including:

    - A tab for the regression performance of the model.
    - A tab for the data drift analysis.
    - A tab for the time series widget, which allows the user to view the target variable ('cnt') with a range slider.

    The script also uses the plotly library to create a line plot of the target variable over time.

    The code is updated to include a new tab for time series widgets, and a new range slider widget for the 'temp' feature.

    The script also includes a new line of code to save the dashboard as an HTML file.

    The code is also updated to include a new range slider widget for the 'hum' feature.
