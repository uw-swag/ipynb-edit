    # Data preprocessing
    # This is a placeholder for your actual preprocessing steps
    # For example, you might need to handle missing values, outliers, or normalize/standardize the data

    # Feature Engineering
    # This is a placeholder for your actual feature engineering steps
    # For example, you might need to create new features, encode categorical variables, or normalize numerical variables

    # Modeling
    # This is a placeholder for your actual modeling steps
    # For example, you might need to split the data into training and testing sets,
    # train a model, evaluate it, or make predictions

    # Evaluation
    # This is a placeholder for your actual evaluation steps
    # For example, you might need to calculate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score

    # Conclusion
    # This is a placeholder for your actual conclusion steps
    # For example, you might need to summarize the results, discuss the implications, or suggest future directions
