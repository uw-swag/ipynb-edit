    The code you provided is a Java code snippet for a machine learning model training process. The model is a linear regression model, and the training process involves calculating the loss (error) and the gradient of the loss with respect to the model parameters.

    Here are some refactoring suggestions:

    1. **Remove unnecessary imports**: The code imports a lot of libraries, but it's not used anywhere in the code. You can remove these imports to reduce the size of the code.

    2. **Use meaningful variable names**: The variable names `trainLoss`, `testLoss`, `epochCount` are not descriptive. You can use more descriptive names like `trainingLoss`, `testLossValues`, `epochCounts`.

    3. **Remove unnecessary code**: The code inside the `for` loop is not used. You can remove this part to reduce the size of the code.

    4. **Use meaningful function names**: The function `initParams`, `NDList`, `Training`, `l2Penalty`, `Training.linreg`, `Training.squaredLoss`, `Training.sgd` are not descriptive. You can use more descriptive names like `initializeParams`, `createNDList`, `calculateLoss`, `calculateGradient`, `updateWeights`.

    5. **Use meaningful comments**: The comments inside the code are not clear. You can use more descriptive comments to explain what the code does.

    6. **Use meaningful exception handling**: The code uses `try-catch` blocks to handle exceptions. You can use more descriptive exception messages to explain what the exception is for.

    7. **Use meaningful loop variables**: The loop variables `epoch`, `batch`, `X`, `y`, `w`, `b`, `l` are not descriptive. You can use more descriptive names like `epochIndex`, `batchIndex`, `inputData`, `outputData`, `weight`, `bias`, `loss`.

    8. **Use meaningful constants**: The constants `0.003f`, `0.7f`,
