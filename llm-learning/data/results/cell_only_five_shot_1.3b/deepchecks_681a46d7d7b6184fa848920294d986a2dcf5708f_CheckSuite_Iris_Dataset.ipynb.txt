    Here is the updated code:

    ```python
    from deepchecks.suites import overall_check_suite
    OverallSuite = overall_check_suite()
    from deepchecks import CheckSuite
    from deepchecks.checks import *
    MyModelSuite = CheckSuite('Suite For Model Performance',
        ModelInfo(),
        PerformanceReport(),
        TrainTestDifferenceOverfit(),
        ConfusionMatrixReport(),
        SimpleModelComparison(simple_model_type='constant').add_condition_ratio_not_less_than(0.9)
    )
    ```

    The commit message "Renaming checksuite to suite (#206)" is updated to reflect the change. The original code was "from deepchecks.suites import overall_check_suite", which was renamed to "OverallSuite".
