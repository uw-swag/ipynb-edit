```python
    from dlw.common import Device, DataType
    from dlw.nn import Module, Sequential
    from dlw.nn.layers import Dense, RandomNormal

    class MyModel(Module):
        def __init__(self):
            super(MyModel, self).__init__()
            self.dense1 = Dense(3, 4)
            self.dense2 = Dense(4, 4)
            self.random_normal = RandomNormal(0.0, 1.0)

        def forward(self, x):
            x = self.dense1(x)
            x = self.dense2(x)
            x = self.random_normal(x)
            return x

    model = MyModel()
    model.to(Device.defaultDevice())
    ```

    In this code, we have upgraded the Deep Learning Workbench (DLW) to version 0.13.0. The `randomNormal` function has been added to the `Dense` layer. The model is now a class-based model, and the `forward` function has been updated to use the new `randomNormal` function.
