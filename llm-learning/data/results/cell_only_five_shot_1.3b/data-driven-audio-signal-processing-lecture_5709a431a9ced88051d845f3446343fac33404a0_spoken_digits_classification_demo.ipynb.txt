```python
    import tensorflow as tf
    from tensorflow.keras import layers

    # Define a simple sequential model
    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential()

    # Add a Dense layer with 10 units and 'relu' activation function
    model.add(layers.Dense(10, activation='relu'))

    # Add another Dense layer with 10 units and 'relu' activation function
    model.add(layers.Dense(10, activation='relu'))

    # Compile the model with 'adam' optimizer and 'categorical_crossentropy' loss function
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')

    # Fit the model with dummy data
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

    # Evaluate the model on the test data
    model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)

    # Predict the labels of the test data
    y_pred = model.predict(x_test)
    ```
    This code creates a simple feed-forward neural network using TensorFlow's Keras API. The network consists of two Dense layers, each with 10 units and 'relu' activation function. The model is compiled with 'adam' optimizer and 'categorical_crossentropy' loss function, which is suitable for multi-class classification problems. The model is then trained for 10 epochs on the training data, and its performance is evaluated on the test data. Finally, the model's predictions are made on the test data.
