    The error in the inference test set is likely due to the fact that the model is not properly trained and the data is not properly prepared for inference. 

    Here are a few things you can check:

    1. Make sure that the data is properly loaded and preprocessed before the model is used for inference.
    2. Check if the model is properly trained and the learning rate is correctly set.
    3. Ensure that the model is using the correct loss function and optimizer.
    4. Check if the model is using the correct device (CPU or GPU) for training and inference.
    5. If the model is using a custom loss function, make sure that it is correctly defined and compatible with the data.

    If you're still facing the issue, please provide more details about the error message or the specific part of the code that's causing the problem.
