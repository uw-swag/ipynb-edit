    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that includes several exercises and solutions for chapter 4 of a book. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    1. The first part of the code imports necessary libraries and modules.

    2. The code then defines a function to calculate the Euclidean distance between two points.

    3. The code then creates a random dataset with 100 instances and 1 feature.

    4. The code then trains a linear regression model on the dataset and calculates the mean squared error of the model's predictions.

    5. The code then plots the learning curves of a linear regression model.

    6. The code then creates a pipeline that transforms the input data and then trains a logistic regression model.

    7. The code then uses a logistic regression model to predict the probabilities of the classes of the Iris dataset.

    8. The code then plots the decision boundary of a logistic regression model.

    9. The code then creates a softmax regression model and plots the decision regions of the model.

    The code is designed to be interactive and to be easily modified to include more exercises and solutions.
