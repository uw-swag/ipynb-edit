    The original code is using a Logistic Regression classifier to classify data from the 'scar' dataset. However, it seems like there's a typo in the code. The classifier should be a non-traditional classifier like Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Neural Networks.

    Here's an example of how you can use a non-traditional classifier, Decision Trees, to classify the same data:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Load the iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Create a Decision Tree classifier
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=0)

# Train the classifier
clf.fit(X, y)

# Use the classifier to predict the labels of the data
y_pred = clf.predict(X)

# Print the accuracy of the classifier
print("Accuracy:", clf.score(X, y))
```

In this example, we're using the iris dataset, which is a classic dataset for classification tasks. The classifier is a Decision Tree, and we're training it on the data and then using it to predict the labels of the data. The accuracy of the classifier is also printed.

Please replace the classifier with the non-traditional classifier of your choice.
