    The code you provided is a complete implementation of a reinforcement learning agent in Python using the OpenAI Gym library. It includes the definition of the `Agent` class, the `run_experiment` function, and the usage of the `Experiment` class from Comet ML.

    The agent is trained to perform the CartPole-v1 environment, which is a classic reinforcement learning problem. The agent uses a deep Q-network (DQN) with experience replay and a logistic policy to learn the optimal policy. The agent is trained for 2000 episodes and logs the results of each episode.

    The code also includes a ReinforceBaseline agent, which is a simple baseline agent that uses a linear model to predict the state-action value function. The agent is trained for 5000 episodes and logs the results of each episode.

    Finally, the code includes a usage example of the trained agent in action.

    Please note that the code provided is a basic implementation and may need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of your project.
