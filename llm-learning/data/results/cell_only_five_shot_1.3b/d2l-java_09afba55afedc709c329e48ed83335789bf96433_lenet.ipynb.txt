    The code you provided is a TensorFlow 2.0 advanced tutorial. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    1. The code imports necessary libraries and modules.
    2. It loads the Fashion MNIST dataset from TensorFlow's datasets module.
    3. The dataset is normalized and split into training and testing sets.
    4. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is defined and compiled.
    5. The model is trained for 10 epochs using the training data.
    6. The model's performance is evaluated on the test data.
    7. The code also creates a line plot to visualize the training and testing loss and accuracy over epochs.

    Please note that the code is written in Python and uses the TensorFlow 2.0 library. The code is for a basic understanding of TensorFlow and CNNs. For a more advanced understanding, you may need to delve deeper into the code and the specific libraries and modules used.
