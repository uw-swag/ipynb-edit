    This module contains the functions for performing action recognition on video data.

    ## Functions

    - `init_model(sample_length, base_model)`: Initializes the model for action recognition.
    - `predict_video_frames(video_filepath, d_video, d_caption)`: Predicts actions in a video frame by frame.
    - `evaluation(model, generator, data)`: Evaluates the model on a given dataset.
    - `plot_metrices(history)`: Plots the metrics of the model.
    - `submission_categorical(model)`: Generates a submission file for categorical classification.
    - `submission_binary(model)`: Generates a submission file for binary classification.
    - `model_metrics()`: Returns a list of model metrics.
    - `make_model1(metrics)`: Creates a model with one convolutional layer.
    - `make_model2(metrics)`: Creates a model with two convolutional layers.
    - `plotImages(images_arr)`: Plots images in a grid.

    ## Models

    - `R2Plus1D`: A model for action recognition.
    - `VideoLearner`: A model for action recognition.

    ## References

    - `transforms_video`: A module for video transformations.
    - `KINETICS`: A module for Kinetics dataset.

    This documentation provides a detailed explanation of the functions, models, and references used in the action recognition module.
    """
    ## Note

    The `transforms_video` and `KINETICS` modules are not included in this documentation as they are not part of the standard library. They are custom modules developed for the specific task of action recognition.
    """
    ## Warnings

    - This module is a work in progress and may not cover all edge cases.
    - The performance of the model may vary depending on the specifics of the video data.
    - The model's performance may be improved by training it on a diverse range of video data.
