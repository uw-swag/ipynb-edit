    - **Supports Multiple Models**: Vision supports a wide range of machine learning models, including linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks.
    - **Flexible Hyperparameter Tuning**: Vision provides a flexible and powerful hyperparameter tuning system, allowing users to easily find the best hyperparameters for their model.
    - **Integration with Scikit-Learn**: Vision integrates with the Scikit-Learn library, making it easy to use in conjunction with Scikit-Learn.

    ### Installation

    Vision can be installed using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install vision
    ```

    ### Usage

    Vision provides a simple and intuitive way to build and train machine learning models. Here's a basic example of how to use Vision:

    ```python
    from vision import Vision
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

    # Load the iris dataset
    iris = load_iris()
    X = iris.data
    y = iris.target

    # Split the dataset into a training set and a test set
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
