```python
    # This is the updated folder structure
    # root
    # |-- chapter_1
    # |-- chapter_2
    # |-- chapter_3
    # |-- chapter_4
    # |-- chapter_5
    # |-- chapter_6
    # |-- notebooks
    # |-- data
    # |-- images
    # |-- libraries
    # |-- scripts
    # |-- README.md
    ```
    The folder structure is now organized in a way that makes it easy to navigate and find the different files and folders.
