    The issue seems to be with the link to the Cross Entropy Loss function on the Bua Labs website. The link is not properly formatted and the function name is not spelled correctly.

    Here's the corrected code:

    ```python
    from keras.losses import categorical_crossentropy

    # Define the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    ```

    This code will correctly link to the Cross Entropy Loss function in Keras.

    Please note that the function name in Keras is 'categorical_crossentropy', not 'cross_entropy_loss'.

    Also, the link to the Cross Entropy Loss function on the Bua Labs website should be updated to reflect this change.

    If the issue persists, please provide more context or the specific error message you're receiving.
