    The code you've provided is a mix of Python and Jupyter notebook code. It's not a single code cell, but a set of code blocks. 

    Here's a brief explanation of what each part of the code does:

    1. Importing necessary libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `pandas`.

    2. Defining a class `LinearRegression`: This class is used to perform linear regression on a dataset. It has methods for computing the cost function, performing gradient descent, making predictions, and using the normal equation.

    3. Defining a class `FeatureScaling`: This class is used to perform feature scaling on a dataset. It has methods for transforming the data, inverting the transformations, and returning the original data.

    4. Defining a dictionary `dummy_data1` and `dummy_data2`: These are dictionaries that are used to create pandas DataFrames.

    5. Merging `dummy_data1` and `dummy_data2`: This line of code merges `dummy_data1` and `dummy_data2` on the 'Category' and 'Market' columns, using a 'left' join.

    6. Plotting a scatter plot of the dataset.

    The code is not complete and does not run as expected because it contains a lot of commented out code and it's not clear what the purpose of each part of the code is.
