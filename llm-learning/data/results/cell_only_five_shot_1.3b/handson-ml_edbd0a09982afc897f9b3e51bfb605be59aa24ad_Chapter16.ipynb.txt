    # Chapter 16: Functions and Modules

    # WIP: Chapter 16

    ## 16.1: Defining Functions

    # Functions are reusable pieces of code that perform a specific task. They can be defined in Python using the `def` keyword.

    def function_name(parameters)::
        # function body

    ## 16.2: Calling Functions

    # Functions can be called using the `call_function()` function.

    function_name(parameters)

    ## 16.3: Modules and Packages

    # Modules and packages are collections of functions, variables, and other elements that can be imported and used in other Python programs.

    ## 16.4: Built-in Functions

    # Python has a built-in set of functions that can be used to perform common tasks.

    ## 16.5: Defining and Using Classes

    # Classes are a blueprint for creating objects. They can be defined using the `class` keyword.

    class ClassName:
        # class body

    ## 16.6: Inheritance

    # Inheritance is a mechanism that allows you to create new classes from existing classes.

    class ChildClass(ParentClass):
        # child class body

    ## 16.7: Exception Handling

    # Exception handling is a mechanism to catch and handle the runtime errors.

    try:
        # code that may raise an exception
    except Exception as e:
        # code to handle the exception

    ## 16.8: File I/O

    # File I/O is a method for reading and writing data to files.

    with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
        # read data from the file

    with open('file.txt', 'w') as file:
        # write data to the file

    ## 16.9: Decorators

    # Decorators are a way to modify the behavior of a function, method, or class.

    @decorator
    def function_name(parameters):
