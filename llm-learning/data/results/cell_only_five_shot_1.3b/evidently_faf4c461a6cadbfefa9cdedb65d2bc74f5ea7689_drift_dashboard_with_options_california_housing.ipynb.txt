    ## Examples reorganisation and moving GitBook docs to repo

    This commit is about reorganizing the examples and moving the GitBook documentation to the repository.

    ### Reorganizing the examples

    The examples were originally in a separate folder, but it was not clear how to structure them in the repository. This commit will help to reorganize the examples into a more structured way.

    ### Moving the GitBook documentation

    The GitBook documentation is currently in a separate location, but it's not clear where it's stored. This commit will help to move the documentation to the repository.

    ### Steps to follow

    1. Navigate to the `docs` directory in the repository.
    2. Rename the `GitBook.md` file to `README.md`.
    3. Commit the changes.

    ### Code Changes

    The code changes are as follows:

    ```markdown
    ## README.md

    ## Examples

    - [Example 1](example1.md)
    - [Example 2](example2.md)
    - [Example 3](example3.md)

    ## GitBook Documentation

    - [GitBook Documentation](GitBook.md)
    ```

    This is a basic structure for the README file and the GitBook documentation. The actual content of the files will depend on the specific examples and documentation.

    ### Conclusion

    This commit will help to make the examples and documentation more organized and easier to find.
