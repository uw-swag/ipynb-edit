    ## Perceptron

    A Perceptron is a type of artificial neural network that consists of a single layer of nodes, where each node is connected to every other node. The output of a perceptron is a binary output, either 0 or 1.

    ## Installation

    You can install the perceptron library using pip:

    ```python
    pip install perceptron
    ```

    ## Usage

    Here is a simple example of how to use the perceptron library:

    ```python
    from perceptron import Perceptron

    # Create a perceptron with 3 input nodes and 1 output node
    perceptron = Perceptron(3, 1)

    # Train the perceptron
    perceptron.train([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1]],
                     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1])

    # Predict the output for a new input
    print(perceptron.predict([0, 1, 1]))
    ```
