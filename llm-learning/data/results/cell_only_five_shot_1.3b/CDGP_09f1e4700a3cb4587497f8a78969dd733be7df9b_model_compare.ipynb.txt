    It seems like you're trying to implement a question answering system using BERT models. The code you've provided is a part of a larger system that uses BERT models to answer questions from a set of distractors.

    The code is divided into several sections:

    1. Importing necessary libraries and modules.
    2. Loading the BERT models and tokenizers.
    3. Defining the questions and their distractors.
    4. Using the BERT models to answer the questions.
    5. Printing the results.

    The code is a good starting point for a question answering system using BERT models. However, there are a few improvements that can be made:

    1. The code is currently set to only answer the first question in the set. You might want to modify the code to answer all questions in the set.
    2. The code is currently not handling the case where the answer is not in the distractors list. You might want to add a check to ensure the answer is in the distractors list.
    3. The code is currently not handling the case where the answer is not in the first three BERT models' answer lists. You might want to add a check to ensure the answer is in the first three answer lists.

    Please let me know if you need help with these improvements.
