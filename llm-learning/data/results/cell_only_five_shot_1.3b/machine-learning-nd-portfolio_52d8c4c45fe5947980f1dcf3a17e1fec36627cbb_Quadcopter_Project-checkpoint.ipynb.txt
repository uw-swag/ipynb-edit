    ### Response:
    Here is an example of how you can add a new Jupyter notebook.

    ```python
    # Add a new notebook
    # Create a new notebook
    !jupyter notebook create 'My First Notebook'

    # Navigate to the new notebook
    !jupyter notebook 'My First Notebook'
    ```

    This will create a new notebook named 'My First Notebook' in the current directory. You can then add your code and data to this notebook.

    Please replace 'My First Notebook' with the name you want for your notebook.
