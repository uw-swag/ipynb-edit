    ### Solution:
    Here is a simple solution to the problem of adding a Python code to a Chipotle's menu.

    The solution is to add a new item to the menu with a price.

    Here is the Python code:

    ```python
    class MenuItem:
        def __init__(self, name, price, description, category):
            self.name = name
            self.price = price
            self.description = description
            self.category = category

    class Menu:
        def __init__(self):
            self.menu_items = []

        def add_item(self, item):
            self.menu_items.append(item)

    # Create a new menu item
    new_item = MenuItem("New Item", 10.0, "This is a new item", "New Item")

    # Add the new item to the menu
    my_menu = Menu()
    my_menu.add_item(new_item)
    ```

    This code creates a `MenuItem` class that represents an item in the menu. Each item has a name, price, description, and category. The `Menu` class represents the entire menu, and it has a method to add items to the menu.

    The code then creates a new menu item, adds it to the menu, and prints out the menu items.

    Please note that this is a very simple solution and a real-world application would likely involve more complex data structures and methods.
