    The provided code is a simple implementation of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) using TensorFlow. The DNN is a single-layer neural network with one hidden layer. The hidden layer has 30 neurons and uses the sigmoid activation function. The output layer has one neuron and uses the linear activation function. The model is trained using the mean squared error (MSE) loss function and the Adam optimizer.

    The function approximation capabilities of DNNs are a key aspect of DNNs. In the context of machine learning, function approximation is a method of approximating a function by a neural network. This is often used in the field of machine learning for tasks that are computationally expensive or require a large number of parameters.

    In the provided code, the SURF (Support Vector Regression) algorithm is not used. SURF is a method for regression that uses support vectors to estimate the output. This is a more advanced technique and is not typically used in the context of DNNs.

    The code also uses a single-layer neural network, but it could be extended to a multi-layer network if needed. The number of layers and the number of neurons in each layer can be adjusted to improve the performance of the model.

    The code also uses a single-variable linear regression model, but it could be extended to a multi-variable linear regression model if needed. The number of variables and the number of neurons in each layer can be adjusted to improve the performance of the model.
