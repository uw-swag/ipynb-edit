    ### Response:
    The code cells you provided are complete and ready to be executed. They import necessary libraries, define the necessary functions, and set up the environment for the subsequent steps.

    Please note that the code cells are written in Python and are using the scikit-learn library for machine learning tasks. The CountVectorizer class is used to convert text data into a matrix of token counts, and the MultinomialNB class is a simple and fast implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm.

    The code also includes a simple train-test split for the data, and a basic classification report and accuracy score are generated.

    The final code cell is empty, as it is not performing any action.

    Please provide the next set of instructions or the next set of code cells for further assistance.
