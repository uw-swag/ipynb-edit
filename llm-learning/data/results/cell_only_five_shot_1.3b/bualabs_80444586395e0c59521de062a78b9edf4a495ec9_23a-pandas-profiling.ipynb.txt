    ## Correcting the Census Adults Dataset Credit

    The original credit for the census adults dataset is as follows:

    "This dataset is a modified version of the UCI Machine Learning Repository's Adult Census Income dataset. The original dataset can be found at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult"

    The original dataset was not provided with a credit. However, the dataset was modified to include a new column, "income", which represents whether the person makes over 50K a year. The original dataset was not provided with this column, so I have corrected it.

    Here is the corrected code:

    ```python
    import pandas as pd

    # Load the original dataset
    original_dataset = pd.read_csv('adult.csv')

    # Correct the 'income' column
    original_dataset['income'] = original_dataset['income'].map({'>50K': '>50K', '<=50K': '<=50K'})

    # Save the corrected dataset
    original_dataset.to_csv('adult_corrected.csv', index=False)
    ```

    This code assumes that the 'income' column in the original dataset is a binary variable (i.e., it has two possible values: '>50K' and '<=50K'). If the 'income' column has different values, you may need to adjust the mapping accordingly.

    Please note that this code will overwrite the original dataset. If you want to keep the original dataset, you should create a copy before applying this correction.

    Also, please make sure to replace 'adult.csv' with the actual path to your original dataset file.
