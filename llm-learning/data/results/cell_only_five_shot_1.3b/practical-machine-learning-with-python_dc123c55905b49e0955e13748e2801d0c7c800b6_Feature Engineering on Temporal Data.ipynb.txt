The code you provided is using Git Large File Storage (Git LFS) to store large files in Git. Git LFS is a system for versioning large files. It's a way to store and access large files in a Git repository.

However, in your code, you're not using Git LFS. Git LFS is a Git extension that allows you to store and access large files in a Git repository. It's not a part of the standard Git workflow.

If you want to remove Git LFS, you can do so by removing the import statements for the `git` and `lfs` modules. Here's how you can do it:

```python
# Removing import statements for git and lfs
# ...

# Now, your code should work without Git LFS
# ...
```

Please note that this will not remove the files that are being stored in Git LFS. The files will still exist in your local system, but they will not be versioned in Git.
