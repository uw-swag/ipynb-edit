The code you've provided is a part of a PyTorch Lightning (PL) workflow for training a model. Here's a brief explanation of the changes:

1. `tfms`: This is a tuple of transformations that will be applied to the input data during training. The transformations include flipping the images vertically, rotating them, zooming them, warping them, and potentially lighting them.

2. `learn.TTA(ds_type=DatasetType.Test, scale=1.2)`: This is a method from PyTorch Lightning that applies test time augmentation (TTA) to the predictions of the model. TTA is a technique used to improve the performance of a model by using a separate validation set to generate a set of augmented examples.

3. `preds.shape`: This line of code is used to print the shape of the predictions. The shape of the predictions is (batch_size, num_classes).

4. The learning rate and metrics are added to the model's configuration. The learning rate is set to 0.01 and the metrics are set to accuracy and F1-score.

Please note that the code you've provided is a part of a PyTorch Lightning workflow, and it's not a typical PyTorch code. If you're working with PyTorch, you might want to consider using PyTorch Lightning for your model training.
