    The code you've provided is a guided project for predicting car prices using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression. Here's a breakdown of the code:

    1. The first part of the code imports necessary libraries and loads the dataset. It also replaces missing values with NaN and converts the data type to float.

    2. The next part of the code checks the percentage of values that are not numeric.

    3. The next part of the code removes any rows with missing 'price' values.

    4. The next part of the code normalizes the data by dividing each column by its maximum value.

    5. The next part of the code trains a KNN model for each feature in the dataset. The model is trained on a 75% of the data and tested on the remaining 25%.

    6. The last part of the code trains a KNN model for each feature in the dataset and calculates the mean squared error for each model. The mean squared error is a measure of how well the model's predictions match the actual values.

    The final part of the code creates a dictionary where the keys are the feature names and the values are the mean squared errors for each feature.

    The code is designed to be run in a Jupyter notebook or a Python script.
