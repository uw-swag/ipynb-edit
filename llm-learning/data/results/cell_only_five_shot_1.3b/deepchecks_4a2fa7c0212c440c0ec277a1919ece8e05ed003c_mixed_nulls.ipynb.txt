    ## Introduction

    This document describes the process of solving the Titanic: Machine Learning from Kaggle.

    ## Data Description

    The dataset used in this project is the Titanic: Machine Learning from Kaggle. It contains information about the passengers on the Titanic, including their age, sex, passenger class, fare, and whether or not they survived.

    ## Data Preprocessing

    The dataset was preprocessed by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and encoding categorical variables.

    ## Feature Engineering

    Features were engineered to improve the model's performance. For example, the 'Age' feature was engineered to fill missing values, and the 'Fare' feature was engineered to create a new feature that represents the total fare.

    ## Model Training

    A variety of models were trained to predict whether or not a passenger survived the Titanic. The models used included logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting.

    ## Model Evaluation

    The models were evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The model with the highest accuracy was selected as the final model.

    ## Model Optimization

    The final model was optimized by tuning hyperparameters. The hyperparameters used were the learning rate, number of estimators, and max depth of the random forest.

    ## Conclusion

    The final model, based on the highest accuracy, was used to predict whether or not a passenger survived the Titanic.
