```python
    # Import necessary libraries
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
    from sklearn import metrics

    # Load the dataset
    df = pd.read_csv('car_data.csv')

    # Preprocess the data
    df = df.dropna()

    # Select features and target
    X = df[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']]
    y = df['price']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

    # Create a linear regression model
    model = LinearRegression()

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model
    print('Mean Absolute Error:', metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions))
    print('Mean Squared Error:', metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions))
    print('Root Mean Squared Error:', np.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)))

    # Save the model
    import joblib
    joblib.dump(model, 'car_price_model.pkl')
    ```
    This is a simple example of a guided project. The project involves predicting car prices based on a set of features. The data is loaded from a CSV file, preprocessed, and then split into a training set and a test set. A linear regression model is created and trained on the training set. The model's predictions are evaluated and printed. Finally, the model is saved to a file for future use.
