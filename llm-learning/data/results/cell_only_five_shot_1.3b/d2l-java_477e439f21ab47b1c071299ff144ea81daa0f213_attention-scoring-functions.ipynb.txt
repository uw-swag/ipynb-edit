    The code you provided is a part of a machine learning project using the DL4J library. The project includes two classes, `AdditiveAttention` and `DotProductAttention`, which are used to implement additive and scaled dot product attention mechanisms respectively.

    The `maskedSoftmax` function is used to perform softmax operation on the last axis of the input NDArray. If `validLens` is not null, it masks the elements in the input array with a very large negative value, which is then exponentiated to get the softmax scores.

    The `AdditiveAttention` class implements additive attention mechanism. It takes the queries, keys, and values as input, calculates the attention weights using the dot product of the queries and keys, and then applies the softmax operation to these attention weights to get the final output.

    The `DotProductAttention` class implements scaled dot product attention mechanism. It calculates the attention scores using the dot product of the queries and keys, applies the softmax operation to these attention scores to get the final output.

    The project also includes a few example usage of these classes.

    Please note that the code is written in Java and uses the DL4J library, which is a machine learning library for Java.
