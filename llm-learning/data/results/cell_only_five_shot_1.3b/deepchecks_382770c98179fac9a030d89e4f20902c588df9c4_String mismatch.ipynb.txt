```python
    # String mismatch comparison
    str1 = "Hello"
    str2 = "Hello"
    if str1 == str2:
        print("Strings are equal")
    else:
        print("Strings are not equal")
    ```

    ### Explanation:
    In Python, the `==` operator is used for comparison. It checks if the values of two variables are equal or not. If they are equal, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

    In the provided code, `str1` and `str2` are two strings. The `if` statement checks if `str1` and `str2` are equal. If they are equal, it prints "Strings are equal", otherwise it prints "Strings are not equal".

    The `==` operator in Python is used for comparison, not for string mismatch. For string mismatch, you should use the `in` operator or the `not in` operator.

    Here is the corrected code:

    ```python
    str1 = "Hello"
    str2 = "Hello"
    if str1 in str2:
        print("Strings are in the same sequence")
    else:
        print("Strings are not in the same sequence")
    ```

    Or,

    ```python
    str1 = "Hello"
    str2 = "Hello"
    if str1 not in str2:
        print("Strings are in the same sequence")
    else:
        print("Strings are not in the same sequence")
    ```

    Both of these codes will check if `str1` is in the same sequence as `str2`, and print the appropriate message.
