    ## OVERVIEW
    
    This project involves the use of Python and its libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn to analyze and visualize data related to sports statistics. The data is scraped from various websites, processed, and then analyzed to provide insights and predictions.

    ## DETAILS
    
    The project is divided into several sections:

    - Data Collection: The data is collected from various sources such as sports websites, databases, and APIs.

    - Data Processing: The collected data is processed to clean it, handle missing values, and normalize it.

    - Feature Engineering: The processed data is further processed to create new features that can be used for further analysis.

    - Modeling: The data is used to train a machine learning model to predict future sports outcomes.

    - Visualization: The results are visualized using matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

    - Predictions: The model is used to predict future sports outcomes based on the current data.
