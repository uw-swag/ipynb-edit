    Your code is almost correct, but there is a small mistake in the last line of the code. The line `sub_df.head()` should be `sub_df.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)`. This will save the DataFrame to a CSV file.

    Here is the corrected code:

    ```python
    # ...
    # Save the submission file
    sub_df.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)
    # ...
    ```

    This will create a CSV file named 'submission.csv' in your current directory. You can then upload this file to the Kaggle competition page to submit your results.
