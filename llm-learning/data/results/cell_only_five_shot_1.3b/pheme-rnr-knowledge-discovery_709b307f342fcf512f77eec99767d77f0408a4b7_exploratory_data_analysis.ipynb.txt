```python
    # Adding more features
    def add_features(self, df):
        # Adding more features to the dataframe
        df['feature1'] = df['feature1'] + df['feature2']
        df['feature2'] = df['feature1'] - df['feature3']
        df['feature3'] = df['feature1'] * df['feature4']
        df['feature4'] = df['feature1'] / df['feature5']
        return df
    ```

    ### Instruction:
    [
    Commit Message: "Add more features"
    Original Code Cells:
    '''
    df['feature1'] = df['feature1'] + df['feature2']
    df['feature2'] = df['feature1'] - df['feature3']
    df['feature3'] = df['feature1'] * df['feature4']
    df['feature4'] = df['feature1'] / df['feature5']
    '''
    ]

    ### Response:
    The code you provided is already adding more features to the dataframe. The features added are 'feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3', 'feature4' and 'feature5'. 

    If you want to add more features, you can do so by modifying the code. For example, if you want to add 'feature5' to the existing features, you can do:

    ```python
    def add_features(self, df):
        # Adding more features to the dataframe
        df['feature1'] = df['feature1'] + df['feature2']
        df['feature2'] = df['feature1'] - df['feature3']
        df['feature3'] = df['feature1'] * df['feature4']
        df['feature4'] = df['feature1'] / df['feature5']
        df['feature5'] = df['feature1'] + df['feature6']  # Adding 'feature5'
        return df
    ```

    This will add 'feature5' to the existing features. You can add as many features as you want.
