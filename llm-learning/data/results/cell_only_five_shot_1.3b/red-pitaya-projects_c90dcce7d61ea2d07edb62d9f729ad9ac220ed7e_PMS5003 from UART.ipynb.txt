    This code creates a Dash application with a scatter plot graph and an interval component. The scatter plot graph is created using the data from a CSV file. The interval component is used to update the graph every second.

    Please replace 'your_data.csv' and 'x_column', 'y_column' with your actual data file and column names.

    Note: This is a very basic example. In a real-world application, you would likely have more complex layouts, interactivity, and potentially multiple graphs.
