```python
    # Description: This is a Python code snippet that uses the Scikit-Learn library to implement a simple perceptron model.
    # The perceptron model is a binary classifier that learns to predict the class of a given input based on the weights assigned to the input features.
    # The code first defines a constant `tau`, which is used to calculate the weights `w_p` and `w_n` for the perceptron model.
    # Then, it creates a dictionary `class_weight` where the keys are the class labels and the values are the corresponding weights.
    # The code then trains a Logistic Regression model on the input data `x` and the target labels `s`.
    # The model's predictions are stored in `y_hat`.
    # Finally, the code prints the predictions and the actual labels.
    ```
