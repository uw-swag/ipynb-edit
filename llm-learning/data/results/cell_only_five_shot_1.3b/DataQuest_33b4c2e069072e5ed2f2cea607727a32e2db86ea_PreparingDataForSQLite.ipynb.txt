    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook. It's a series of operations on a dataset, which is a part of a course in "Working With Data Sources". The course is taught in Python and uses libraries like pandas, sqlite3, and matplotlib.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    1. The first part of the code imports necessary libraries and loads a dataset.
    2. It then prints the number of rows and columns in the dataset.
    3. It prints the first three rows of the dataset.
    4. It checks for unnamed columns that might contain useful information.
    5. It filters the dataset to only include rows where the 'Year' is greater than 2000.
    6. It selects only the columns 'Actor -- Leading Role', 'Actor -- Supporting Role', 'Actress -- Leading Role', and 'Actress -- Supporting Role' and creates a new dataframe.
    7. It adds a new column 'Won' to the dataframe, where 'YES' is mapped to 1 and 'NO' is mapped to 0.
    8. It removes unnecessary columns from the dataframe.
    9. It splits the 'Additional Info' column into two new columns 'Movie' and 'Character'.
    10. It drops the 'Additional Info' column from the dataframe.
    11. It connects to a SQLite database and stores the final dataframe into a table named 'nominations'.
    12. It queries the 'nominations' table and prints the first 10 rows.

    The final part of the code is a series of SQL queries that are used to fetch and display the first 10 rows from the 'nominations' table in the SQLite database.

    Please note that the code is written in a Jupyter notebook format, which is a web-based interactive data analysis environment. It allows for the execution of Python code, data manipulation, and visualization in a single, readable format.
