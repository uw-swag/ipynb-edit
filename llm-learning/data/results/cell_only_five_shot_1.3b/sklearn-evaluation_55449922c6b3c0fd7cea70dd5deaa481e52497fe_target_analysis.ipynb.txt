    # This is a placeholder for the migration process.
    # The actual process will depend on the specifics of your documentation.

    # Please replace this placeholder with your actual migration process.

    # For example, if you're migrating from a markdown file, you might use the following command:

    # jupyter-book serve .

    # This command will start a local server that will serve your documentation.

    # If you're migrating from a different format, you'll need to use a different command.

    # For example, if you're migrating from a PDF, you might use the following command:

    # jupyter-book build .

    # This command will generate a static HTML site from your markdown files.

    # Please note that the actual process will depend on the specifics of your documentation.
