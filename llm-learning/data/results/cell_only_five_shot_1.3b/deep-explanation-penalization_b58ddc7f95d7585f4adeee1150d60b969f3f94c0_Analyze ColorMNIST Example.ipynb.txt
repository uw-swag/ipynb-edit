    The code you've provided is used to load the results of a machine learning model trained on the ISIC dataset. The results are then saved in a pandas DataFrame, which is then converted to LaTeX for easier readability.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    1. The code first imports the necessary libraries.
    2. It then loads the trained models from the specified folder.
    3. The model names are sorted to ensure that the block models are not included.
    4. The results of each model are loaded into a list, and then concatenated into a single DataFrame.
    5. The 'final_acc' and 'final_acc_train' columns are created by taking the maximum of the 'accs_test' and 'accs_train' columns, respectively.
    6. The 'final_test_loss' and 'final_train_loss' columns are created by taking the minimum of the 'losses_test' and 'losses_train' columns, respectively.
    7. The 'acc_color' column is created by setting all values to 0.
    8. The NaN values are dropped from the DataFrame.
    9. The DataFrame is reset to its original index.
    10. The DataFrame is sorted by the 'regularizer_rate' column.
    11. The DataFrame is filtered to only include models with a train accuracy greater than 15.
    12. The DataFrame is grouped by the 'regularizer_rate' column and the mean of the columns 'Test accuracy', 'Train accuracy', 'Test loss', 'Color accuracy', and 'CD' is calculated.
    13. The DataFrame is saved to a LaTeX file.

    The LaTeX file 'colormnist.tex' is used to display the results in a LaTeX document.

    Please note that the code assumes that the 'accs_test' and 'accs_train' columns contain lists of accuracy values, and the 'losses_test' and 'losses_train' columns contain lists of loss values.
