```python
    import pandas as pd
    from outlier_detection import StringLengthOutOfBounds

    col = ["a","a","a","a","a","a","a","a","a","a","a","a","a","ab","ab","ab","ab","ab","ab", "ab"]*1000
    col.append("basdbadsbaaaaaaaaaa")
    col.append("basdbadsbaaaaaaaaaaa")
    df = pd.DataFrame({"col1":col})

    # Calculate the minimum outlier difference
    outlier_diff = StringLengthOutOfBounds().run(df)
    print(f"The minimum outlier difference is {outlier_diff}")
    ```

    This code will calculate the minimum outlier difference between the length of the string and the number of occurrences of the string. The `StringLengthOutOfBounds` function is a custom function that calculates the difference between the length of the string and the number of occurrences of the string. The `run` method is used to apply the function to the DataFrame.

    Please note that the `StringLengthOutOfBounds` function is not defined in the provided code, so it's assumed that it's a custom function. If it's not, you'll need to define it.
