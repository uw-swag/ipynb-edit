```python
    from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

    # Create KNN classifier
    knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)

    # Fit the classifier to the data
    knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Predict the response for test dataset
    y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)

    # Model Accuracy
    print("Accuracy:",metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
    ```
    This code creates a KNN classifier with 3 neighbors and fits the model to the training data. It then makes predictions on the test data and calculates the accuracy of these predictions.
