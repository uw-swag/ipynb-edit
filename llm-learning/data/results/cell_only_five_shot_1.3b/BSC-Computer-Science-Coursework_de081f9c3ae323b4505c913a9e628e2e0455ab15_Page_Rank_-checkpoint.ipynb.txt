    ### Problem Statement

    ### Linear Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with vectors, matrices, and their operations. In this practical, you will be given a set of vectors and asked to perform various operations on them.

    ### Objectives

    ### The objectives of this practical are:

    ### 1. Understanding of vector operations.
    ### 2. Understanding of matrix operations.
    ### 3. Practice of vector and matrix operations.

    ### Problem

    ### You are given a set of vectors. Your task is to perform the following operations on these vectors:

    ### 1. Add two vectors.
    ### 2. Subtract two vectors.
    ### 3. Multiply a vector by a scalar.
    ### 4. Dot product of two vectors.
    ### 5. Cross product of two vectors.
    ### 6. Normalize a vector.

    ### Input

    ### The first line of the input file contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) which is the number of vectors.

    ### Each of the following n lines contains a vector in the format:
    ### The first line contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100) which is the number of components in the vector.
    ### The next m lines contain the components of the vector.

    ### Output

    ### The output should be the result of each operation.

    ### Example

    ### Input:

    ### 3
    ### 2
    ### 1.0
    ### 2.0
    ### 3.0
    ### 4.0
    ### 5.0

    ### Output:

    ### 6.0
    ### 7.0
    ### 8.0

    ### Explanation

    ### Add two vectors:
    ### [1,2,3] + [4,5,6] = [5
