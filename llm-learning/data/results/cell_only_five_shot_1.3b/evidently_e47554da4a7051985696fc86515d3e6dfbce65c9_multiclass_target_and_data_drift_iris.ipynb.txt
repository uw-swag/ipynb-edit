    ## Iris Data Set
    ### Iris Data Set
    # The Iris dataset is a classic multi-class classification dataset. It contains measurements of 150 iris flowers from three different species. The dataset is used to illustrate the usage of the `evidently` library.

    ### How to Use
    #### Data Drift
    # The `DataDriftTab` tab in the `Dashboard` class can be used to visualize the differences between the distributions of two datasets.

    ```python
    from evidently.dashboard import Dashboard
    from evidently.dashboard.tabs import DataDriftTab

    # Create a Dashboard object
    dashboard = Dashboard(tabs=[DataDriftTab(verbose_level=1)])

    # Calculate the drift between two datasets
    dashboard.calculate(iris_frame[:75], iris_frame[75:], column_mapping=None)

    # Show the dashboard
    dashboard.show()
    ```

    #### Cat Target Drift
    # The `CatTargetDriftTab` tab in the `Dashboard` class can be used to visualize the differences between the distributions of two datasets, considering the target variable.

    ```python
    from evidently.dashboard import Dashboard
    from evidently.dashboard.tabs import CatTargetDriftTab

    # Create a Dashboard object
    dashboard = Dashboard(tabs=[CatTargetDriftTab(verbose_level=1)])

    # Calculate the drift between two datasets
    dashboard.calculate(iris_frame[:75], iris_frame[75:], column_mapping=None)

    # Show the dashboard
    dashboard.show()
    ```

    #### Model Profile
    # The `Profile` class in the `evidently` library can be used to generate a detailed report of the model's performance.

    ```python
    from evidently.profile import Profile
    from evidently.profile.sections import DataDriftProfileSection, CatTargetDriftProfileSection

    # Create a Profile object
    profile
