```python
    def remove_blanks(line):
        """
        This function removes the blanks from a line of text.
        """
        return line.replace(" ", "")

    # Testing the function
    line = "This is a test line with blanks"
    print(f"Original line: {line}")
    print(f"Line without blanks: {remove_blanks(line)}")
    ```

    This code defines a function `remove_blanks` that takes a line of text as input and returns the same line with all the blanks removed. The function is then tested with a sample line of text.
