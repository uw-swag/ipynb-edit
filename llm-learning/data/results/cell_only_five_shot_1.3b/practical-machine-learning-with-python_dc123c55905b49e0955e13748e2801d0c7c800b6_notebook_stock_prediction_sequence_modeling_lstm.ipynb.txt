    The code you provided is a Python script for a stock price prediction using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model. It uses the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model, which is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The script also uses Keras, a high-level neural networks API, to build and train the model.

    The script first imports necessary libraries and modules. It then loads the stock price data, and plots the original data and the predicted values.

    The script splits the data into a training set and a test set. It then builds the RNN model and trains it. After training, it forecasts the values and evaluates the performance of the model. Finally, it plots the true values, the predicted values, and the forecasted values.

    The script uses the LSTM model, which is a type of RNN. The LSTM model is used because it can capture temporal dependencies in the data, which is important for stock price prediction.

    The script uses the mean squared error (MSE) as the performance metric, which is a common metric for regression problems. The MSE is the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.

    The script uses the inverse transformation to convert the predicted values back to the original scale.

    The script uses the seaborn library for plotting, which is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib.

    The script uses the pad_sequences function to pad the input sequences to the maximum length of the sequences.

    The script uses the math and numpy libraries for mathematical operations and array manipulation, respectively.

    The script uses the sklearn.metrics library for the mean_squared_error function, which is a function to calculate the mean squared error of a regression model.

    The script uses the matplotlib library for plotting, which is a plotting library for the Python programming language.
