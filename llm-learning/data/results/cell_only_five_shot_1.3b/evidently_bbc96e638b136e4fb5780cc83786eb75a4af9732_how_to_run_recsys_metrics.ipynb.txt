    The code you've provided is used to generate a report of metrics for a recommendation system. The metrics used in this report are Precision@k, Recall@k, F-Beta@k, Mean Average Precision@k, Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain@k, Diversity@k, Novelty@k, Personalization@k, Serendipity@k, and Popularity Bias@k.

    The `Report` class is used to group multiple metrics together. The `run` method is used to generate the report.

    The `ColumnMapping` class is used to map the columns in the dataframes.

    The `PrecisionTopKMetric`, `RecallTopKMetric`, `FBetaTopKMetric`, `MAPKMetric`, `NDCGKMetric`, `DiversityMetric`, `NoveltyMetric`, `PersonalisationMetric`, `SerendipityMetric`, `PopularityBias`, `ItemBiasMetric`, `UserBiasMetric` are custom metrics that you've defined.

    The `run` method takes three arguments: `reference_data`, `current_data`, and `column_mapping`. `reference_data` is the data that the model was trained on, `current_data` is the data that the model is currently evaluating, and `column_mapping` is a dictionary that maps the column names in the dataframes to the column names in the report.

    The `run` method returns a report object, which you can print or use for further analysis.

    The code you've provided is a good example of how to use these classes to generate a report of metrics for a recommendation system.
