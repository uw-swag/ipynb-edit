    ### 2.1: What is Machine Learning?

    Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building intelligent machines that can learn from experience. It is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.

    ### 2.2: Types of Machine Learning

    There are several types of machine learning, including:

    - Supervised Learning: The model is trained on a labeled dataset. The goal is to learn a function that maps inputs to outputs.

    - Unsupervised Learning: The model is trained on an unlabeled dataset. The goal is to find patterns in the data.

    - Reinforcement Learning: The model learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment, receiving rewards or penalties, and potentially making new actions.

    - Semi-supervised Learning: The model is trained on a mixture of labeled and unlabeled data.

    - Transfer Learning: The model is trained on a large dataset and then used to make predictions on a smaller dataset.

    ### 2.3: Advantages of Machine Learning

    Advantages of Machine Learning include:

    - Automation: Machine learning algorithms can be automated to perform complex tasks.

    - Scalability: Machine learning can handle large amounts of data and complex computations.

    - Robustness: Machine learning models can handle a wide range of inputs and provide accurate predictions.

    - Interpretability: Machine learning models can be understood by humans, which can be very useful for debugging and understanding the results.

    ### 2.4: Disadvantages of Machine Learning

    Disadvantages of Machine Learning include:

    - Overfitting: Machine learning models can overfit the training data, leading to poor performance on unseen data.

    - Underfitting: Machine learning models can underfit the training data, leading to poor performance.

    - Data Privacy: Machine learning models can be sensitive to the details of the input data, leading to privacy concerns.

    - Dependence on Human Intelligence: Machine learning models are based on algorithms and require human intelligence to interpret and use.
