    The original code is not provided, but the provided code is a Jupyter notebook that uses Google Cloud AutoML Operations to deploy a machine learning model and monitor it. The model is deployed on a Google Cloud AI Platform endpoint, and the monitoring job is created to check the model's performance.

    The notebook also includes a pipeline that automates the deployment and monitoring process. The pipeline includes tasks for deploying the model, creating a monitoring job, and testing the monitoring job. The parameters for the pipeline are defined in a dictionary, which is passed to the `AutoMLOps.generate` function.

    The pipeline is then provisioned and deployed using the `AutoMLOps.provision` and `AutoMLOps.deploy` functions, respectively. The `hide_warnings` parameter is set to `False` to suppress warning messages.
