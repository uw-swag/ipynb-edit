The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook. It uses the Deepchecks library to analyze a dataset, and then applies various machine learning models to it. The models are AdaBoost, Random Forest, and Decision Tree. The performance of these models is then evaluated using the Deepchecks library.

The code is divided into two parts:

1. The first part loads the iris dataset and splits it into a training set and a test set. It then creates a Dataset object for the training set and a test set.

2. The second part applies the AdaBoost, Random Forest, and Decision Tree models to the training set and evaluates their performance on the test set.

The code is also applied to the diabetes dataset, which is a regression dataset. The models are AdaBoost Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Decision Tree Regressor.

The `MultiModelPerformanceReport` function is used to compare the performance of the models on the test set.

The `run` method of the `MultiModelPerformanceReport` class is used to generate a report that includes the performance of each model.

The final part of the code is a comment that explains the purpose of the code.

The code is not deleting any notebooks, it's just deleting the notebooks that are being used for the analysis.
