    The code you provided is a complete TensorFlow program that trains a deep neural network (DNN) on the MNIST dataset. The DNN has 3 hidden layers, and the number of neurons in each layer is a random value from a distribution defined by the `param_distribs` dictionary. The DNN uses the leaky ReLU activation function, and the optimizer is a variant of the Momentum optimizer.

    The program also includes a random search for hyperparameter tuning, which is a technique used to find the best hyperparameters for a machine learning model. The random search is performed on the DNN model, using the MNIST training data.

    The program then trains the DNN on the MNIST training data, validates it on the MNIST validation data, and tests it on the MNIST test data. The results are printed to the console.

    The code is well-structured and follows good practices for TensorFlow programming.
