```python
    from keras.callbacks import TensorBoard

    # TensorBoard callback
    tensorboard = TensorBoard(log_dir='./logs', histogram_freq=1)

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, Y_train, epochs=10, callbacks=[tensorboard])
    ```

    This code will start a TensorBoard server, which will log the performance of the model during training. The logs will be saved in the directory specified by the `log_dir` parameter. The `histogram_freq` parameter determines how often to log histograms of model weights.
