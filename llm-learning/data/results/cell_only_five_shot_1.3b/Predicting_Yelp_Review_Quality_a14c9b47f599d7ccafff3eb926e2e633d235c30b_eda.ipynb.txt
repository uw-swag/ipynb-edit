```python
    # Import necessary libraries
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns

    # Load the dataset
    df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

    # Check the first few rows of the dataset
    print(df.head())

    # Check the summary statistics of the dataset
    print(df.describe())

    # Check the distribution of the target variable
    sns.countplot(df['target_variable'])
    plt.show()

    # Check the correlation between different features
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))
    sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
    plt.show()

    # Check the distribution of the categorical variables
    for column in df.select_dtypes(include=['object']):
        df[column].value_counts().plot(kind='bar')
        plt.title(f'Distribution of {column}')
        plt.show()
    ```
    This script will perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on your dataset. It will provide a summary of the dataset, a count plot of the target variable, a heatmap of the correlation between different features, and a bar plot for each categorical variable.

    Please replace 'your_dataset.csv' with the path to your actual dataset, and 'target_variable' with the name of your target variable.

    This is a basic EDA script. Depending on the nature of your dataset, you may need to perform more complex analysis or feature engineering.
