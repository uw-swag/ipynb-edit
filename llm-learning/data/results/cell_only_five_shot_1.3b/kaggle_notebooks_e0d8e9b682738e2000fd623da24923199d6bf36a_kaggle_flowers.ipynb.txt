The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the Keras library to train a number of different models on a dataset of flower images. The models include a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), an Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and an InceptionV3 model.

The code is divided into several sections:

1. Importing necessary libraries and modules.
2. Loading the dataset and preprocessing it.
3. Training the MLP model.
4. Training the CNN model.
5. Training the RNN model.
6. Training the InceptionV3 model.
7. Evaluating the models and comparing their performance.

The code is written in Python and uses the Keras library, which is a high-level neural networks API, to build and train models. The code also uses TensorFlow as the backend, which is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence.
