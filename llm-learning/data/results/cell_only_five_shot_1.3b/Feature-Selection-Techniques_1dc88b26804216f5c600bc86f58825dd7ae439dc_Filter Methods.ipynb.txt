    The code you provided is a Python script that uses various machine learning and data science techniques to filter and preprocess data. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. `constant_feature_detect`: This function is used to detect features that are predominantly constant in the dataset. It does this by calculating the frequency of each feature in the dataset and then selecting those features that have a frequency above a given threshold.

2. `corr_feature_detect`: This function is used to detect features that have a correlation coefficient above a given threshold with the target variable.

3. `mutual_info`: This function is used to select features based on the mutual information score. It can select the top `select_k` features with the highest mutual information score.

4. `chi_square_test`: This function is used to select features based on the chi-square test. It can select the top `select_k` features with the highest chi-square test statistic.

5. The last part of the code is a series of function calls to apply these feature selection techniques to the training and testing datasets.

Please note that the `constant_feature_detect`, `corr_feature_detect`, `mutual_info`, and `chi_square_test` functions are not defined in the provided code. They are likely to be defined elsewhere in your code.
