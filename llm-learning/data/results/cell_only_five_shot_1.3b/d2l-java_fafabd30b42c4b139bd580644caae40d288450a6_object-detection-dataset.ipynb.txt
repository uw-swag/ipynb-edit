    # Object Detection Section 13.6 (#26)
    # Object detection is a crucial part of image processing and computer vision.
    # In this section, we will discuss the concept of object detection, the algorithms used for object detection, and the steps involved in object detection.

    # 1. Concept of Object Detection
    # Object detection is the process of identifying and locating objects in an image. It involves identifying the presence of an object in an image, and locating it within the image.

    # 2. Algorithms Used for Object Detection
    # There are several algorithms used for object detection, including but not limited to:
    # - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
    # - Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
    # - Random Forests
    # - Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with RBF kernel
    # - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a pre-trained model

    # 3. Steps Involved in Object Detection
    # The process of object detection typically involves the following steps:
    # - Preprocessing: Cleaning the image, converting it to grayscale, or other preprocessing steps.
    # - Feature Extraction: Extracting features from the image, such as edges, corners, or textures.
    # - Classification: Classifying the features into different categories or classes.
    # - Non-maximum Suppression (NMS): Removing overlapping bounding boxes.
    # - Postprocessing: Decoding the bounding box predictions to the original image coordinates.

    # 4. Example of Object Detection in Python
    # Here is a simple example of object detection using OpenCV and Python.

    import cv2
    import numpy as np

    # Load the image
    image = cv2.imread('image.jpg')

    # Convert the image to grayscale
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

    # Load the cascade
    face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface
