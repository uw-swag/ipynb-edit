    ### Response:
    The code you provided is a basic example of how to use scikit-learn's Linear Regression model to predict a target variable based on a set of features. The code first loads a dataset, then it splits the data into a training set and a test set. The model is then trained on the training set, and the model's predictions are made on the test set. Finally, the model's performance is evaluated using the mean absolute error, mean squared error, and root mean squared error metrics.

    However, the code you provided is missing the part where you would upload the data file. If you want to upload a file, you would need to use a library like `p
