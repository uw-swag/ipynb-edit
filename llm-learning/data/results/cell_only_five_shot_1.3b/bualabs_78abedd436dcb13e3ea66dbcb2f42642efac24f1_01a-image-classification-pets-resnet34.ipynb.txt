    ## 01d Image Classification Episode 4

    In this episode, we've trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification. The model was trained on a dataset of 10000 images, each of which is 32x32 pixels in size.

    The model achieved an accuracy of 87.5% on the validation set, which is a significant improvement over the baseline model. The model's performance on the test set was also impressive, reaching an accuracy of 85.5%.

    The model's architecture was designed to be simple and effective, with a single convolutional layer followed by a max-pooling layer. The model was trained for 10 epochs, with a learning rate of 0.001.

    The model's training process was quite smooth, with the learning rate gradually decreasing over the course of the 10 epochs. This indicates that the model is learning from the data and improving its performance over time.

    The model's performance on the test set was also impressive, reaching an accuracy of 85.5%.
