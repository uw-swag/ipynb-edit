    Commit Message: "Added code to generate a table with the top 10 most common words in a text"
    Original Code:
    '''
    from collections import Counter
    text = "Insert your text here"
    '''
    ]

    ### Response:
    Here is a Python code snippet that generates a table with the top 10 most common words in a text:

    ```python
    from collections import Counter

    # Your text here
    text = "Insert your text here"

    # Split the text into words
    words = text.split()

    # Count the frequency of each word
    word_counts = Counter(words)

    # Get the top 10 most common words
    top_10_words = word_counts.most_common(10)

    # Create a table with the top 10 words
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.DataFrame(top_10_words, columns=["Word", "Frequency"])
    print(df)
    ```

    This code will output a table with the top 10 most common words in the text, along with their frequency.
