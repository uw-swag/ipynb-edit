    ## Now, your files are ready to be used in your notebook.

    ## For example, if you uploaded a CSV file named "data.csv", you can use it in your notebook like this:

    ```python
    df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
    ```

    ## Remember to replace 'data.csv' with the name of your file.

    ## If you want to use a file from a different location, you can use the `os` module to get the absolute path of the file:

    ```python
    import os
    file_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'data', 'data.csv')
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    ```

    ## This will read the file from the 'data' directory in the current working directory.

    ## If you have multiple files, you can use a loop to read them all:

    ```python
    for file in os.listdir(os.getcwd()):
        if file.endswith('.csv'):
            df = pd.read_csv(file)
            # do something with df
    ```

    ## This will read all CSV files in the current working directory and its subdirectories.

    ## Remember to replace 'data' with the name of your directory.

    ## If you want to use a file from a different location, you can use the `os` module to get the absolute path of the file:

    ```python
    import os
    file_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'data', 'data.csv')
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    ```
