    # The code is trying to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of tweets related to the "Germanwings Crash" event.
    # The EDA includes:
    # 1. Fetching the tweets from a specific source.
    # 2. Aggregating the tweets by event.
    # 3. Plotting the distribution of source and response tweets by event.
    # 4. Plotting the distribution of rumor and non-rumor tweets by event.
    # 5. Plotting the distribution of thread lengths by event.
    # 6. Plotting the connections between users in the threads.

    # The code is incomplete because it lacks the part where it fetches the connections between users in the threads.

    # The code is also incomplete because it lacks the part where it plots the connections between users in the threads.
