The `expon()` function in scipy.stats is used to generate a random sample from a exponential distribution. The exponential distribution is defined as:

    f(x; scale) = scale * exp(-scale*x)

where 'scale' is the rate parameter. The default scale is 1.0, but it can be set to any positive number.

The `reciprocal()` function in scipy.stats is used to generate a random sample from a reciprocal distribution. The reciprocal distribution is defined as:

    f(x) = 1/x

This distribution is undefined for x = 0.

In the given code, the `expon()` function is used to generate a random sample from an exponential distribution, which is then used as the scale parameter in the `reciprocal()` function. The `reciprocal()` function is used to generate a random sample from a reciprocal distribution, which is then used to scale the exponential distribution.

The resulting samples are then plotted to visualize the distribution of the generated data.
