```python
    # import necessary libraries
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

    # define a function to normalize business value
    def normalize_business_value(df, column):
        scaler = MinMaxScaler()
        df[column] = scaler.fit_transform(df[[column]])
        return df

    # test the function
    df = pd.DataFrame({
        'business_value': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
    })

    df_normalized = normalize_business_value(df, 'business_value')

    print(df_normalized)
    ```
    This code will normalize the 'business_value' column in the DataFrame. The MinMaxScaler is used to scale the data to a range between 0 and 1.

    Please note that the function `normalize_business_value` assumes that the 'business_value' column is numeric. If the column contains non-numeric values, you may need to handle them accordingly.

    Also, the function `normalize_business_value` does not return the DataFrame, it only prints the normalized DataFrame. If you want to use the normalized DataFrame for further processing, you can modify the function accordingly.
