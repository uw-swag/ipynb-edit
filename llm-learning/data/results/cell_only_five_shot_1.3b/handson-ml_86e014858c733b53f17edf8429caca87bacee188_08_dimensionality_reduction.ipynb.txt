    The code you provided seems to be a part of a Jupyter notebook, and it's using matplotlib to create 3D plots. The code is divided into several cells, each of which is responsible for a different task.

    Here's a brief explanation of what each cell does:

    1. The first cell is importing necessary libraries and modules. It's using the numpy, matplotlib, and mpl_toolkits libraries.

    2. The second cell is importing the dataset. It's using the readFile function to read the dataset from a file.

    3. The third cell is creating a 3D plot. It's using the Axes3D library to create a 3D plot. It's also using the numpy and matplotlib libraries.

    4. The fourth cell is creating a 3D scatter plot. It's using the Axes3D library to create a 3D scatter plot. It's also using the numpy and matplotlib libraries.

    5. The fifth cell is creating a 3D surface plot. It's using the Axes3D library to create a 3D surface plot. It's also using the numpy and matplotlib libraries.

    6. The sixth cell is creating a 3D plot with a workaround for a matplotlib issue. It's using the Axes3D library to create a 3D plot. It's also using the numpy and matplotlib libraries.

    7. The last cell is creating a 2D scatter plot. It's using the matplotlib library to create a 2D scatter plot. It's also using the numpy and matplotlib libraries.

    Each of these cells is responsible for a different task, and the code is organized in a way that makes it easy to follow along with the notebook.
