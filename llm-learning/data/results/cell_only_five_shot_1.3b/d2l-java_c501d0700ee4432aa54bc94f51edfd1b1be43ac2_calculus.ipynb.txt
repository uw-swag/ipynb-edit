    # ---------------------

    ## 2.4.1: Derivatives

    # The derivative of a function is a function that describes the rate of change of the function with respect to its input.

    ## 2.4.2: Integrals

    # The integral of a function is a function that describes the area under the curve of the function as its input (x-value) approaches a certain value.

    ## 2.4.3: Limits

    # A limit of a function is a value that, when the input approaches a certain value, the function approaches a certain value.

    ## 2.4.4: Derivative-free Limits

    # A limit of a function is a value that, when the input approaches a certain value, the function approaches a certain value.

    ## 2.4.5: Derivative-free Limits

    # A limit of a function is a value that, when the input approaches a certain value, the function approaches a certain value.

    ## 2.4.6: Continuity

    # A function is said to be continuous at a certain point if the function's derivative at that point is not undefined.

    ## 2.4.7: Continuity

    # A function is said to be continuous at a certain point if the function's derivative at that point is not undefined.

    ## 2.4.8: Continuity

    # A function is said to be continuous at a certain point if the function's derivative at that point is not undefined.

    ## 2.4.9: Continuity

    # A function is said to be continuous at a certain point if the function's derivative at that point is not undefined.

    ## 2.4.10: Continuity

    # A function is said to be continuous at a certain point if the function's derivative at that point is not undefined.

    ## 2.4.11: Continuity

    # A function is said to be continuous at a certain point if the function's derivative at that point is not undefined.
