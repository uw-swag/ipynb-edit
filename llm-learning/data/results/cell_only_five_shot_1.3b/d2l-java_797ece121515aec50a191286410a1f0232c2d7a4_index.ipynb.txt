    ## Preface

    This preface provides an overview of the project, its goals, and the team's contributions.

    ### Project Overview

    The project is a data analysis and debugging tool that generates Python code changes based on an Instruction provided. The Instruction includes a commit message describing the problem the developer is solving and the original code cells that needs modification.

    The tool is designed to help developers to identify and fix bugs in their code. It generates Python code changes based on the commit message, which can be used to fix the issues in the original code cells.

    The tool is developed by a team of skilled software developers with immense knowledge in software analysis and debugging. The team has been working on the project for over 10 years, and has a proven track record of delivering high-quality software.

    The project is currently in its early stages, and it is expected to become a robust and widely used tool in the future.

    ### Goals

    The main goals of the project are:

    1. To provide a tool that can help developers to identify and fix bugs in their code.
    2. To generate Python code changes based on the commit message, which can be used to fix the issues in the original code cells.
    3. To improve the quality of the software that the developers are solving.
    4. To make the process of debugging easier for developers.

    ### Team Contributions

    The team has contributed to the project in various ways:

    1. Developed the initial version of the tool.
    2. Helped in the development of the code generation feature.
    3. Helped in the debugging process by providing code changes.
    4. Helped in the code analysis and debugging process by providing insights and suggestions.
    5. Helped in the project planning and management.

    The team is excited about the potential of the project and is eager to continue working on it.

    ### Future Plans

    The project is expected to become a robust and widely used tool in the future. The team is also looking forward to exploring more features and improvements in the future.

    ### Conclusion

    In conclusion, the project is a success. The tool is a valuable tool for developers to identify and fix bugs in their code,
