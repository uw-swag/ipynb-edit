    The code you provided is written in Java and uses the Deep Java Library (DJL) for machine learning. The version of DJL you're using is 0.8.0.

    The code is importing a number of libraries and classes from the DJL library. It's also defining a few custom classes, including an `ImagePanel` and a `Container`.

    The `ImagePanel` class is a custom JPanel that scales an image and draws it on the panel. The `Container` class is a custom JPanel that displays two labels side by side.

    The `showImages` function is a utility function that takes a dataset of images, the number of images to display, the width and height of the display, the scale factor, and a NDManager, and displays a list of images.

    The code also uses the Maven build system to manage dependencies. The `%maven` directives are used to specify the Maven coordinates of the dependencies.

    The version of the DJL library you're using is 0.8.0.

    The version of the Maven repository you're using is the one specified in the `%mavenRepo` directive.
