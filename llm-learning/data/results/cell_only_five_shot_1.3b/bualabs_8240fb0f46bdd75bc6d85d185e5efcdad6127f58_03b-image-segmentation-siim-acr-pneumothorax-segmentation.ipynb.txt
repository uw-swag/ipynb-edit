    # This is a placeholder for the code you'd write to get the top 10 in Kaggle's private leaderboard.
    # You'd need to replace the placeholder with the actual code.

    # For example, if you're using the Kaggle API, you could do something like this:

    from kaggle.api.kaggle_api_extended import KaggleApi

    api = KaggleApi()
    api.authenticate()

    competition_id = 'your-competition-id'
    api.competition_scores(competition_id)

    # This will return a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the score for a particular user.
    # The 'score' key in each dictionary will contain the score.

    # You can then sort this list by the 'score' key to get the top 10.

    top_10 = sorted(scores, key=lambda x: x['score'], reverse=True)[:10]

    # Now you can print the top 10 scores.
    for user, score in top_10:
        print(f"User: {user}, Score: {score}")
    ```

    Please replace 'your-competition-id' with the actual competition ID you're using.
