    The code you provided is a set of functions for implementing various machine learning algorithms on a dataset. These functions are designed to perform classification tasks, such as training and testing a model on a dataset.

    Here's a brief explanation of the functions:

    - `SVM`: This function implements the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. It takes the training and testing datasets, and the results dataframe as input. It then trains the SVM model, makes predictions, and calculates the performance metrics for the model.

    - `KNN`: This function implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. It also takes the training and testing datasets, and the results dataframe as input. It then trains the KNN model, makes predictions, and calculates the performance metrics for the model.

    - `NaiveBayes_Kfold`: This function implements the Naive Bayes algorithm in a k-fold cross-validation. It takes the training and testing datasets, the results dataframe, and the experiment type as input. It then trains the Naive Bayes model in a k-fold cross-validation, makes predictions, and calculates the performance metrics for the model.

    - `DecisionTrees`: This function implements the Decision Trees algorithm. It also takes the training and testing datasets, and the results dataframe as input. It then trains the Decision Trees model, makes predictions, and calculates the performance metrics for the model.

    - `RandomForest`: This function implements the Random Forest algorithm. It also takes the training and testing datasets, and the results dataframe as input. It then trains the Random Forest model, makes predictions, and calculates the performance metrics for the model.

    - `LDA`: This function implements the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) algorithm. It also takes the training and testing datasets, and the results dataframe as input. It then trains the LDA model, makes predictions, and calculates the performance metrics for the model.

    - `LogReg`: This function implements the Logistic Regression algorithm. It also takes the training and testing datasets, and the results dataframe as input. It then trains the Logistic Regression model, makes predictions, and calculates the performance metrics for the model.

    Each of these functions also has a k
