    The code you provided is a mix of Python code and Jupyter notebook markdown cells. It's not a single Python code block, but a series of cells that are meant to be executed in sequence.

    Here's a breakdown of what each cell does:

    1. `%run ../common/import_all.py`: This cell is used to import all the necessary Python modules from the `../common` directory.

    2. `from sklearn.svm import SVR`: This line is used to import the SVR (Support Vector Regression) class from the sklearn.svm module.

    3. `svm_poly_reg = SVR(kernel="poly", degree=2, C=100, epsilon=0.1)`: This line creates a new SVR object with a polynomial kernel, a degree of 2, a C value of 100, and an epsilon value of 0.1.

    4. `svm_poly_reg.fit(X, y)`: This line fits the SVR object to the training data.

    5. The same lines are repeated for a second SVR object with a different degree, C value, and epsilon value.

    6. `from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D`: This line is used to import the Axes3D class from the mpl_toolkits.mplot3d module.

    7. `def plot_3D_decision_function(ax, w, b, x1_lim=[4, 6], x2_lim=[0.8, 2.8])`: This function is used to plot a 3D decision function.

    8. The same lines are repeated for a different set of parameters.

    9. `fig = plt.figure(figsize=(11, 6))`: This line creates a new figure with a specified size.

    10. `ax1 = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')`: This line creates a new subplot and sets it to a 3D projection.

    11. `plot_3D_decision_
