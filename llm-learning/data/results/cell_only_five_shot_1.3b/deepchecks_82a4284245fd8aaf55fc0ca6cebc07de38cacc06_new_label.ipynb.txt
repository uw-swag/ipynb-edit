```python
    # This is an example of how to use the ChatGPT API to generate responses.
    # You need to replace 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY' with your actual API key.

    import openai

    openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

    def generate_response(prompt):
        response = openai.Completion.create(
            engine="text-davinci-003",
            prompt=prompt,
            max_tokens=100,
            temperature=0.7,
        )
        return response["choices"][0]["text"]

    # Example usage:
    prompt = "What is the capital of France?"
    response = generate_response(prompt)
    print(response)
    ```
    This code uses the OpenAI's ChatGPT API to generate a response to a given prompt. The `generate_response` function takes a prompt as input and returns the generated response.

    Please note that you need to have an active OpenAI account to use the API. Also, the API key should be kept secure and not exposed in the code.

    Also, the `max_tokens` parameter in the `openai.Completion.create` function controls the length of the generated response. The `temperature` parameter controls the randomness of the generated response.

    The `engine` parameter in the `openai.Completion.create` function specifies the model to use for generating the response. In this case, it's set to "text-davinci-003", which is a powerful model that can generate human-like text.

    The `prompt` parameter in the `openai.Completion.create` function is the question or statement that the model will generate a response for.

    The `response["choices"][0]["text"]` line is the actual response generated by the model.

    This is a simple example and might not work for all use cases. The OpenAI API has many more parameters and options that you can use to customize the response generation process.
