    This code block imports the necessary libraries and defines the functions for Lasso Regression, RSS, and plotting.
    The Lasso function takes in the features matrix X, the target vector y, the regularization parameter alpha, and the tolerance for the Lasso regression.
    The RSS function calculates the Residual Sum of Squares, which is a measure of how well the model's predictions match the actual values.
    The plot function takes in the x-values, y-values, and a label for the plot, and plots the data.
    The code block also includes a comment to explain what each part of the code does.
    Please note that the code block is incomplete and does not contain the actual code for the Lasso Regression, RSS, and plotting.
    You need to replace the placeholders with your actual data.
    Also, the code block assumes that you have a function `RSS(y_test - yHat4_new_test)` that calculates the RSS for a given model and a test set.
    The code block also assumes that you have a function `lasso(X4, y, 10, tol=1e-6)` that performs Lasso Regression with a regularization parameter of 10 and a
