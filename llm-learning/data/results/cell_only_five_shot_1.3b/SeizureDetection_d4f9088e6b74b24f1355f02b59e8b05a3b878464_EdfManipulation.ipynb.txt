    The function `read_and_store_data` is designed to read and store the data from the EDF files. The EDF files are converted to CSV files using the `pyedflib` library. The function `readEdfFile` is used to read the EDF files and return a numpy array containing the data. The function `get_seizure_period` is a placeholder function that should be implemented to extract the start and length of the seizure from the seizure file.

    The function `read_and_store_data` reads the data from the EDF files, stores it in a pandas DataFrame, and returns the DataFrame. The DataFrame contains the data from the EDF files, along with a column indicating whether a seizure occurred.

    The function `read_and_store_data` uses the `os` and `os.path` modules to navigate through the directory structure and read the EDF files. It also uses the `pyedflib` library to read the EDF files and convert them to CSV files.

    The function `read_and_store_data` uses the `numpy` and `pandas` modules to handle the data and store it in a DataFrame. The DataFrame is then returned by the function.
