    The code you provided is a Python script for a stock price prediction using a LSTM model. It uses the Keras library for the model building and training, and the seaborn library for data visualization.

    The script starts by importing necessary libraries and modules. It then sets up the parameters for the plotting and the window size for the prediction. It fetches the stock price data, plots it, and normalizes the data.

    The script then splits the data into a training set and a test set. It builds a LSTM model and trains it on the training data. The model is then used to predict the stock prices for the test set.

    Finally, the script plots the predicted stock prices against the actual prices, and calculates the root mean squared error (RMSE) for both the training and test sets.

    The script is quite clean and does not contain any unnecessary code or comments. However, it does use a lot of variables and functions, which could be considered as a part of the code.

    The LSTM model is trained for 20 epochs, with a batch size of 16. The model is evaluated on the test set and the RMSE is calculated for both the training and test sets.

    The script ends with a call to the `plot_reg_results` function, which is used to plot the predicted stock prices against the actual prices.

    The script is not using any Git Large File Storage (LFS) for any files, as it is not necessary for this script.
