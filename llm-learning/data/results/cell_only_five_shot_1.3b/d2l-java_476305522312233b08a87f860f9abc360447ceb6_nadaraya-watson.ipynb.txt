```java
    // Shape of `xTile`: (`nTrain`, `nTrain`), where each column contains the
    // same training inputs
    NDArray xTile = xTrain.tile(new long[] {nTrain, 1});
    // Shape of `Y_tile`: (`nTrain`, `nTrain`), where each column contains the
    // same training outputs
    NDArray yTile = yTrain.tile(new long[] {nTrain, 1});
    // Shape of `keys`: ('nTrain', 'nTrain' - 1)
    NDArray keys =
        xTile.get((manager.eye(nTrain).mul(-1).add(1))).reshape(new Shape(nTrain, -1));
    // Shape of `values`: ('nTrain', 'nTrain' - 1)
    values = yTile.get((manager.eye(nTrain).mul(-1).add(1))).reshape(new Shape(nTrain, -1));
    ```

    The code above is a part of a larger codebase and is used to perform some operations on two NDArrays, `xTrain` and `yTrain`, which are used to train a model. The `xTile` and `yTile` arrays are created by repeating the `xTrain` and `yTrain` arrays respectively. The `keys` and `values` arrays are created by extracting the same training inputs and outputs from the `xTile` and `yTile` arrays respectively.
