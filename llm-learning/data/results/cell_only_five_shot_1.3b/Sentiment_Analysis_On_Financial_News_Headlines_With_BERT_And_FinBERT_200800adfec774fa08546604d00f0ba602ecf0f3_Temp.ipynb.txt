    ### Response:
    # You can add files via the upload feature in the Jupyter notebook.
    # To do this, you need to have a file manager open in your browser.
    # Once you have the file manager open, you can drag and drop the file you want to add into the cell below.

    # For example, if you have a CSV file named "data.csv" in your current directory, you can add it like this:

    ```python
    import pandas as pd

    # Load the CSV file
    df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

    # Display the first 5 rows of the DataFrame
    print(df.head())
    ```

    # You can also add files from your local machine or Google Drive.
    # To do this, you need to have the file manager open in your browser.
    # Once you have the file manager open, you can drag and drop the file you want to add into the cell below.

    # For example, if you have a CSV file named "data.csv" in your current directory, you can add it like this:

    ```python
    import pandas as pd

    # Load the CSV file
    df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

    # Display the first 5 rows of the DataFrame
    print(df.head())
    ```

    # Please note that the file manager may not be available in all browsers.
    # Also, the file manager may not support drag and drop.
    # In such cases, you can manually upload the file by clicking on the "Upload" button in the file manager and selecting the file.

    # After adding the file, you can run the code in the cell below.

    # For example, if you have a CSV file named "data.csv" in your current directory, you can add it like this:

    ```python
    import pandas as pd

    # Load the CSV file
