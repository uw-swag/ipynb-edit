```python
    # Refactor condition names
    ## Original Code:
    if condition_name == 'condition1':
        ## Code here

    elif condition_name == 'condition2':
        ## Code here

    elif condition_name == 'condition3':
        ## Code here

    else:
        ## Code here

    ## Refactored Code:
    if condition_name == 'condition1':
        pass
    elif condition_name == 'condition2':
        pass
    elif condition_name == 'condition3':
        pass
    else:
        pass
    ```
