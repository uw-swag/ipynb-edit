```
    from deepchecks.checks import StringMismatchComparison
    import pandas as pd

    data = {'col1': ['Deep', 'deep', 'deep!!!', 'earth', 'foo', 'bar', 'foo?']}
    compared_data = {'col1': ['Deep', 'deep', '$deeP$', 'earth', 'foo', 'bar', 'foo?', '?deep']}

    StringMismatchComparison().run(pd.DataFrame(data=data), pd.DataFrame(data=compared_data))
    ```

    The code above is a demonstration of how to use the `StringMismatchComparison` check in DeepChecks, a library for data quality checks. The `run` method is used to execute the check on the two input dataframes. The check compares the strings in the 'col1' column and identifies any strings that are not identical.

    Please note that the '$deeP$' and '?deep' in the compared_data are not identical to the 'Deep' and 'deep' in the data, respectively. The '$deeP$' and '?deep' are not identical to the 'Deep' and 'deep' in the data, respectively.

    The check returns a DataFrame with the mismatched strings and their corresponding positions.

    The `StringMismatchComparison` check is a part of the DeepChecks library and can be used in a variety of data quality checks.
