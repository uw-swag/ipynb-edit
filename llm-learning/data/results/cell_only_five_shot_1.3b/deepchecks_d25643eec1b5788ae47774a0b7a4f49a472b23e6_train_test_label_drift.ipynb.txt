```python
    from deepchecks.vision.utils.classification_formatters import ClassificationLabelFormatter

    train_ds = VisionData(mnist_dataloader_train, label_transformer=ClassificationLabelFormatter(lambda x: x))
    test_ds = VisionData(mnist_dataloader_test, label_transformer=ClassificationLabelFormatter(lambda x: x))
    ```

    The code above is a part of a Deepchecks library, specifically, the `VisionData` class. The `ClassificationLabelFormatter` is a utility class that is used to format the labels of the data. The `lambda x: x` is a function that takes a label and returns the same label. This is a common formatter for classification tasks where the labels are integers.

    However, the code you provided is not valid Python code. It seems to be a part of a Jupyter notebook or a similar environment where the code is not executed. The code is meant to be used in a Python environment.
