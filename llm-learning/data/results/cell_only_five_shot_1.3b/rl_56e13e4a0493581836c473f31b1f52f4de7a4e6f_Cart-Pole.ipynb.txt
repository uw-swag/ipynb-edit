    Your code seems to be incomplete and doesn't seem to contain any errors. It's a Python code for training an Actor-Critic agent using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) method. The agent is trained on the CartPole environment, and the results are plotted using matplotlib.

    The code is divided into several sections:

    1. Importing necessary libraries and modules.
    2. Defining the Actor-Critic agent class.
    3. Defining the environment and the agent.
    4. Training the agent.
    5. Plotting the results.
