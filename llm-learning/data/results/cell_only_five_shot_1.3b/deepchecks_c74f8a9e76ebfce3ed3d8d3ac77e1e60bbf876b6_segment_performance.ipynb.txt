    The `cat_features` parameter is a list of column names that should be treated as categorical.

    The `iterations` parameter is the number of trees to build in the booster.

    The `silent` parameter is a boolean flag that, if set to True, suppresses the output of the training process.

    The `fit` method is used to train the model.

    The `train_ds.features_columns()` and `train_ds.label_col()` are used to train the model.

    The `train_ds` is a dataset object that contains the training data.

    The `features_columns` method is a function that returns the features of the dataset.

    The `label_col` method is a function that returns the label of the dataset.

    The `cat_features` is a list of column names that should be treated as categorical.

    The `iterations` is the number of trees to build in the booster.

    The `silent` is a boolean flag that, if set to True, suppresses the output of the training process.
