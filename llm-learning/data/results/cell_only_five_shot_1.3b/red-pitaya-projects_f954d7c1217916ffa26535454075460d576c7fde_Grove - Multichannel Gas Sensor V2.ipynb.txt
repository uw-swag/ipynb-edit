    The code you provided is a Python script for a BME680 sensor to estimate indoor air quality. The script uses the BME680 sensor to measure temperature, pressure, humidity, and gas resistance. The script then calculates an air quality score based on the relative humidity and gas resistance.

    The script is divided into two parts:

    1. The first part of the script is for the sensor setup and data collection. It sets up the sensor with the specified I2C address and enables the gas sensor. It also sets the oversampling settings and starts collecting data.

    2. The second part of the script is for the data processing and the air quality score calculation. It prints the sensor data, calculates the air quality score based on the relative humidity and gas resistance, and then waits for a short period before collecting the next set of data.

    The script uses the time module to control the data collection rate. The script runs for 300 seconds (5 minutes) before starting to collect data, and then uses the average of the last 50 gas resistance readings to set the gas baseline.

    The air quality score is calculated as the sum of the humidity score and the gas score, with the humidity score being the distance from the humidity baseline and the gas score being the distance from the gas baseline. The gas score is multiplied by a weighting factor to balance the two scores.

    The script is designed to run continuously, collecting data and calculating the air quality score every second.

    The script uses the smbus module to communicate with the BME680 sensor.
