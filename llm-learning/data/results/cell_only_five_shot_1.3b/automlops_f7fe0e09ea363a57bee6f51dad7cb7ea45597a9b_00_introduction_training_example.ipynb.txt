    The original code is not provided, but I can provide a general suggestion. The copyright year in the code should be updated to the current year. Here's how you can do it:

    ```python
    # Copyright 2023 Google LLC
    #
    # Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");
    # you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

    # WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.

    ```

    This is a general suggestion and might not apply to your specific code. You should replace the copyright year with the current year.
