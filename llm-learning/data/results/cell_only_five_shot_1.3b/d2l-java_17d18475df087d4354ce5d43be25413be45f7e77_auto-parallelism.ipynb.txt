    The commit message "bump of D2L Java book version to 0.8.0 (#58)" is a request to bump the version of the D2L Java book to 0.8.0. This is a common practice when releasing a new version of a project.

    The original code cells are Maven commands that are used to manage dependencies for the D2L Java book. The commands are:

    - `%mavenRepo snapshots https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/`: This command is used to set the repository for SNAPSHOT dependencies.

    - `%maven ai.djl:api:0.7.0-SNAPSHOT`, `%maven ai.djl:model-zoo:0.7.0-SNAPSHOT`, `%maven ai.djl:basicdataset:0.7.0-SNAPSHOT`: These commands are used to add the SNAPSHOT version of the ai.djl dependencies to the Maven repository.

    - `%maven org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.26`, `%maven org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:1.7.26`: These commands are used to add the SLF4J dependencies to the Maven repository.

    - `%maven ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-engine:0.7.0-SNAPSHOT`, `%maven ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-native-auto:1.7.0-b`: These commands are used to add the SNAPSHOT version of the ai.djl.mxnet dependencies to the Maven repository.

    The `#58` in the commit message is a reference to the issue that this version of the book is based on.

    Please note that the actual version numbers and the specific changes made to the book will depend on the version of the ai.djl and ai.djl.mxnet libraries that are used in the book.
