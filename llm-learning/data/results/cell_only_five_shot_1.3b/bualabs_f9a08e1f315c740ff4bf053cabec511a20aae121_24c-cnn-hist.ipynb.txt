The code you provided is a PyTorch implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The code includes the initialization of the model with Kaiming He's initialization, and the change of the histogram bin to include negative values.

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. The code imports necessary libraries and modules.
2. It defines the callback functions for the `Runner`.
3. It creates a CNN model using the `get_cnn_model` function.
4. It initializes the optimizer and the learning rate for the model.
5. It creates a `Learner` object using the model, optimizer, and loss function.
6. It creates a `Runner` object with the callback functions.
7. It creates a second CNN model using the `get_cnn_model2` function.
8. It initializes the optimizer and the learning rate for the second model.
9. It creates a second `Learner` object using the second model, optimizer, and loss function.
10. It creates a second `Runner` object with the callback functions.
11. It creates a histogram plot for the first 4 hooks.
12. It creates a plot for the minimum values of the first 4 hooks.

The histogram plot shows the distribution of the gradients in the model, and the plot of the minimum values shows the change in the model's parameters as the learning progresses.

Please note that the code you provided is a part of a larger codebase and it's not clear what the purpose of the code is. The histogram plot and the plot of the minimum values are used to monitor the learning process of the model.
