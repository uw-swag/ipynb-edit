```
    # transform = get_transforms(do_flip=False, flip_vert=False, max_rotate=0.0, max_zoom=1.0, max_lighting=0.0, max_warp=0.0, p_affine=0.0, p_lighting=0.0)
    transform = zoom_crop(scale=(1.0,1.0), do_rand=False)
    databunch = get_databunch(transform)
    learner = cnn_learner(databunch, models.vgg16_bn, ps=0.0, wd=0.0, 
                          metrics=accuracy, callback_fns=ShowGraph).to_fp16()
    plots_f(3, 3, 9, 9, size=224)
    ```

    The code you provided seems to be correct. It first defines a transformation, then uses that transformation to create a databunch, and finally trains a model using that databunch. The `plots_f` function is not defined in the provided code, but it seems to be a function that plots some images. If you're seeing an error or unexpected behavior, please provide more context or the definition of `plots_f`.
