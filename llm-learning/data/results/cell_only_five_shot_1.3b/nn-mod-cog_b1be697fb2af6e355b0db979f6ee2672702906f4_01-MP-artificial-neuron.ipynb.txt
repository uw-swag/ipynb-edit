    ## Extending the Multiple-Partite Model (MP)

    The Multiple-Partite Model (MP) is a statistical model that is used to model the joint distribution of a set of random variables. It is a generalization of the Multiple-Partite Model, which is a model used to model the joint distribution of two or more random variables.
