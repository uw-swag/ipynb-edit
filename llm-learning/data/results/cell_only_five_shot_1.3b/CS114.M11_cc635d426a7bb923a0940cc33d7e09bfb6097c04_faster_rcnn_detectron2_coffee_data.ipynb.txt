```python
    # Add faster-rcnn
    # This is a simplified example, you may need to adjust it according to your needs
    from faster_rcnn import faster_rcnn
    model = faster_rcnn()

    # Add app
    from app import app
    app.run(debug=True)
    ```

    Please note that the `faster_rcnn` function is a placeholder for a function that you would need to implement. The `app` function is a placeholder for a Flask application. You would need to implement these functions according to your specific requirements.
