The provided code is a Jupyter notebook that uses the AtomAI library to perform image augmentation. The augmentation process includes zooming, rotating, and applying Gaussian and Poisson noise. The augmented images and their corresponding labels are then saved to a .npz file.

The original code is not provided, but I can see that the notebook is using the AtomAI library to perform image augmentation. The augmentation process includes zooming, rotating, and applying Gaussian and Poisson noise. The augmented images and their corresponding labels are then saved to a .npz file.

The notebook also includes code to download a Google Drive link, load an image, and perform some operations on the image. The operations include creating a lattice mask, extracting patches from the image, and applying some transformations to the image.

The notebook also includes code to split the data into training and testing sets, and to save the augmented data to a .npz file.
