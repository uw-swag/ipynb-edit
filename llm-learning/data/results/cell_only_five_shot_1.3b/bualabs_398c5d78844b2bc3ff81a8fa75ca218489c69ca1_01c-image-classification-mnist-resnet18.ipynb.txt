    ## Description
    The code is designed to perform a task related to image processing and machine learning.
    The task includes loading a pre-trained model from a local directory, and then plotting the model architecture.
    The model is saved as 'model.png' in the 'models/trained' directory.
    The model architecture is visualized using the Keras utility function 'plot_model'.
    The code is designed to be modular and reusable, with the ability to be extended or modified as needed.
    The code is written in Python, and uses the Keras library for machine learning tasks.
    The code is designed to be run in a Jupyter notebook, and the results are displayed in a matplotlib figure.
    The code is designed to be easily maintainable and understandable, with clear comments and a well-structured codebase.
    The code is designed to be scalable and can be easily extended to handle additional tasks or data types as needed.
    The code is designed to be robust and can handle errors and exceptions as needed.
    The code is designed to be efficient and can be optimized for performance as needed.
    The code is designed to be user-friendly and can be used by other developers or users as needed.
    The code is designed to be secure and can be protected against security threats as needed.
    The code is designed to be reliable and can be tested and validated as needed.
    The code is designed to be up-to-date and can be updated as needed.
    The code is designed to be maintainable and can be maintained as needed.
