```python
    from azureml.core import Workspace, Dataset

    # Load the workspace from the saved config file
    ws = Workspace.from_config()

    # Create a new dataset from your local file
    dataset = Dataset.from_local_file("path_to_your_file.csv")

    # Register the dataset
    dataset = dataset.register(workspace=ws,
                               name="your_dataset_name",
                               description="Your dataset description",
                               tags={'format': 'CSV'},

    ### Response:
    Here is an example of how you can add a new notebook to your Azure Machine Learning workspace.

    ```python
    from azureml.core import Workspace, Dataset, Experiment

    # Load the workspace from the saved config file
    ws = Workspace.from_config()

    # Create a new experiment
    experiment = Experiment(workspace=ws, name="my_experiment")

    # Create a new notebook
    notebook = experiment.create_notebook_instance(instance_name='my_notebook',
                                                  notebook_name='my_notebook',
                                                  storage_connection_string=ws.get_connection_string(name='my_notebook_connection'))

    # Upload a local file to the notebook
    notebook.upload_file('path_to_your_file.ipynb', 'my_notebook')
    ```

    This code will create a new notebook instance in your Azure Machine Learning workspace, upload a local file to the notebook, and then start the notebook instance.

    Please replace `'path_to_your_file.ipynb'` with the path to your notebook file, and `'my_notebook'` with the name of your notebook.

    Also, make sure you have the necessary permissions to create and upload notebooks to your Azure Machine Learning workspace.
