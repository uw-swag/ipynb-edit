    The code you provided is a Python script for a deep learning project. It uses TensorFlow and Keras to build a neural network for image classification. The script includes tasks such as loading and preprocessing data, building and training a neural network, and evaluating the network's performance.

    The script also includes tasks such as visualizing the gradients of the loss function, applying a Gaussian filter to the image, and applying a total variation filter to the image.

    The script also includes tasks such as downloading and using a pre-trained VGG16 model, and applying the stylization technique to the image.

    The script also includes tasks such as training a neural network for a number of iterations, and visualizing the results of the training process.

    The script also includes tasks such as generating a GIF of the training process, and displaying the GIF.

    The script also includes tasks such as generating a GIF of the stylization process, and displaying the GIF.

    The script also includes tasks such as generating a GIF of the final result, and displaying the GIF.
