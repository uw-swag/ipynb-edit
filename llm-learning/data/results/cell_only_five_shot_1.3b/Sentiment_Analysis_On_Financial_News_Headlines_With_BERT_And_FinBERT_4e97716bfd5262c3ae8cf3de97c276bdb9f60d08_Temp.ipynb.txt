    ## Adding files via upload

    # You can add files via the upload feature in the Jupyter notebook. Here's how you can do it:

    ### Code:
    ```python
    from IPython.display import FileUpload
    upload = FileUpload()
    upload
    ```

    ### Explanation:
    The `FileUpload` function from the `IPython.display` module allows you to upload files to your notebook. You can then use the `upload` variable to access the uploaded files.

    Please note that the `FileUpload` function will only work in a Jupyter notebook environment. If you're running this code in a different environment, you'll need to use a different method to upload files.

    Also, the uploaded files will be stored in the location where you run your notebook. If you want to save the uploaded files to a different location, you can specify the path in the `FileUpload` function.

    For example, to save the uploaded file to the current directory, you can use:

    ```python
    from IPython.display import FileUpload
    upload = FileUpload(save_as='my_file.txt')
    upload
    ```

    This will save the uploaded file as 'my_file.txt' in the current directory.

    Please replace 'my_file.txt' with the actual name you want to give to the uploaded file.

    This is a basic example. Depending on your needs, you may need to handle the uploaded files in a more complex way.
