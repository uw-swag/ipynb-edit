The code you provided is a TensorFlow program that trains a classifier for Reber sequences. The classifier is trained for a number of epochs, and then the trained classifier is saved to a file named "my_reber_classifier". 

The program then tests the trained classifier on a set of test strings, and prints the estimated probability that these are Reber strings.

The issue you're facing is that the path to the classifier is incorrect. The path to the classifier should be "my_reber_classifier" not "my_reber_classifier.ckpt". 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
n_epochs = 50
batch_size = 50

with tf.Session() as sess:
    init.run()
    for epoch in range(n_epochs):
        X_batches = np.array_split(X_train, len(X_train) // batch_size)
        l_batches = np.array_split(l_train, len(l_train) // batch_size)
        y_batches = np.array_split(y_train, len(y_train) // batch_size)
        for X_batch, l_batch, y_batch in zip(X_batches, l_batches, y_batches):
            loss_val, _ = sess.run(
                [loss, training_op],
                feed_dict={X: X_batch, seq_length: l_batch, y: y_batch})
        acc_train = accuracy.eval(feed_dict={X: X_batch, seq_length: l_batch, y: y_batch})
        acc_val = accuracy.eval(feed_dict={X: X_val, seq_length: l_val, y: y_val})
        print("{:4d}  Train loss: {:.4f}, accuracy: {:.2f}%  Validation accuracy: {:.2f}%".format(
            epoch, loss_val, 100 * acc_train, 100 * acc_val))
        saver.save(sess, "my_reber_
