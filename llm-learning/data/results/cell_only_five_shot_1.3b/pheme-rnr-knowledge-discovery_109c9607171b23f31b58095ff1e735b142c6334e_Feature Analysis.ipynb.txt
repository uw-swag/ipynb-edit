    ## Feature Analysis Notebook

This notebook is designed to perform feature analysis on the German Wing crash data. The data is loaded from a CSV file, and the target variable (is_rumor) is defined as 1 for rumor-related events and 0 for non-rumor-related events.

The first section of the notebook is a data loading and exploration section. It reads the data from the CSV file, and then it drops unnecessary columns. The target variable (is_rumor) is defined as 1 for rumor-related events and 0 for non-rumor-related events.

The second section of the notebook is a feature visualization section. It uses seaborn to create a count plot of the target variable, and then it normalizes the features. The normalized features are then melted into a long format DataFrame for further analysis.

The third section of the notebook is a feature correlation section. It uses seaborn to create a heatmap of the correlation between the features and the target variable.

The fourth section of the notebook is a feature distribution section. It uses seaborn to create a violin plot and a box plot for each feature, with the target variable colored by the event type.

The fifth section of the notebook is a feature distribution section. It uses seaborn to create a violin plot and a box plot for each feature, with the target variable colored by the event type.

The final section of the notebook is a feature distribution section. It uses seaborn to create a violin plot and a box plot for each feature, with the target variable colored by the event type.

The notebook is designed to be interactive, and the user can zoom in and out of the plots, and the color of the boxes and violins can be changed.

Please note that this notebook is a basic template and may need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of your project.
