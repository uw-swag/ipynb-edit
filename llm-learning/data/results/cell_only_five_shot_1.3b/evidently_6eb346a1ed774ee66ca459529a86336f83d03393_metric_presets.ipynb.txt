    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the evidently library to create a report for a machine learning model. The report includes metrics for data integrity, data quality, regression performance, and classification performance.

    The code is divided into several sections:

    1. Data loading and preprocessing: The code loads the adult dataset from the sklearn datasets and preprocesses the data by adding random noise to the 'education-num' column.

    2. Data drift: The code creates a report for data drift by comparing the reference and current data.

    3. Regression performance: The code creates a report for regression performance by comparing the reference and current data.

    4. Classification performance: The code creates a report for classification performance by comparing the reference and current data.

    5. Data quality: The code creates a report for data quality by comparing the reference and current data.

    6. Data integrity: The code creates a report for data integrity by comparing the reference and current data.

    The code also includes a section for evaluating the text to be more clear.
