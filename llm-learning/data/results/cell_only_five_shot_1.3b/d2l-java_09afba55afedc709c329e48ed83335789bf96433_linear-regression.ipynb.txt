    It seems like you're trying to upgrade your Maven project to version 0.11.0. However, the provided code is not valid Maven POM (Project Object Model) file. 

    Maven POM files are used to store metadata for Maven projects, such as project name, description, and dependencies. They are used to manage dependencies and build processes.

    The code you provided is not a valid Maven POM file. It seems like you're trying to add dependencies to your Maven project, but the code is not valid.

    If you're trying to upgrade your Maven project, you should use the Maven `mvn versions:update-properties` command. This command will update the version of your project in the POM file.

    Here's an example of how you can use it:

    ```
    mvn versions:update-properties
    ```

    This command will update the version of your project in the POM file to the next minor version.

    If you're trying to add a new dependency, you should use the Maven `mvn dependency:tree` command. This command will show you the dependency tree of your project, and you can add a new dependency to it.

    Here's an example of how you can use it:

    ```
    mvn dependency:tree
    ```

    This command will show you the dependency tree of your project, and you can add a new dependency to it.

    Please provide more context or clarify your question if you need further assistance.
