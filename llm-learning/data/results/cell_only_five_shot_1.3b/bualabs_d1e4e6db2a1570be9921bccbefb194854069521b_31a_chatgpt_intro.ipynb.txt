```python
    def get_completion(prompt):
        # This function is a placeholder. It will be replaced with the actual function that uses the OpenAI API to get the completion of a prompt.
        # For now, it just returns the prompt itself.
        return prompt

    resp = get_completion("Explain why Thailand is such as good place to retire.")
    print(resp)
