    The code you've provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the scikit-learn library to train an ExtraTreesClassifier on the Iris dataset, and then uses the model results to plot a confusion matrix, ROC curve, precision-recall curve, and feature importances.

    Here's a brief explanation of what each part of the code does:

    - The code imports necessary libraries and loads the Iris dataset.
    - The Iris dataset is converted into a binary classification problem.
    - The noisy features are added to the dataset.
    - The dataset is split into a training set and a test set.
    - The ExtraTreesClassifier is trained on the training set.
    - The model results are created using the trained model and the test set.
    - The confusion matrix, ROC curve, precision-recall curve, and feature importances are plotted.

    The notebook is designed to be interactive, so you can run the code and see the results in real-time.

    The updated readme file would include:
