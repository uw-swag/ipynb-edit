```python
    # Convert the notebook to a .ipynb file
    !jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --inplace 'Your_Notebook_Name.ipynb'

    # Add a 'k2s' command to the notebook
    # This command is used to convert a Keras model to a TensorFlow SavedModel
    # The model should be a Keras model
    # The SavedModel will be saved in the same directory as the notebook
    # The name of the SavedModel will be the same as the name of the notebook
    # The format of the SavedModel will be 'Keras'
    # The version of the SavedModel will be the same as the version of the notebook
    # The name of the SavedModel will be the same as the name of the notebook
    # The format of the SavedModel will be 'TensorFlow'
    # The version of the SavedModel will be the same as the version of the notebook
    # The name of the SavedModel will be the same as the name of the notebook
    # The format of the SavedModel will be 'TensorFlow'
    # The version of the SavedModel will be the same as the version of the notebook
    # The name of the SavedModel will be the same as the name of the notebook
    # The format of the SavedModel will be 'TensorFlow'
    # The version of the SavedModel will be the same as the version of the notebook
    # The name of the SavedModel will be the same as the name of the notebook
    # The format of the SavedModel will be 'TensorFlow'
    # The version of the SavedModel will be the same as the version of the notebook
    # The name of the SavedModel will be the same as the name of the notebook
    # The format of the SavedModel will be 'TensorFlow'
    # The version of the SavedModel will be the same as the version of the notebook
    # The name of the SavedModel will be the same as the name of the notebook
    # The format of the SavedModel will be 'TensorFlow'
