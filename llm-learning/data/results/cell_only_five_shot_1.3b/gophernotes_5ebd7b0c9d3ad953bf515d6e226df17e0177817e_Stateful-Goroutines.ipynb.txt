    The code you provided is a simple example of a concurrent map and atomic operations in Go. It uses goroutines to simulate multiple concurrent operations on a shared map. The map is read and written to by multiple goroutines, and the operations are atomic to ensure they don't interfere with each other.

    The code also includes a sleep to allow the goroutines to run for a second before printing the final number of operations.

    The commit message "new example and new install docs" suggests that a new example and installation documentation have been added.

    The original code is not provided, but I can't provide a new example or install documentation as it's not clear what the new example and install documentation are.
