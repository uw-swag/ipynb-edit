    The function `string_mismatch` is a custom function that checks for string mismatches in the 'col1' column of the DataFrame. It returns a list of rows where the string mismatch is detected.

    The function is designed to handle a wide range of string mismatches, including but not limited to:
    - Case sensitivity
    - Special characters
    - Whitespace
    - Different length of strings

    The function uses regular expressions to identify and return the rows where the string mismatch is detected.

    Please note that the function is case-sensitive, and it also considers special characters and whitespace. If you want to modify the function to ignore case, special characters, or whitespace, you can do so by modifying the regular expression used in the function.

    Also, the function is case-sensitive, and it also considers special characters and whitespace. If you want to modify the function to ignore case, special characters, or whitespace, you can do so by modifying the regular expression used in the function.
