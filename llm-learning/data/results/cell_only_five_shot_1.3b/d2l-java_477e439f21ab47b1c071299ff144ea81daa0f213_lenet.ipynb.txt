    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook, and it's using the DL4J library, which is a deep learning library for Java. The code is upgrading the DL4J version to 0.13.0.

    However, the code you provided is not a complete Jupyter notebook, it's a part of a larger code. If you want to upgrade the DL4J version, you would need to replace the code in the larger code with the new version.

    If you want to upgrade DL4J, you can do it by replacing the version in the Maven dependency in your pom.xml file. Here's how you can do it:

    ```xml
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.deeplearning4j</groupId>
            <artifactId>deeplearning4j-core</artifactId>
            <version>0.13.0</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    ```

    After replacing the version, you can run `mvn clean install` to update the dependency in your project.

    Please note that this is a general guide and the actual process may vary depending on your project setup.
