    The original code is a plot of a 3D surface plot of a perceptron and an Adaline. The perceptron is a simple linear classifier that maps inputs to outputs. The Adaline is a linear classifier that is based on the perceptron, but with a small modification to make it work for larger datasets.

    The equations for the perceptron and Adaline are as follows:

    Perceptron:
    f(x) = 1 if x >= 0 else -1

    Adaline:
    f(x) = w^T * x + b

    where w is the weight vector and b is the bias.

    The equations are derived from the perceptron and Adaline learning algorithms.
