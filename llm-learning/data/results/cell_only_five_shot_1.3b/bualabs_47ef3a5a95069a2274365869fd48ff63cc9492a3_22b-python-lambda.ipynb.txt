    A lambda function is a small anonymous function that is defined with the lambda keyword. Lambda functions are used when you want to use a function for a short period of time, but you don't want to define it with the def keyword.

    In the given code, a lambda function is used to filter the elements of the list `s` that are greater than 20. The lambda function `lambda x: x > 20` is used to check if a number `x` is greater than 20. The `filter` function is used to apply this lambda function to each element of the list `s` and only keep the elements for which the lambda function returns `True`.

    The `list` function is used to convert the result back into a list.

    The result of the `filter` function is a list of elements from `s` that are greater than 20. This list is then printed to the console.

    Here is the complete code:

    ```python
    s = [3, 22, 1, 32, 24, 49, 11, 26, 20, 0, 10]
    result = filter(lambda x: x > 20, s)
    print(list(result))
    ```

    This will output:

    ```python
    [32, 24, 49, 26, 20, 10]
    ```

    These are the elements of `s` that are greater than 20.
