```python
    from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

    # Create a CountVectorizer object
    vectorizer = CountVectorizer()

    # Fit the vectorizer to the data
    X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)

    # Get the feature names
    feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()

    # Get the term-document matrix
    term_doc_matrix = X.todense()

    # Print the term-document matrix
    print(term_doc_matrix)
    ```

    The term-document matrix is a matrix where each row represents a document and each column represents a term. The value at a given row and column represents the frequency of the term in the document.

    The `CountVectorizer` class from the `sklearn.feature_extraction.text` module is used to create a term-document matrix. The `fit_transform` method is used to fit the vectorizer to the data and then transform the data into the term-document matrix. The `todense` method is used to convert the sparse term-document matrix to a dense matrix.

    The resulting term-document matrix can be used for various natural language processing tasks, such as text classification, text clustering, and text summarization.
