    ### 01 Chapter: Introduction

    In this chapter, we will explore the concept of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its application in the field of movie review analysis. We will start by loading and cleaning the data, then move on to the process of vectorizing the text data. We will then use Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) as our model, and evaluate its performance.

    ### 02 Chapter: Data Loading and Cleaning

    We start by loading the labeled training data and the test data. The data is in the form of tab-separated values (TSV) files, which are text files with fields separated by tabs. The 'review' column contains the text of the reviews, and the 'sentiment' column contains the sentiment of the reviews (positive or negative).

    The cleaning process involves several steps:

    1. Text cleaning: We use BeautifulSoup to remove HTML tags and other non-alphabetic characters from the text.

    2. Word extraction: We extract the words from the text, convert them to lower case, and remove stop words (common words like 'and', 'the', 'is', etc.).

    ### 03 Chapter: Vectorizing the Text Data

    We use the CountVectorizer class from the sklearn.feature_extraction.text module to vectorize the text data. This class converts a collection of text documents to a matrix of token counts.

    ### 04 Chapter: Model Training

    We train our model on the vectorized training data. We use the Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) class from the sklearn.naive_bayes module.

    ### 05 Chapter: Model Evaluation

    We evaluate the performance of our model on the validation data. We use the roc_auc_score function from the sklearn.metrics module to calculate the area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).

    ### 06 Chapter: Model Deployment

    We deploy our model to predict the sentiment of movie reviews. We use the predict_proba function to get the probabilities of the positive and negative classes.

    ### 07 Chapter: Conclusion
