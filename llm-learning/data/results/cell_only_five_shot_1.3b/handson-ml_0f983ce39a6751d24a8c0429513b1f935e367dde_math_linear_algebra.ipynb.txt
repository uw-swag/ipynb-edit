    The right angle is pi/2, not pi/4. One reason why tau > pi is because tau is a constant in the math library, and it's defined as 2*pi. This means that if you divide 2*pi by tau, you'll get 1, which is not equal to pi/4.

    Here's a simple Python code to demonstrate this:

    ```python
    import math

    tau = math.pi * 2
    angle = tau / 4

    print(angle)
    ```

    This will output 0.25, which is not equal to pi/4.

    The reason is that tau is a constant in the math library, and it's defined as 2*pi. If you divide 2*pi by tau, you'll get 1, which is not equal to pi/4.

    This is a simple demonstration of why tau > pi.
