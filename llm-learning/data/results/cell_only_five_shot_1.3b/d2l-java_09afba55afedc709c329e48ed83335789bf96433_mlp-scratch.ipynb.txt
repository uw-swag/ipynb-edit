    The code you provided is a Java code snippet for a machine learning model using the Deep Java Library (DJL) and the Tablesaw library. 

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    1. The code imports necessary libraries and classes.
    2. It defines the batch size, number of inputs, outputs, and hidden units.
    3. It creates a training and test dataset using the FashionMnist dataset from DJL.
    4. It initializes the weights and biases for the neural network.
    5. It trains the network for a number of epochs with a learning rate.
    6. It calculates the training and test loss and accuracy for each epoch.
    7. It plots the loss and accuracy over epochs.

    The code uses the Tablesaw library to create a table with the loss and accuracy data and plot it.

    Please note that the code is written in Java and uses the DJL library for machine learning. The Tablesaw library is used for data manipulation and visualization.

    The code is a simple example of a neural network for image classification using the MNIST dataset. It's a good starting point for understanding how to build a neural network from scratch.
