    The code you've provided is a Jupyter notebook that contains several cells. Here's a brief explanation of what each cell does:

1. The first cell imports necessary libraries and modules. It also sets up warnings to ignore any potential issues.

2. The second cell imports the necessary libraries and modules for data manipulation and analysis.

3. The third cell imports the necessary libraries and modules for machine learning.

4. The fourth cell imports the necessary libraries and modules for image processing.

5. The fifth cell imports the necessary libraries and modules for deep learning.

6. The sixth cell imports the necessary libraries and modules for neural network models.

7. The seventh cell defines a function to one-hot encode categorical variables.

8. The eighth cell defines a function to split the data into training, validation, and test sets.

9. The ninth cell defines a function to plot the history of a model.

10. The tenth cell loads the image data and labels from the HDF5 file.

11. The eleventh cell defines a function to build a VGG16 model.

12. The twelfth cell defines a function to build a VGG19 model.

13. The thirteenth cell defines a function to build a ResNet152V2 model.

14. The fourteenth cell defines a function to train and evaluate a model.

15. The fifteenth cell defines a function to plot the history of a model.

16. The sixteenth cell defines a function to train and evaluate a model.

17. The seventeenth cell defines a function to plot the history of a model.

18. The eighteenth cell defines a function to train and evaluate a model.

19. The nineteenth cell defines a function to plot the history of a model.

20. The twentieth cell defines a function to train and evaluate a model.

21. The twenty-first cell defines a function to plot the history of a model.

22. The twenty-second cell defines a function to train and evaluate a model.

23. The twenty-third cell defines a function to plot the history of a model.
