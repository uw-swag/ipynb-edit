```python
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from sklearn.metrics import distribution_plot_2d

    # Assuming you have a model that returns a distribution
    model_distribution = model.predict_proba(X_test)

    # Convert the distribution to a numpy array
    model_distribution = np.array(model_distribution)

    # Plot the distribution
    distribution_plot_2d(model_distribution)
    plt.show()
    ```
    The above code will plot a 2D distribution of the predicted probabilities. The x-axis represents the predicted probability, and the y-axis represents the count of instances.

    Please note that the `model.predict_proba(X_test)` function is a placeholder for the actual model prediction. You need to replace it with your actual model.

    Also, the `distribution_plot_2d` function is a function from the `sklearn.metrics` module, which is used to plot a 2D distribution. You may need to adjust the code to fit your specific use case.

    The error distribution check is a common practice in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a model. It helps to understand the distribution of the predicted values and to identify any potential issues with the model's predictions.
