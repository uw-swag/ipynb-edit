    # Section 8.4: Recurrent Neural Networks
    ## 8.4.1: Introduction
    # Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of deep learning models that are capable of learning from sequences of data.
    # They are particularly useful for tasks that involve sequential data, such as time series analysis, natural language processing,
    # and more.

    ## 8.4.2: Recurrent Neural Networks
    # A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural network that is capable of learning from sequences of data.
    # The most common type of RNN is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is used in the field of natural language processing.

    ## 8.4.3: LSTM Model
    # The LSTM model is a type of RNN that is particularly suited to the problem of sequence prediction.
    # It has three gates: the input gate, forget gate, and output gate.
    # The input gate allows the model to increase the importance of recent inputs,
    # the forget gate allows the model to decrease the importance of recent inputs,
    # and the output gate allows the model to control the importance of recent inputs.

    ## 8.4.4: Training an LSTM Model
    # To train an LSTM model, you need to define a loss function, an optimizer, and a metric to evaluate the model's performance.
    # You also need to split your data into a training set and a validation set.

    ## 8.4.5: Using an LSTM Model
    # After training an LSTM model, you can use it to predict the next value in a sequence.
    # This is done by passing the current input to the model, and then using the model's output to compute the next input.

    ## 8.4.6: Conclusion
    # Recurrent Neural Networks are a powerful tool for tasks that involve sequential data,
    # such as time series analysis, natural language processing, and more.
    # They are also a good choice for tasks that involve temporal dependencies,
    # such as speech recognition or video processing.
