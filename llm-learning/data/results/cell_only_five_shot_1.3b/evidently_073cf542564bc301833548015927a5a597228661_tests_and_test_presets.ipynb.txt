    The code you provided is a part of the Evidently library, which is used for performance and quality assessment of machine learning models. The code is used to test the quality of a dataset, including the number of columns, rows, constant columns, duplicated columns, duplicated rows, column types, target features correlations, highly correlated columns, share of drifted columns, number of drifted columns, and feature level tests.

    The code is divided into several sections:

    1. Fetching and preparing the data.
    2. Running the tests.
    3. Printing the results.

    The tests are divided into two types:

    1. Dataset level tests: These tests check the quality of the entire dataset, such as the number of columns, rows, and constant columns.
    2. Feature level tests: These tests check the quality of individual features, such as the share of out-of-range values, the share of missing values, and the drift of columns.

    The code also includes tests for a No-Target-Performance test, a Data-Drift test, and a Data-Stability test.

    The results of the tests are printed at the end of the code.

    Please note that the code is written in Python and uses the Evidently library.

    The code is a good example of how to use the Evidently library for performance and quality assessment of machine learning models.

    The code is not runnable as it is, but it can be used as a reference for how to use the Evidently library.

    The code is a part of a larger project, and the actual performance and quality of the model will depend on the specifics of the data and the model used.

    The code is not optimized for performance, and it may not be suitable for large datasets.

    The code is not designed to be run in a Jupyter notebook, and it may not work as expected in a standalone Python script.
