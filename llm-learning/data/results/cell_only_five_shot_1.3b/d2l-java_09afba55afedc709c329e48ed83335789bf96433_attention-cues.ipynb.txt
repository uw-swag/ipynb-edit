    The code you provided is a Maven command to upgrade the version of a specific library to 0.11.0. However, it seems like there is no code provided in the original cells. 

    If you want to upgrade the version of a specific library, you can use the following Maven command:

    ```
    %maven ai.djl:api:0.11.0
    ```

    This command will upgrade the version of the `ai.djl:api` library to 0.11.0.

    If you want to upgrade all the versions of the libraries, you can use the following Maven command:

    ```
    %maven ai.djl:*:0.11.0
    ```

    This command will upgrade all the versions of the `ai.djl` libraries to 0.11.0.

    Please note that the `%maven` command is used to add dependencies to your Maven project. The `%maven` command is specific to the Apache Maven build tool. If you're not using Maven, you might need to use a different build tool or a different method to add dependencies.
