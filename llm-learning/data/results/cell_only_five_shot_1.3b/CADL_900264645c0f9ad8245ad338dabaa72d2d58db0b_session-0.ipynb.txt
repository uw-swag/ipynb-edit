    The code provided is a collection of instructions for a TensorFlow project. Here's a brief explanation of the changes:

    1. The code imports the necessary libraries and modules.
    2. It creates a directory named 'img_align_celeba' and downloads images from a URL.
    3. It reads the downloaded images and prints their paths.
    4. It displays the first image in the directory.
    5. It resizes the image to a square and displays it.
    6. It calculates the mean of the image and displays it.
    7. It crops the image to a square and resizes it.
    8. It creates a list of cropped images.
    9. It concatenates the images into a numpy array.
    10. It displays the first image in the array.

    The code is a simple example of how to work with image data in TensorFlow. It demonstrates how to load images, resize them, and manipulate them.
