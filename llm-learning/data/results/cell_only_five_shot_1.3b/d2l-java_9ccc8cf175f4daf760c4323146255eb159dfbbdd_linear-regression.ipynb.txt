The code you provided is a Java code snippet that uses the LinePlot component from the Tablesaw library to visualize the normal distributions of three sets of data, each with different mean and variance.

The `normal` method is used to calculate the probability density function of a normal distribution. The `combine3` method is used to combine three arrays into one.

The code then creates a new table with three columns: "z", "p(z)", and "params". The "z" column is the combined array of the three input arrays, the "p(z)" column is the calculated probability density function of the normal distribution, and the "params" column is a string that describes the mean and variance of each set of data.

Finally, the LinePlot component is created to visualize the data.

The code uses the `Arrays.fill` method to fill the "params" array with the specified parameters. The `Table.create` method is used to create a new table with the specified columns. The `LinePlot.create` method is used to create a new LinePlot with the specified title, table, and axes.

The code is written in Java, and it uses the Tablesaw library, which is a Java library for data manipulation and analysis.
