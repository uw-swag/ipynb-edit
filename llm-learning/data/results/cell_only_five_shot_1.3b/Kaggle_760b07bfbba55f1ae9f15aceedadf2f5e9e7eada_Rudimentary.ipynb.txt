```
    # Import necessary libraries
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import sqlite3

    # Connect to the SQLite database
    conn = sqlite3.connect('/Users/sominwadhwa/database.sqlite')

    # Query the database
    cur = conn.cursor()

    # Read the data from the database
    countries = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT id,name from Country",conn)
    matches = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * from Match", conn)
    leagues = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * from League",conn)
    teams = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * from Team",conn)

    # Filter the countries based on major leagues
    major_league_countries = ['England','France','Germany','Italy','Spain']
    countries = countries[countries.name.isin(major_league_countries)]

    # Display the filtered countries
    print(countries)

    # Close the connection to the database
    conn.close()
    ```

    This code will filter the countries based on the major leagues and display the filtered countries.
