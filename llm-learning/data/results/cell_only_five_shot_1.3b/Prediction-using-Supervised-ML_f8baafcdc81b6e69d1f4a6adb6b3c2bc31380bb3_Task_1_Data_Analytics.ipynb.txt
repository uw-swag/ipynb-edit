    ### Response:
    It seems like you're trying to add files via upload. However, you haven't provided any code or context. 

    If you're using a Jupyter notebook, you can use the `upload` function from the `ipywidgets` module to upload files. Here's a simple example:

    ```python
    from IPython.display import FileUpload

    upload = FileUpload()
    upload
    ```

    This will display a file upload widget. You can then select a file and upload it.

    If you're using a different platform or a different language, the process may be different. Please provide more details if you need a more specific solution.
