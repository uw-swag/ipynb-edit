    The code you provided is a Python script that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to summarize a text. The script first tokenizes the text into sentences, then it uses the Gensim library to find the most common phrases in the text. The script then uses the NLTK library to find the most common words in the text. The script also uses the BeautifulSoup library to extract the title and text from a webpage.

    The script has several functions, including:

    - `summarize`: This function takes a text and a limit as input, and returns the top `limit` sentences from the text that are most similar to the title.

    - `get_summary`: This function is similar to `summarize`, but it also takes into account the most common words in the text.

    - `split_sentences`: This function splits the text into sentences and tokenizes each sentence.

    - `score_sentences`: This function scores the sentences based on the frequency of the most common words in the sentences.
