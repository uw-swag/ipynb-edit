The code you provided is a demonstration of how to use the `evidently` library to create a report with custom descriptors. The `evidently` library is a Python library for creating comprehensive and automated machine learning (ML) reports.

The code first creates a report with the `TextOverviewPreset` metric, which provides a summary of the text data. The `TextOverviewPreset` metric also accepts a list of descriptors, which are used to measure the quality of the text data.

The code then creates a report with the `TextOverviewPreset` metric, but this time it only measures the "Review_Text" and "Title" columns. The `TextOverviewPreset` metric also accepts a list of descriptors, which are used to measure the quality of the text data.

The code then creates a report with the `TextOverviewPreset` metric, but this time it measures the "Review_Text" and "Title" columns with custom descriptors.

The code then creates a report with the `ColumnSummaryMetric` metric, which provides a summary of the semantic similarity between the "Review_Text" and "Title" columns.

The code also creates a report with the `ColumnSummaryMetric` metric, but this time it only measures the "Review_Text" and "Title" columns.

The code finally creates a report with the `ColumnSummaryMetric` metric, but this time it measures the "Review_Text" and "Title" columns with custom descriptors.

The code demonstrates how to use the `evidently` library to create a report with custom descriptors.
