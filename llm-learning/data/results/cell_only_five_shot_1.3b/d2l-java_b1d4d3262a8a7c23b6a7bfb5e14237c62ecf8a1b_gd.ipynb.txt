The function `train2d()` is used to train a 2D objective function. The function `showTrace2d()` is used to show the trace of 2D variables during optimization.

The `train2d()` function takes a `Function<Float[], Float[]>` as an argument, which is a custom trainer for a 2D objective function. The function `showTrace2d()` takes a `BiFunction<Float, Float, Float>` and an `ArrayList<Weights>` as arguments, which are the 2D variables and their history during optimization.

The `Weights` class is used to store the state of the 2D variables. The `train2d()` function initializes the 2D variables `x1` and `x2` with a default value, and then iterates `steps` times, updating the 2D variables and adding them to the `results` list.

The `showTrace2d()` function is a placeholder for the function that will be used to show the trace of 2D variables. This function is not implemented in the provided code, but it is expected to be implemented in a future version of the code.

The `trainer` function in the `train2d()` function is a placeholder for the custom trainer function. This function is not implemented in the provided code, but it is expected to be implemented in a future version of the code.

The `f` function in the `showTrace2d()` function is a placeholder for the function that will be used to plot the 2D variables. This function is not implemented in the provided code, but it is expected to be implemented in a future version of the code.

The `res` array in the `showTrace2d()` function is a placeholder for the result of the optimization. This array is not implemented in the provided code, but it is expected to be implemented in a future version of the code.

The `manager` variable is a placeholder for the NDArray manager. This variable is not implemented in the provided code, but it is expected to be implemented in a future version of the code.

The `fLineND` variable is a placeholder for the NDArray of x values. This variable is not implemented in the provided code, but it is expected to be implemented in a future version of the code
