    The code provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook. It includes a series of code cells, each of which is designed to solve a specific problem or demonstrate a specific concept. The cells are grouped into several categories:

    1. Data Preparation: This category includes code to download and prepare the housing dataset, and to split the dataset into a training set and a test set.

    2. Feature Engineering: This category includes code to create new features that might be useful for predicting the median house value.

    3. Model Training: This category includes code to train a linear regression model, a random forest regressor, and a supervised learning model.

    4. Model Evaluation: This category includes code to evaluate the performance of the models.

    5. Exercise Solution: This category includes code to solve a specific exercise or problem.

    The last cell of each code cell is a comment that explains what the code does.

    Please note that the code provided is a general template and may need to be adapted to your specific needs.
