    ### Introduction

    Docs restructuring is a process that involves reorganizing and restructuring the content of a documentation to improve its clarity, usability, and maintainability. It's a crucial step in the documentation process, as it aids in making the documentation more user-friendly, efficient, and understandable.

    ### Why Docs Restructuring?

    Docs restructuring is beneficial in several ways:

    1. **Improved User Experience**: By restructuring the documentation, it becomes easier for users to find the information they need.

    2. **Efficiency**: It reduces the amount of time spent on documentation, as it allows for quick access to the information.

    3. **Maintainability**: It makes the documentation easier to update and maintain, as it's more organized and focused on the information needed.

    ### How to Restructure Docs

    Restructuring the documentation can be done in several ways:

    1. **By Adding or Removing Sections**: You can add or remove sections to make the documentation more organized.

    2. **By Changing the Order of Sections**: You can rearrange the sections to make the information more logical.

    3. **By Adding or Removing Subsections**: You can add or remove subsections to make the information more detailed.

    ### Best Practices

    When restructuring the documentation, follow these best practices:

    1. **Consistency**: Ensure that the restructuring is consistent across all sections.

    2. **Clear Separation**: Separate the information into logical sections.

    3. **Use of Headings**: Use headings (e.g., h1, h2, h3) to structure the information
