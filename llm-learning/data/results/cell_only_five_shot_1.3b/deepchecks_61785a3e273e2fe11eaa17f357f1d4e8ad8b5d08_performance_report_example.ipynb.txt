```python
    # Modifying check without function
    check = 10
    if check > 5:
        print("Check is greater than 5")
    else:
        print("Check is not greater than 5")
    ```

    ### Explanation:
    The code is checking if a variable `check` is greater than 5. If it is, it prints "Check is greater than 5". If not, it prints "Check is not greater than 5".

    ### Modification:
    The code was modified to use a function. The function `is_greater_than_five` is created to check if a variable is greater than 5. The if-else statement is replaced with a call to the function.

    ### Modified Code:
    ```python
    def is_greater_than_five(check_value):
        if check_value > 5:
            return True
        else:
            return False

    check = 10
    if is_greater_than_five(check):
        print("Check is greater than 5")
    else:
        print("Check is not greater than 5")
    ```
