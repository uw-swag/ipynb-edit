    ## Definition
    A capsule network is a type of artificial neural network that is used to solve complex problems. It is a combination of two or more layers of artificial neural networks, known as capsules. The primary advantage of capsule networks is that they can learn complex representations of data, which is not possible with traditional neural networks.

    ## Types of Capsule Networks

    ### 1. Capsule Networks with Capsule Layers
    A capsule network with a single layer of capsules is known as a Capsule Net. In this network, the input is a vector of data points, and the output is a vector of the same length. The capsules in this network are used to learn complex representations of the data.

    ### 2. Capsule Networks with Capsule-Capsule Layers
    A capsule network with two layers of capsules is known as a Capsule-Capsule Net. In this network, the input is a vector of data points, and the output is a vector of the same length. The capsules in this network are used to learn complex representations of the data.

    ### 3. Capsule Networks with Masked Capsule Layers
    A capsule network with a masked layer of capsules is known as a Masked Capsule Net. In this network, the input is a vector of data points, and the output is a vector of the same length. The capsules in this network are used to learn complex representations of the data.

    ## Applications

    ### 1. Recommendation Systems
    Capsule networks can be used in recommendation systems to recommend items to users based on their past behavior.

    ### 2. Medical Image Analysis
    Capsule networks can be used in medical image analysis to detect abnormalities in medical images.

    ### 3. Natural Language Processing
    Capsule networks can be used in natural language processing to understand the context of words in a sentence.

    ## Challenges

    ### 1. Training
    Training a capsule network is a challenging task due to the high dimensionality of the problem space.

    ### 2. Complexity
