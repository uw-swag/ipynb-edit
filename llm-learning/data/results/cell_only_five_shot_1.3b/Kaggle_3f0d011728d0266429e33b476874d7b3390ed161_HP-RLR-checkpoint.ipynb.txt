The code you provided is incomplete and does not contain the complete process of connecting the machine learning models and cleaning the data. 

The code you provided is for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training. However, it is not clear what the complete process of connecting the machine learning models and cleaning the data is.

If you want to connect the machine learning models, you would need to define the models and their parameters, and then fit the models to the training data. If you want to clean the data, you would need to define the cleaning process and how it is applied to the training and test data.

Please provide more details about the complete process of connecting the machine learning models and cleaning the data.
