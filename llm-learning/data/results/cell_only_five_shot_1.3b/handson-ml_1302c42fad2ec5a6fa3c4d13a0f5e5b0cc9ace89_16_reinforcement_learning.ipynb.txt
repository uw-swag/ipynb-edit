    ### Response:
    The code you've provided is not valid and won't render. It's just a placeholder for the next code cell. If you're trying to render something in a Jupyter notebook, you should use the `%%html` magic command to render HTML. For example:

    ```python
    %%html
    <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    </div>
    ```

    This will render the HTML `<div><h1>Hello, world!</h1></div>` in the notebook.

    If you're trying to render something in a Python script, you should use the `%%script` magic command to render Python code. For example:

    ```python
    %%script
    print("Hello, world!")
    ```

    This will render the Python code `print("Hello, world!")` in the notebook.

    If you're trying to render something in a Python script, you should use the `%%script` magic command to render Python code. For example:

    ```python
    %%script
    print("Hello, world!")
    ```

    This will render the Python code `print("Hello, world!")` in the notebook.
