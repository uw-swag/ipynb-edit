    ## Notes on Z

    Z is the third index in the miller indices. It is used to define the plane of the interfacial interface. The plane is defined by the miller indices. The plane is defined by the sign of the product of the miller indices.

    For example, if the miller indices are (1, 1, 1), the plane is defined by the sign of the product of the miller indices. The sign of the product is +1, which means the plane is above the origin.

    The plane is also defined by the sign of the sum of the miller indices. The sign of the sum is the same as the sign of the product of the miller indices.

    The plane is also defined by the sign of the difference of the miller indices. The sign of the difference is the opposite of the sign of the product of the miller indices.

    The plane is also defined by the sign of the difference of the sum of the miller indices. The sign of the difference is the same as the sign of the product of the sum of the miller indices.

    The plane is also defined by the sign of the difference of the difference of the sum of the miller indices. The sign of the difference is the same as the sign of the product of the difference of the sum of the miller indices.

    The plane is also defined by the sign of the product of the difference of the difference of the sum of the miller indices. The sign of the product is the same as the sign of the product of the difference of the difference of the sum of the miller indices.

    The plane is also defined by the sign of the product of the difference of the difference of the difference of the sum of the miller indices. The sign of the product is the same as the sign of the product of the difference of the difference of the difference of the sum of the miller indices.

    The plane is also defined by the sign of the product of the difference of the difference of the difference of the difference of the sum of the miller indices. The sign of the product is the same as the sign of the product of the difference of the difference of the difference of the difference of the sum of the miller indices.
