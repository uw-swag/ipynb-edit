    ### Code Changes:
    # The code in the original cells is not provided, but I'll make some assumptions based on the context.
    # Let's say the bug is in the dataset creation. The code is supposed to create a DataFrame with columns 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'.
    # The bug is that the DataFrame is not being created correctly.

    # Here's a simple example of how the code might be fixed:

    # Assuming df is the DataFrame that's supposed to be created
    df = pd.DataFrame(columns=['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'])

    # Now, let's say we have a list of tuples, where each tuple is a row in the DataFrame
    data = [('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'), ('f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j'), ('k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o')]

    # We can use a list comprehension to add each row to the DataFrame
    df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'])

    # Now, the DataFrame should be created correctly

    # Now, let's say we want to rerun the notebooks. This will depend on the specifics of your notebooks,
    # but in general, you'd want to clear the outputs of the cells that you're rerunning,
    # and then rerun the notebook.

    # For example, if you're using Jupyter notebook, you can clear the outputs by clicking on the cell and pressing 'Esc' or 'Ctrl+Shift+Esc'
    # Then, you can rerun the notebook by clicking on the cell and pressing 'Enter' or 'Shift+Enter'

    # If you're using a different tool, the process for clearing the outputs will be different

    # Please provide the original code cells if you need a more specific solution.
