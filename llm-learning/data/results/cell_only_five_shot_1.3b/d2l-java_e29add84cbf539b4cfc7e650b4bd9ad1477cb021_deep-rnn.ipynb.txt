    Here is the reduced version of your code. I have reduced the number of lines and removed unnecessary variables.

```python
num_epochs = 500
lr = 2
TimeMachine.trainCh8(model, dataset, vocab, lr, num_epochs, device, False, manager)
```

This version of the code is more concise and easier to read. However, please note that the performance of the code may still be affected by the size of the `model`, `dataset`, `vocab`, `device`, and `manager` variables.
