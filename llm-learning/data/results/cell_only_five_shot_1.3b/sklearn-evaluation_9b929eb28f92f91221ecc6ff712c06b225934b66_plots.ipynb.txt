    The notebook you've provided is a comprehensive guide to using the scikit-learn library in Python for machine learning. It covers a wide range of topics, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, and it also includes examples of using the OneVsRestClassifier and ExtraTreesClassifier classes.

    However, the notebook is not clear enough to provide a new API. The current API of scikit-learn is quite simple and straightforward, and it's designed to be easy to use and understand. It provides a wide range of functions and classes, but it's not designed to provide a new API.

    If you want to create a new API for scikit-learn, you would need to design a new interface that allows users to interact with the library in a more user-friendly way. This would involve creating new functions and classes, and possibly even creating new modules.

    If you're interested in creating a new API, I recommend starting with the scikit-learn documentation and the source code of the scikit-learn library. There are many examples of how to create a new API in the source code of the library.

    Here's a simple example of how you might create a new API for a function:

    ```python
    def my_function(X, y):
        # Your function code here
        pass

    def my_function_with_params(param1, param2):
        # Your function code here
        pass
    ```

    You can then expose these functions and classes to users of the library.
