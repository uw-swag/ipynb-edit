            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

    # Usage
    auto_play_audio("path_to_your_audio_file.mp3")
    ```

    This function uses the IPython.display module to play the audio file. The audio file is played in the notebook.

    Please replace "path_to_your_audio_file.mp3" with the actual path to your audio file.
