    # Get the bucket object

    ### Response:
    Here is a simple example of how you might add a new feature to a Python class.

    ```python
    class MyClass:
        def __init__(self):
            self.my_attribute = "Initial value"

        def new_feature(self):
            # This is a new feature
            self.my_attribute = "New value"

        def get_attribute(self):
            return self.my_attribute
    ```

    You can use the `new_feature` method to change the value of `my_attribute`, and then use the `get_attribute` method to retrieve the new value.

    Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world applications would likely require more complex code.
