The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses matplotlib and PIL (Python Imaging Library) to display and manipulate images. The notebook is divided into two parts, each of which includes a series of subplots. The first part is for the city road image, and the second part is for the Italy street image. 

In the first part, there are six subplots, each displaying a different iteration of the style transfer process. The subplots are arranged in a 6x2 grid, with the first row containing the original image, the second row containing the first iteration, the third row containing the fifth iteration, and so on. 

The second part of the notebook is similar, but for the second image, which is a tiger image. 

The notebook also includes a suptitle, which is a title that appears at the top of the figure. 

The code is written in Python and uses the matplotlib library for plotting.
