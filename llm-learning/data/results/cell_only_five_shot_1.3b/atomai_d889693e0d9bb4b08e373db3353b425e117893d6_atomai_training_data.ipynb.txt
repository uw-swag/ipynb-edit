```python
    # Import necessary libraries
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

    # Load the training data
    data = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_training_data.csv')

    # Split the data into features and target variable
    X = data.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
    y = data['target_variable']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Print the shape of the training data
    print(X_train.shape)

    # Print the shape of the testing data
    print(X_test.shape)

    # Print the shape of the target variable
    print(y_train.shape)

    # Print the shape of the target variable
    print(y_test.shape)
    ```
    This notebook will prepare the training data for a machine learning model by loading the data, splitting it into features and target variable, and then splitting the data into training and testing sets. The shapes of the training and testing data will be printed to the console.
