    # PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library in Python. It is developed by Facebook's AI Research lab and is used for developing neural networks.

    # PyTorch is built on the following key components:

    # 1. TorchScript: A high-performance, high-level scripting language for PyTorch.
    # 2. TorchVision: A collection of machine learning and deep learning libraries for computer vision.
    # 3. TorchAudio: A collection of libraries for audio processing.
    # 4. TorchStats: A collection of statistical functions for PyTorch.

    # PyTorch is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, and it provides a wide range of functionalities for deep learning.

    # Here is a simple example of a PyTorch program:

    ```python
    import torch

    # Create a tensor
    x = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

    # Create a tensor with zeros
    y = torch.zeros(3)

    # Create a tensor with ones
    z = torch.ones(2)

    # Create a tensor with random values
    r = torch.rand(2)

    # Create a tensor with random values in a specific range
    t = torch.randn(2, 2)

    # Create a tensor with a specific data type
    u = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], dtype=torch.float32)

    # Create a tensor with a specific size
    v = torch.empty(2, 2)

    # Create a tensor with a specific size and type
    w = torch.empty(2, 2, dtype=torch.float32)

    # Create a tensor with a specific size and type, and initialize it with a specific value
    x = torch.empty(2, 2, dtype=torch.float32).fill_(1)

    # Create a tensor with a specific size and type, and initialize it with a specific value
    y = torch.empty(2, 2, d
