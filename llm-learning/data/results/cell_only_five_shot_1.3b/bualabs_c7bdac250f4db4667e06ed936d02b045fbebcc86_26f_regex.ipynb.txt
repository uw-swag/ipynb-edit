    print(df.isnull().sum())

    # Checking the statistical details of the dataset
    print(df.describe())

    # Checking the distribution of the target variable
    print(df['target'].value_counts())

    # Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df.drop('target', axis=1), df['target'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Feature scaling
    sc = StandardScaler()
    X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = sc.transform(X_test)

    # Training the model
    model = LogisticRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Making predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluating the model
    print('Accuracy:', accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
    print('Confusion Matrix:', confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))

    # Visualizing the confusion matrix
    sns.heatmap(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred), annot=True, fmt='d')

    ```
    This code is a simple example of how to use logistic regression for a binary classification problem. The dataset is loaded from a CSV file, and then the model is trained and evaluated
