    The code is used for data exploration and analysis. It uses linear regression to find the relationship between different features and the target variable 'user'. The relationship is then plotted using matplotlib.

    The code is divided into three parts:

    1. The function `show_relationship` is used to plot the relationship between a specific feature and the target variable.

    2. The function `fit_and_predict` is used to fit a linear regression model to the data and make predictions.

    3. The function `evaluate` is used to evaluate the performance of the model.

    The code also includes a call to `evaluate`, which is not shown in the original code.

    Please note that the code assumes that the data is in a pandas DataFrame named 'df' and that the target variable is named 'user'. The function `get_full_data` is not defined in the original code, but it is assumed to be a function that fetches the full data.

    The code also assumes that the features to be used for the relationship analysis are 'blink_left', 'blink_right', 'smile_or_not', 'rate_smile_or_not', 'rate_blink_left', and 'rate_blink_right'.

    The code also assumes that the target variable is a categorical variable named 'user'.

    The code also assumes that the function `evaluate` is defined in a module named 'predicting_who_is'.

    The code also assumes that the function `fit_and_predict` is defined in a module named 'predicting_who_is'.

    The code also assumes that the function `get_full_data` is defined in a module named 'data'.

    The code also assumes that the function `evaluate` is defined in a module named 'predicting_who_is'.
