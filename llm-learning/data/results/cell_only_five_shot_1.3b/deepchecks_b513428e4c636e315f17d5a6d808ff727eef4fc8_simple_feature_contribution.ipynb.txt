    # Let's start with a simple feature contribution issue 842 (#989)

    # First, we need to import the necessary libraries
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
    from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

    # Let's assume we have a DataFrame df with a column 'description'
    df = pd.DataFrame({
        'description': [
            'This is a great product',
            'This product is not bad',
            'The quality of this product is mediocre',
            'I love this product',
            'I hate this product'
        ]
    })

    # We can use the TfidfVectorizer to convert the text into a matrix of TF-IDF features
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
    X = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['description'])

    # We can then calculate the cosine similarity between all pairs of descriptions
    cosine_sim = cosine_similarity(X, X)

    # Now, let's say we want to find the most similar product to 'This is a great product'
    # We can do this by finding the index of 'This is a great product' in the DataFrame and then finding the index of the most similar product
    most_similar_index = df['description'].values.tolist().index('This is a great product')
    most_similar_product = df.iloc[most_similar_index].values[0]

    # We can then print the most similar product
    print(most_similar_product)
