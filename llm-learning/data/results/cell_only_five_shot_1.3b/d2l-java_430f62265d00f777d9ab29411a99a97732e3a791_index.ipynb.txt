    This script fetches all repositories from a source organization, clones each repository to a destination organization, and then changes the remote URL of the cloned repository to point to the destination repository. It then pushes the cloned repository to the destination organization.

    Please replace 'source-org' and 'deepjava-library' with your actual source and destination organizations.

    Also, this script assumes that you have the necessary permissions to clone and push repositories to the destination organization.

    Please note that this script is a simple example and may not work for all repositories. It may not work if the repositories are private or if the source organization has disabled push access.

    Also, this script does not handle any potential issues that may arise when cloning or pushing repositories, such as network
