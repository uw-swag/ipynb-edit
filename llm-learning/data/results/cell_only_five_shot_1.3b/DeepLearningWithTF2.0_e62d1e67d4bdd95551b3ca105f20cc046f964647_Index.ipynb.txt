    ### Response:
    Here is an example of how you can update the index logo in your code. 

    In this example, I'm assuming you're using a web framework like Flask or Django.

    If you're using Flask, you can update the index logo like this:

    ```python
    from flask import Flask, render_template

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def home():
        return render_template('index.html')

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True)
    ```

    In the `index.html` file, you can update the logo like this:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Home</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='logo.png') }}" alt="Logo">
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

    This will display the logo located in the `static` directory of your Flask application.

    If you're using a different web framework, the process will be similar, but the specifics of how to update the logo will depend on the framework you're using.

    Please replace `'logo.png'` with the actual path to your logo file.

    If you're not using a web framework, the process will be different, but the specifics will depend on the programming language you're using.
