    # 3. The volatility of the stock price
    # 4. The time to maturity
    # 5. The risk-free rate
    # 6. The dividend yield
    # 7. The market's liquidity
    # 8. The market's size
    # 9. The market's liquidity
    # 10. The market's capital
    # 11. The market's turnover
    # 12. The market's interest rate
