    The provided code is a Jupyter notebook that uses PyMongo to connect to a MongoDB database, retrieves data from a "yelp" database, and then uses pandas to process and manipulate the data. It also uses psycopg2 to connect to a PostgreSQL database and store the data from the MongoDB database into a new table in the PostgreSQL database.

    The notebook is divided into several sections:

    1. The `access_collections` function retrieves collections from the "yelp" database using PyMongo.

    2. The `batched` function is a generator that yields batches of documents from a cursor.

    3. The main part of the notebook retrieves data from the "yelp" database, processes it, and stores it in a pandas DataFrame.

    4. The DataFrame is then filtered and normalized to keep only the necessary columns.

    5. The DataFrame is then stored in a PostgreSQL database using psycopg2.

    The notebook also includes a presentation video, which is not included in the provided code.

    Please note that the code is written in a Jupyter notebook format and requires the PyMongo, pandas, psycopg2, and sqlalchemy libraries to be installed.
