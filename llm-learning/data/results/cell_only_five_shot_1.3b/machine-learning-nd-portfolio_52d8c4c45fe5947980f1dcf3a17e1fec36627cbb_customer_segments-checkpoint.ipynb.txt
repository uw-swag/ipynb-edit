    The folder structure is now updated to follow the best practices for data science projects. This includes separating raw data (`/data/raw`) and processed data (`/data/processed`), notebooks for code and results (`/notebooks`), reports (`/reports`), scripts for data preprocessing and analysis (`/scripts`), models (`/models`), and assets (`/assets`).
