    The error message you're seeing is due to the fact that the `Pipeline` expects a list of tuples, not a tuple of tuples. The error is caused by the fact that you're trying to pass a tuple of tuples to the `Pipeline` constructor, which is not allowed in scikit-learn.

    The correct way to create a pipeline with multiple steps is to use a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the name of the step and the parameters to be passed to it. Here's how you can modify your code:

    ```python
    from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

    svm_clf = Pipeline([
        ("scaler", StandardScaler()),
        ("linear_svc", LinearSVC(C=1, loss="hinge", random_state=42)),
    ])
    ```

    In this case, the `Pipeline` will automatically create a list of tuples for you, and the `fit` method will automatically handle the creation of the list of tuples.

    If you want to pass parameters to each step, you can do so by using the `Pipeline` constructor with a list of tuples, and then passing the parameters to each step in the list of tuples. Here's an example:

    ```python
    svm_clf = Pipeline([
        ("scaler", StandardScaler()),
        ("linear_svc", LinearSVC(C=1, loss="hinge", random_state=42, C=100)),
    ])
    ```

    In this case, the `C` parameter will be passed to the `LinearSVC` step.
