```python
    # Update the version of the package
    __version__ = '0.0.1'
    ```

    The above code is a minor version update for the package. The `__version__` variable is used to store the current version of the package. The version number is updated in the `__init__.py` file.

    Please note that this is a minor version update. If you're using a version control system like Git, you would typically use a command like `git commit -m "Minor version update"` to commit your changes.

    Also, remember to update the `pyproject.toml` file to reflect the new version number. This file is used by setuptools to determine the project's version.

    Here's the `pyproject.toml` file:

    ```toml
    [build-system]
    requires = ["setuptools", "wheel"]

    [tool.poetry]
    name = "your-package-name"
    version = "0.0.1"

    [tool.poetry.dependencies]
    python = "^3.7"
    # Add any other dependencies your package has here
    ```

    Replace "your-package-name" with the name of your package.
