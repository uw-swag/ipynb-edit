    The code you provided is a Python script that merges two dataframes (`comments_df` and `users_df`) based on a common column ('from_id'). The merged dataframe is then saved to a CSV file.

    Here's a breakdown of the code:

    - `comments_df.merge(users_df[['id', 'is_gum']], left_on='from_id', right_on='id', how='inner')`: This line merges `comments_df` and `users_df` based on the 'from_id' column. The 'id' column from `users_df` is used as the common column. The 'inner' join is used to keep only the rows where there is a match in both dataframes.

    - `comments_merged[['from_id', 'text', 'is_gum']].to_csv('data/comments.csv.gz', index=False, compression='gzip')`: This line selects the columns 'from_id', 'text', and 'is_gum' from the merged dataframe and saves it to a CSV file. The 'index=False' argument is used to prevent pandas from writing row indices into the CSV file. The 'compression='gzip'' argument is used to compress the CSV file.

    The final code is a combination of data manipulation and file I/O operations. It's a good example of how to use pandas to perform complex data manipulations and how to use Python's file I/O operations to write data to a file.
