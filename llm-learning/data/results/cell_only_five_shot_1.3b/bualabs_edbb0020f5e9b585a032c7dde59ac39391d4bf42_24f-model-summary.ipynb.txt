    ## 24f Model Summary

    The 24f model is a deep learning model that is trained to predict the next word in a sequence of words. It is a sequence-to-sequence model, which means it takes a sequence of words as input and predicts the next word in the sequence.

    The model is trained on a large corpus of text data, which includes a mix of English and French sentences. The model is trained to understand the context of the sentences and predict the next word in the sequence.

    The model is trained using a recurrent neural network (RNN) with an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) cell. The LSTM cell is a type of recurrent neural network that is capable of learning from the sequence of words.

    The model is trained for 100 epochs, with a batch size of 128. The learning rate is set to 0.01, and the optimizer is Adam.

    The model's performance is evaluated using the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score, which is a metric used to evaluate the quality of a translation or machine translation. The BLEU score is computed for each sentence in the test set, and the model's performance is reported as the mean BLEU score.

    The model's architecture is as follows:

    - Input layer: An embedding layer that converts the input words into dense vectors of fixed size.
    - LSTM layer: A Long Short-Term Memory layer that processes the input sequence.
    - Dense layer: A fully connected layer that outputs the predicted word.

    The model's performance is reported as the mean BLEU score on the test set.

    The model's architecture and training process are described in detail in the paper "A Neural Network for Machine Translation: Encoder-Decoder Models with Attention" by Ilya Sutskever, Oriol Vinyals, and Quoc V. Le.
