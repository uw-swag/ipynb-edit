    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook. The notebook is using the Deep Java Library (DJL) to train a neural network. The DJL version is 0.13.0.

    The code includes two methods: `evaluateAccuracy` and `predictCh3`.

    1. `evaluateAccuracy`: This method evaluates the accuracy of a neural network on a dataset. It takes a neural network and an iterable of batches as input, and returns the accuracy of the network on the dataset.

    2. `predictCh3`: This method takes a neural network, a dataset, a number of predictions to make, and a NDManager as input. It uses the neural network to make predictions on the dataset, and then displays the predictions.

    The `predictCh3` method is commented out, so you can uncomment it to make predictions.

    The code is written in Java, and it uses the Deep Java Library (DJL) to train a neural network. The DJL version is 0.13.0.
