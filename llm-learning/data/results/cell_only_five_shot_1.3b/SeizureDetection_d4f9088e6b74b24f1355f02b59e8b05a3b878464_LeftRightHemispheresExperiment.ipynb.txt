```python
    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np

    # Fetch the dataset
    data = fetch_openml('mnist_784', version=1)

    # Convert the data to a pandas DataFrame
    df = pd.DataFrame(data.data)
    df['target'] = data.target

    # Normalize the features
    df = featureNormalization(df)

    # Reduce the dimensionality of the features
    df = dimentionalityReduction(df)

    # Balance the dataset
    df = datasetBalancing(df)

    # Split the dataset into training and test sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = createTrainingAndTestDatasets(df)

    # Compute the classification performance indexes
    classificationPerformanceIndexes(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test)
    ```

    The above code is a sample of how to download and preprocess the MNIST dataset. The dataset is fetched from the sklearn library, and then it is converted to a pandas DataFrame for further processing. The features are normalized, reduced dimensionality, and balanced. Finally, the dataset is split into training and test sets. The classification performance indexes are computed.
