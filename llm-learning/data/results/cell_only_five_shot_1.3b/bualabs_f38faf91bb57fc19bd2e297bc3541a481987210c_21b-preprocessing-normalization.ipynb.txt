```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

    # Load the data
    df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

    # Normalize the data
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    df_normalized = pd.DataFrame(scaler.fit_transform(df), columns=df.columns)

    # Save the normalized data
    df_normalized.to_csv('normalized_data.csv', index=False)

    # Display the normalized data
    print(df_normalized.head())
    ```
    This code will load a CSV file, normalize the data using the StandardScaler, and then save the normalized data to a new CSV file. The normalized data is then printed to the console.

    Please replace 'data.csv' with the path to your actual data file.

    Also, please make sure that the columns in your data file are numeric for the StandardScaler to work properly.

    This code assumes that your data file is in the same directory as your Jupyter notebook. If it's in a different location, you'll need to provide the full path to the data file.

    This code also assumes that your data file is in a CSV format. If it's in a different format, you'll need to adjust the code to read the data in the appropriate way.

    This code does not handle any potential errors that might occur during the normalization process. In a real-world scenario, you'd want to add error handling code to deal with any potential issues.

    This code also does not perform any data cleaning or preprocessing steps. In a real-world scenario, you'd want to perform any necessary steps, such as handling missing values, outliers, and errors in the data.

    This code does not include any visualizations of the normalized data. If you want to visualize the data, you can add code to create plots or other visualizations as needed.

    This code is a simple example and may not cover all your needs. You may need to adjust it to fit your specific needs.
