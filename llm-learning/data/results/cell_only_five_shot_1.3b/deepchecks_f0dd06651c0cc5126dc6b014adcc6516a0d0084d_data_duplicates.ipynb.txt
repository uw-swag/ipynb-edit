    df = pd.DataFrame({

    This code will split the DataFrame into multiple files based on the DataDuplicates check. The files will be named after the check and the column they are checking.

    Please note that this is a simplified example and may not work as expected in your specific use case. The DataDuplicates check in DeepChecks is designed to find duplicates in a DataFrame, but it does not provide a way to split the DataFrame into multiple files based on the duplic
