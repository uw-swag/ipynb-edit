    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook. It's a function that takes an image path as input, and returns the top 10 most likely recipes based on the image. The function uses a pre-trained model to predict the probabilities of the top 10 most likely recipes, and then it displays the top 10 most likely recipes along with their probabilities.

    The function `model_predict` is called with an image path as an argument. The image is preprocessed and passed to the feature extractor, which is used to extract features from the image. The features are then used to query the nearest neighbors in the index. The indices of the nearest neighbors are retrieved, and the corresponding labels and probabilities are retrieved.

    The function `show_result_images` is called with the final result, which is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a recipe id and a probability. The function displays the top 10 most likely recipes along with their probabilities.

    The function `get_corresponding_recipes` is called with the final result, which is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a recipe id and a probability. The function returns a list of tuples where each tuple contains a recipe id and a confidence score.
