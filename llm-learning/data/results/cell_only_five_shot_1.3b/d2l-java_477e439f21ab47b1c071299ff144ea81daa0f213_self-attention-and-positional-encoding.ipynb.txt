    The code you provided is written in Java and uses the Deep Learning library, DL4J, for creating and training a model. The code is upgrading the DL4J version to 0.13.0. 

    The code is creating a PositionalEncoding class, which is a part of a transformer model. The PositionalEncoding class is used to create a positional encoding matrix, which is a type of positional information that is added to the input embeddings to make the model more capable of understanding the order of the sequence.

    The code then creates a PositionalEncoding object, and uses it to create a positional encoding matrix. The positional encoding matrix is then used to create a transformer model, which is a type of model that uses positional information to make it more capable of understanding the order of the sequence.

    Finally, the code plots the positional encoding matrix.
