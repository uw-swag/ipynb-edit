    ## Data Drift Check Documentation

    ## Overview
    Data drift is a critical aspect of data analysis. It refers to the tendency of data to change over time, from one period to another. This can be due to various reasons such as new data being collected, old data being outdated, or the data being collected in a different way.

    ## Steps to Check Data Drift

    1. **Data Collection**: Collect the data from the source where the data is collected.

    2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the data to clean it and handle any missing or inconsistent data.

    3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that might help in detecting data drift.

    4. **Model Training**: Train a model on the preprocessed data.

    5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on the preprocessed data.

    6. **Drift Detection**: If the model's performance on the preprocessed data is not satisfactory, it indicates that data drift is present.

    ## Important Points to Remember

    - Data drift can be caused by a variety of reasons, such as new data being collected, old data being outdated, or the data being collected in a different way.

    - Data drift can be a significant issue in many fields, including healthcare, finance, and many others.

    - Detecting data drift is a challenging task, as it requires a good understanding of the data and the model's performance.

    - There are several methods to detect data drift, such as statistical methods, machine learning methods, and deep learning methods.

    - It's important to continuously monitor and evaluate the data drift to ensure that the model is not overfitting the data.

    - The goal of data drift detection is to help identify the source of the data drift and to make necessary adjustments to the model to prevent it from becoming a problem in the future.
