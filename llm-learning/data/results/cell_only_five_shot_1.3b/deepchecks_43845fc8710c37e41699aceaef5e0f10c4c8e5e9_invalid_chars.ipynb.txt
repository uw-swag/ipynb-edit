    ### Response:
To add a button to a Jupyter notebook, you can use the `ipywidgets` library. Here's an example of how you can add an "Approve" button:

```python
import ipywidgets as widgets

def on_button_clicked(b):
    print("Approved!")

btn = widgets.Button(description="Approve")
btn.on_click(on_button_clicked)
display(btn)
```

In this example, when the button is clicked, it will print "Approved!" to the console. You can replace the `print("Approved!")` with any code you want to run when the button is clicked.

Please note that you need to run this code in a Jupyter notebook cell. If you're running this code in a different environment, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.
