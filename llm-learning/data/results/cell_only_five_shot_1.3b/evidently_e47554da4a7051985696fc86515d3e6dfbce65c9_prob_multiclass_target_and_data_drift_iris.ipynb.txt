    ## Chapter 01: Introduction
    
    ### 01.1: Introduction
    In this chapter, we will introduce the reader to the basics of data science, machine learning, and the use of Python libraries like pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. We will also cover the basics of data visualization using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn.

    ### 01.2: What is Data Science?
    Data science is a process of extracting knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It involves the use of various data analysis techniques and statistical methods to extract knowledge from data.

    ### 01.3: What is Machine Learning?
    Machine learning is a subset of data science that involves the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make decisions or predictions based on data.

    ### 01.4: Python Libraries
    We will be using Python libraries like pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn for data analysis and machine learning tasks.

    ## Chapter 02: Basics of Data Analysis

    ### 02.1: Importing Libraries
    We will start with importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset.

    ### 02.2: Understanding the Dataset
    We will explore the dataset and understand its structure, data types, and the distribution of data.

    ### 02.3: Data Cleaning
    We will clean the data and handle missing values, outliers, and errors.

    ### 02.4: Data Visualization
    We will use data visualization techniques to understand the data better.

    ## Chapter 03: Basics of Machine Learning

    ### 03.1: Understanding Machine Learning
    We will explain the basics of machine learning and its types, such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.

    ### 03.2: Supervised Learning
    We will discuss supervised learning algorithms, such as linear regression, logistic regression, and decision trees.

    ### 03.3: Unsupervised Learning
    We will discuss unsupervised learning algorithms, such as K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering
