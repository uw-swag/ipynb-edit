```python
    import nbformat as nbf
    from nbconvert.preprocessors import ExecutePreprocessor

    # Load the notebook
    nb = nbf.read('notebook.ipynb', as_version=4)

    # Execute the notebook
    ep = ExecutePreprocessor(timeout=-1, kernel_name='python3')
    nbf.write(nb, 'notebook.ipynb')

    # Add a new cell at the end
    nb['cells'].append({
        'cell_type': 'code',
        'metadata': {},
        'source': [
            'nblinks.add_link("link_text", "url")'
        ],
        'outputs': []
    })

    # Write the notebook back to disk
    nbf.write(nb, 'notebook.ipynb')
    ```
    This code will add a new cell at the end of the notebook that includes a call to the `nblinks.add_link` function. The new cell will add a link to the notebook.

    Please note that you need to have the `nblinks` package installed in your Python environment. If it's not installed, you can install it using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install nblinks
    ```

    Also, this code assumes that the notebook is in the same directory as the script. If it's in a different location, you'll need to specify the full path to the notebook file.
