    The provided code is an implementation of the simple averaging ensembles for a machine learning model. The ensembles are created by taking the average of the predictions of different models. The models are EfficientNetV2 for medium, large, and small configurations, and B4, B5, and B6 for different test sets. The ensembles are then calculated by taking the average of the predictions of the individual models. The accuracy and mean squared error of the ensembles are then printed.

    The code is divided into several sections, each of which is responsible for a different model or ensemble. The ensembles are calculated by taking the average of the predictions of the individual models. The accuracy and mean squared error of the ensembles are then printed.

    The code is designed to be modular and reusable, so it can be easily extended to include more models or ensembles.

    The code is also designed to be scalable, as it can be easily modified to include more models or ensembles.

    The code is also designed to be efficient, as it only requires a single pass over the data, making it suitable for large datasets.

    The code is also designed to be user-friendly, as it provides clear instructions and examples of how to use the code.

    The code is also designed to be robust, as it includes error checking and handling for potential issues, such as missing or incorrect data.

    The code is also designed to be maintainable, as it is well-documented and easy to understand.

    The code is also designed to be flexible, as it can be easily modified to include more features or optimizations.
