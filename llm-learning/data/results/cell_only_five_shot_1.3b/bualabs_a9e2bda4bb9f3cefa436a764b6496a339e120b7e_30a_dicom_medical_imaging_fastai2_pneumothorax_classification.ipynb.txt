    The code you provided is a PyTorch implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for text classification. The `weight` variable is used to assign weights to the loss function. In the code, the weights are set to be 0.2 for the first class and 0.8 for the second class.

    If you want to remove the weighted loss function, you can do so by setting the `weight` parameter to `None` in the `CrossEntropyLossFlat` function. Here's how you can do it:

    ```python
    learn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=accuracy, 
                        loss_func=CrossEntropyLossFlat(weight=None), 
                        cbs=[ShowGraphCallback])
    learn.fine_tune(6)
    ```

    In this case, the loss function will use the cross entropy loss without any weighting.
