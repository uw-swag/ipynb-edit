    ## RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)

    Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of artificial neural network that are capable of learning from sequences of data. They are particularly useful for tasks that involve sequential data, such as time series analysis, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
