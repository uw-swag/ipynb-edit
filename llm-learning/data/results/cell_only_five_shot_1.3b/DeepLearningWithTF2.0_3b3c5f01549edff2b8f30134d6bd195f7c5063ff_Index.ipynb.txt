    ### Response:
    The code you provided is removing the Colab notebook. If you're using Google Colab, you can remove it by going to the "File" menu in the toolbar, selecting "New notebook", and then selecting "Python" as the language. This will create a new notebook with Python as the default language.

    Here's how you can do it:

    1. Open Google Colab.
    2. Click on the "File" menu in the toolbar, then select "New notebook".
    3. In the "New Notebook" dialog, select "Python" as the language.
    4. Click "Create" to create a new notebook.

    After you've created a new notebook, you can delete the existing notebook by clicking on the "Delete" button in the toolbar.

    Here's how you can do it:

    1. Open Google Colab.
    2. Click on the "File" menu in the toolbar, then select "Delete".
    3. In the "Delete Notebook" dialog, select the notebook you want to delete.
    4. Click "Delete" to delete the notebook.

    Please note that you can't delete the notebook if it's currently open in a different tab or window.
