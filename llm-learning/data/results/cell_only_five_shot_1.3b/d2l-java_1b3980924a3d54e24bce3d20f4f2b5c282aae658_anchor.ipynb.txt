The code you provided seems to be a part of a machine learning model's prediction process. The issue you're facing is related to the display of the images. 

The code is trying to display the images in an external window, but it seems like the `ImageUtils.showImage(img2)` line is commented out, which is causing the images to not display. 

If you want to display the images, you should uncomment the `ImageUtils.showImage(img2)` line. If you want to display the images in a different way, you may need to modify the code to suit your needs.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
Image img2 = img.duplicate(Image.Type.TYPE_INT_ARGB);
drawBBoxes(img2, boxes.get(250, 250),
        new String[]{"s=0.75, r=1", "s=0.5, r=1", "s=0.25, r=1", "s=0.75, r=2", "s=0.75, r=0.5"});

// Uncomment to display image in an external window
// ImageUtils.showImage(img2);

// Rest of the code...
```

Please note that the `ImageUtils.showImage(img2)` line is commented out because it seems like the images are not being displayed. If you want to display the images, you should uncomment this line.
