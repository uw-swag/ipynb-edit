    The code you provided is a Python script that uses the scipy library to perform a t-test for each fold of a machine learning model. The t-test is used to compare the accuracy of two different models (`l_min`, `l_middle`, `l_max`, `m_min`, `m_middle`, `m_max`, `l_all`, `m_all`) on a dataset.

    The script first imports the necessary libraries and loads the data. It then defines two functions, `aggregate_predsV2` and `aggregate_predsV1`, which perform the t-test for each fold and return the accuracy and mean squared error for each model.

    The script then runs the t-test for each fold of the models and prints the p-values for each comparison. The p-values are the statistical significance of the t-test. A p-value below a chosen significance level (such as 0.05) indicates that the results of the test are statistically significant.

    The script also defines a list `all_cnns` that contains the predictions of all the models. The list is used to calculate the accuracy and mean squared error of the models.

    Finally, the script calculates the p-values for all the combinations of models and prints them. The p-values are the statistical significance of the t-test. A p-value below a chosen significance level (such as 0.05) indicates that the results of the test are statistically significant.

    Please note that the code provided is a part of a larger codebase and may not work as expected if run independently.
