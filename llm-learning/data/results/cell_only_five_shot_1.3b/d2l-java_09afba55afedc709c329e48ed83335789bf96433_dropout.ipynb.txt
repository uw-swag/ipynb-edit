    The code you've provided is a machine learning model training script using the Deep Java Library (DJL) and Apache Tablesaw. The script is designed to train a neural network on the FashionMNIST dataset, a dataset of Zalando's article images.

    The model is trained for 10 epochs, with a learning rate of 0.5 and a batch size of 256. The training loss and accuracy are recorded for each epoch. The script also calculates the test accuracy and plots these metrics over epochs.

    The model is saved with the name "model.djl".

    The code is written in Java, and it uses the DJL library for the neural network and the Apache Tablesaw library for data manipulation and visualization.

    The model is saved as a .djl file, which can be loaded and used for prediction.

    The code also uses the Apache Commons Lang library for array manipulation.

    The trained model is then used to predict the labels of the test set and the accuracy of the model is calculated.

    The code also generates a line plot of the training loss, test accuracy, and train accuracy over epochs.
