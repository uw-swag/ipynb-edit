    # Homework 7:
    # 
    # In this homework, you will be required to implement a function that calculates the sum of all elements in a list.
    # 
    # Here is a simple implementation in Python:

    def sum_of_elements(lst):
        return sum(lst)

    # Testing the function:
    print(sum_of_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: 15
