    Commit Message: "Added links to bualabs website related articles."
    Original Code Cells:
    '''
    # Importing necessary libraries
    import bs4 as bs
    import urllib.request

    # Specifying the url of the webpage
    source = urllib.request.urlopen('https://www.bualabs.com/').read()
    soup = bs.BeautifulSoup(source,'lxml')

    # Finding all the links
    for link in soup.find_all('a'):
        print(link.get('href'))
    '''
    ]

    ### Response:
    The code you provided is already complete. It uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML of the Bualabs website and print out all the links it finds.

    However, if you want to add these links to a list, you can modify the code like this:

    ```python
    # Importing necessary libraries
    import bs4 as bs
    import urllib.request

    # Specifying the url of the webpage
    source = urllib.request.urlopen('https://www.bualabs.com/').read()
    soup = bs.BeautifulSoup(source,'lxml')

    # Finding all the links
    links = []
    for link in soup.find_all('a'):
        links.append(link.get('href'))

    print(links)
    ```

    This will print out a list of all the links found on the Bualabs website.
