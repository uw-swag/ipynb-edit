# README PIPELINE

# The pipeline is designed to clean, preprocess, and analyze data from Yelp. The pipeline is divided into the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: The pipeline collects data from Yelp using the provided connection string.

2. **Data Cleaning**: The pipeline cleans the collected data by handling missing values, outliers, and duplicates.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: The pipeline preprocesses the data by converting categorical variables into numerical variables, handling missing values, and outliers.

4. **Data Analysis**: The pipeline analyzes the preprocessed data to identify patterns, trends, and insights.

5. **Data Storage**: The pipeline stores the processed data in a structured format (e.g., a pandas DataFrame) for future use.

# STORAGE

The data is stored in a PostgreSQL database. The database is set up with a table named 'model_data_regression' to store the processed data.

# STRUCTURE

The data is stored in a structured format, with each row representing a different review and each column representing a different feature. The features include:

- 'review_id'
- 'user_id'
- 'business_id'
- 'review_text'
- 'stars'
- 'useful'
- 'funny'
- 'cool'
- 'review_date'
- 'user_days_active_at_review_time'
- 'review_length'
- 'review_word_count'

# IMPROVEMENTS

The pipeline has been improved by:

1. **Data Cleaning**: The pipeline has been improved by handling missing values and outliers more effectively.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: The pipeline has been improved by converting categorical variables into numerical variables, handling missing values, and outliers more effectively.

3. **Data Analysis**: The pipeline has been improved by analyzing the data more effectively and identifying patterns, trends, and insights.

4. **Data Storage**: The pipeline has been improved by storing the data in a structured format, making it easier to analyze and use.
