    ### Response:
    The provided script is a Python script that uses the nbformat and nbconvert libraries to process all .ipynb files in a directory. The script reads each notebook, executes it, and then saves the notebook back out.

    However, there are a few potential issues that could be addressed:

    1. The script assumes that all notebooks are in the same directory as the script. If the notebooks are in a subdirectory, the script will not be able to find them
