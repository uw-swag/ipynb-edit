    # Section 14.2: Approximate Training
    # Approximate Training is a method used to estimate the performance of a model.

    ## 14.2.1 Approximate Training with a Gaussian Process Regression

    # Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is a probabilistic model that uses Gaussian kernels to model the function to be estimated.

    ## 14.2.2 Approximate Training with a Random Forest

    # Random Forest is a machine learning algorithm that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time.

    ## 14.2.3 Approximate Training with a Support Vector Machine

    # Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification or regression challenges.

    ## 14.2.4 Approximate Training with a Neural Network

    # Neural Networks are a class of deep learning models, which are inspired by the human brain.

    ## 14.2.5 Approximate Training with a K-Nearest Neighbors

    # K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a type of instance-based learning or non-generalizing learning algorithm.

    ## 14.2.6 Approximate Training with a Gradient Boosting

    # Gradient Boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees.

    ## 14.2.7 Approximate Training with a Bagging

    # Bagging is a method that combines multiple models to improve the performance of a model.

    ## 14.2.8 Approximate Training with a Boosting

    # Boosting is a method that combines multiple models to improve the performance of a model.

    ## 14.2.9 Approximate Training with a AdaBoost

    # AdaBoost is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees.
