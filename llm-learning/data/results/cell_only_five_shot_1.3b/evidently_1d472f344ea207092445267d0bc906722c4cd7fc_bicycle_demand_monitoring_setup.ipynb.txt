    # Tutorial for CS329S Workshop

    # Introduction
    # -----------
    # This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up a Python environment for the CS329S (Data Science) workshop.

    # Prerequisites
    # -------------
    # You should have a basic understanding of Python, as well as familiarity with the Jupyter notebook.

    # Step 1: Installing Python and Jupyter Notebook
    # -------------------------------------------------
    # You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
    # After installation, you can install Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```python
    pip install notebook
    ```

    # Step 2: Creating a new Jupyter notebook
    # -------------------------------------------
    # Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your notebook.
    # Then, run the following command to create a new Jupyter notebook:

    ```python
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    # Step 3: Importing the necessary libraries
    # -------------------------------------------
    # In your Jupyter notebook, you can import the necessary libraries by running the following code:

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
    from sklearn.svm import SVC
    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
    from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, auc
    from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve
    from sklearn.
