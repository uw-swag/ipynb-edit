    ## Conclusion
    The performance of the matrix multiplication operations (`matmul1`, `matmul2`, `matmul3`, `matmul4`, and `m1.matmul(m2)`) has been compared using the `%timeit` command.

    The results show that the `matmul1`, `matmul2`, `matmul3`, `matmul4`, and `m1.matmul(m2)` operations are generally faster than the `%timeit` command. This is because the `%timeit` command is used for measuring the time taken by the code to execute, while the `matmul1`, `matmul2`, `matmul3`, `matmul4`, and `m1.matmul(m2)` operations are typically more efficient in terms of computation time.
