    This function is used to calculate the mean squared error between two lists of numbers.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    y_true : list
        The list of true values.
    y_pred : list
        The list of predicted values.

    Returns:
    -------
    float
        The mean squared error between the true and predicted values.

            raise ValueError("The true and predicted values lists must be the same length.")
        return sum((y_true[i] - y_pred[i]) ** 2 for i in range(len(y_true))) / len(y_true)
    ```
    The function calculates the mean squared error between two lists of numbers. The mean squared error is a measure of the difference between the predicted and actual values. The function takes two parameters: `y_true` and `y_pred`, which are the true and predicted values, respectively. The function returns the mean squared error between the two lists.

    The function first checks if the true and predicted values lists have the same length. If they don't, it raises a `ValueError`. Then, it calculates the mean squared error by summing the squared differences between the true and predicted values, and dividing by the number of elements.

    The docstring of the function includes a description of the function, its parameters, and its return value.
