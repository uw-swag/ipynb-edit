    The code you provided is for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a dataset. The EDA process involves understanding the data, its characteristics, and the relationships between different variables. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    1. The code imports necessary libraries and loads the dataset.
    2. It then creates a list of all the dataframes in the dataset.
    3. It initializes the variables for the dataframes and the figure and axes.
    4. It then iterates over each dataframe in the list, calculating the average lot size, the oldest home age, and the size of the more popular relaxation space.
    5. It then plots the distribution of the residuals for each dataframe, with the mean and standard deviation of the distribution.
    6. It also calculates the accuracy of the model and the weight of each dataframe.
    7. It then plots the distribution of the residuals for all dataframes, with the mean and standard deviation of the distribution.
    8. It also calculates the accuracy of the model and the weight of all dataframes.
    9. It then displays the figure.

    The code also includes the following sections:

    - The part of the code that calculates the mean and standard deviation of the residuals for each dataframe.
    - The part of the code that calculates the accuracy of the model and the weight of each dataframe.
    - The part of the code that calculates the accuracy of the model and the weight of all dataframes.

    The code also includes the following print statements:

    - The part of the code that prints the mean and standard deviation of the residuals for each dataframe.
    - The part of the code that prints the accuracy of the model and the weight of each dataframe.
    - The part of the code that prints the accuracy of the model and the weight of all dataframes.

    The code also includes the following sections:
