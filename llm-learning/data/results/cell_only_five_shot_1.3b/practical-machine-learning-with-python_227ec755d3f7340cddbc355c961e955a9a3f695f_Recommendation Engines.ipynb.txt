    ### 10.1: Introduction to Data Structures

    #### 10.1.1: What are Data Structures?

    Data structures are a way of organizing, storing, and managing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. They are used to solve problems that are common in computer science, such as sorting, searching, and memory allocation.

    #### 10.1.2: Types of Data Structures

    There are several types of data structures in computer science, including:

    - **Arrays**: An array is a data structure that can store a fixed-size sequence of elements of the same type.

    - **Linked Lists**: A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Each element (node) of a linked list contains a reference to the next node in the sequence.

    - **Stacks**: A stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out).

    - **Queues**: A queue is a linear structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).

    - **Trees**: A tree is a widely used abstract data type (ADT) that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node.

    - **Graphs**: A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.

    #### 10.1.3: Importance of Data Structures

    Data structures play a crucial role in computer science. They are used to solve complex problems that involve data manipulation and retrieval. They provide efficient ways to store, retrieve, and manipulate data, which is crucial for many applications, such as databases, file systems, and software applications.
