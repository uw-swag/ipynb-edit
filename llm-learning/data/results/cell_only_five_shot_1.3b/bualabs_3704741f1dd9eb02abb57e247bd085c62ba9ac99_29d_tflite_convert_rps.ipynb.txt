```python
    # Intialize the TFLite converter to load the SavedModel
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model(RPS_SAVED_MODEL)

# Set the optimization strategy for 'size' in the converter 
converter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE]
converter.target_spec.supported_ops = [tf.lite.OpsSet.TFLITE_BUILTINS_INT8]
converter.inference_input_type = tf.uint8
converter.inference_output_type = tf.uint8

converter.experimental_new_converter = True
tflite_model_file = 'converted_model.tflite'

with open(tflite_model_file, "wb") as f:
    f.write(tflite_model)

    ```

    The code above is used to convert a TensorFlow SavedModel to a TFLite model. The TFLite model is then written to a file. The optimization strategy is set to 'size', which means that the TFLite model will be as small as possible. The inference input and output types are set to uint8, which means that the model will be able to process 8-bit integers.
