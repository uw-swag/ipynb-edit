```python
    import threading

    class ThreadSafeList:
        def __init__(self):
            self.list = []
            self.lock = threading.Lock()

        def append(self, item):
            with self.lock:
                self.list.append(item)

    # Usage
    thread_safe_list = ThreadSafeList()
    thread_safe_list.append(1)
    thread_safe_list.append(2)
    thread_safe_list.append(3)
    ```

    This code creates a thread-safe list using Python's built-in threading module. The list is appended to in a thread-safe manner, meaning that multiple threads can safely append to the list without causing any issues.
