    Here's how I would refactor the code to move the utils into its own subpackage, split into generic and material utilities.

    First, I would create a new package `ai.djl.utils`. Inside this package, I would create subpackages for `convolutional`, `core`, `pooling`, `training`, `dataset`, `modality`, `translate`, and `metric`.

    Then, I would move the utilities from the original code into the new packages. For example, I would move the `Conv2d`, `Linear`, `Pool`, `DefaultTrainingConfig`, `Trainer`, `TrainingListener`, `Loss`, `Optimizer`, `Tracker`, `Accuracy`, `FashionMnist`, `Resize`, `ToTensor`, `Pipeline`, `ArrayDataset`, `EasyTrain`, `Metrics`, `Dataset` from the original code into the new packages.

    Here's how the new code would look:

    ```java
    package ai.djl.utils.convolutional;

    import ai.djl.nn.convolutional.Conv2d;
    // other imports...

    public class ConvUtils {
        // methods for Conv2d...
    }
    ```

    Similarly, I would create subpackages for `core`, `dataset`, `modality`, `translate`, `dataset`, `metric`, etc.

    Then, I would move the utilities from the original code into the new packages.

    This way, the original code is cleaner and easier to maintain. It's also a good practice to keep the utilities separate from the main code, as it makes it easier to find and understand the code.
