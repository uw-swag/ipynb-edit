    TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. The importance increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus.

    In the code above, we are using the TfidfVectorizer from the sklearn.feature_extraction.text module to convert the text data into TF-IDF vectors. The TF-IDF score is a measure of how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. It is a measure of how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.
