    The code you provided is a part of a larger project, and it seems to be related to a deep learning model for image classification using the VGG16 model. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    1. The code imports necessary libraries and modules.
    2. It defines a function `ConvBlock` to create convolutional layers.
    3. It defines a function `FCBlock` to create fully connected layers.
    4. It defines a function `VGG_16` to create the VGG16 model.
    5. It loads the VGG16 model weights and preprocesses the input images.
    6. It defines a function `get_batches` to generate batches of images for training or validation.
    7. It uses the `get_batches` function to get batches of training and validation images.
    8. It uses the `pred_batch` function to predict the class of an image.

    The code is not related to the previous commit, as the previous commit was about creating a Dt model file and correcting some mistakes in previous model files. The code provided here is a part of a larger project, and it seems to be related to a deep learning model for image classification using the VGG16 model.

    Please let me know if you need help with anything else.
