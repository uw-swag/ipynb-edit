    The code you provided is a function that uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset. The function takes two parameters: `features`, which is a pandas DataFrame, and `pca_tolerance`, which is the number of principal components to retain.

    The function first selects all columns of `features` except the last one, which is the 'seizure' column. It then fits a PCA model to this data, with `n_components` set to `pca_tolerance`. The transformed data is then stored in a new DataFrame `red_ft`.

    The 'seizure' column from the original data is also added to the new DataFrame.

    Finally, the original columns of `features` and the new DataFrame are deleted to free up memory.

    The function returns the new DataFrame `red_ft`.

    The majority class undersampling is not a common technique used in machine learning. It's more commonly used in imbalanced datasets, where the number of samples in one class is much less than the number of samples in the other class.

    If you're looking to perform majority class undersampling, you might want to look into techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), which is a type of oversampling where you create new minority samples by using existing minority samples.

    However, the majority class undersampling technique you're using is not a common one and it's not recommended for imbalanced datasets. It's more common in imbalanced datasets where the number of samples in one class is much less than the number of samples in the other class.

    If you're looking to perform undersampling, you might want to look into techniques like random undersampling, which involves randomly removing samples from the majority class.

    If you're looking to perform oversampling, you might want to look into techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), which is a type of oversampling where you create new minority samples by using existing minority samples.

    If you're looking to perform a combination of undersampling and oversampling, you might want to look into techniques like SMOTE + undersampling
