    The `MixedTypes` check in Deepchecks is used to detect mixed data types in a DataFrame. It is a simple check that checks if the data types of the columns in the DataFrame are not all the same. If they are not all the same, it will return a warning.

    The original code is checking for mixed data types in the first DataFrame, and in the second DataFrame. The mixed data types in the first DataFrame are 'str', '1.0', 'timtam' and 'a', 'b', 'c'. The mixed data types in the second DataFrame are 'str', '1.0' and 'a'.

    The `MixedTypes` check is not perfect and may not always detect all mixed data types. It is a simple check and may not always return a warning.

    The original code is not modifying the DataFrame, but it is adding a new check to the DataFrame. The new check is a simple check that checks if the data types of the columns in the DataFrame are not all the same. If they are not all the same, it will return a warning.
