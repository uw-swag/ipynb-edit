    # Linear Algebra Practical 3: Solving Systems of Linear Equations

    # Part 1: System of Linear Equations

    # 1.1: Solve the following system of linear equations:
    # 2x + 3y = 10
    # 3x - y = 2

    # Solution:
    # We can solve this system of linear equations by substitution or elimination method.
    # Here, we will use elimination method.

    # Step 1: Create a matrix A
    A = np.array([[2, 3], [3, -1]])

    # Step 2: Create a matrix B
    B = np.array([10, 2])

    # Step 3: Solve the system of linear equations
    X = np.linalg.solve(A, B)

    print("The solution is: ", X)

    # Part 2: Plot the solution
    plt.figure()
    plt.plot(X[0], X[1], 'ro')
    plt.xlabel('x')
    plt.ylabel('y')
    plt.title('Plot of the solution')
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()
