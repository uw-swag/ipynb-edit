    The code you've provided is a Maven configuration for a project that uses the AI Deep Learning library (D2L Java). The version of the D2L Java book is bumped to 0.8.0.

    Here's a breakdown of the changes:

    - The Maven repository URL has been updated to use snapshots instead of releases. This is to ensure that the latest development versions of the libraries are used.

    - The `ai.djl:api`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-api`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-simple`, and `net.java.dev.jna:jna` dependencies have been updated to their latest versions. These are the core dependencies for the D2L Java book.

    - The `ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-engine` and `ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-native-auto` dependencies have also been updated to their latest versions. These are the dependencies for the MXNet engine and the MXNet native auto dependencies, respectively.

    Please note that the versions of these dependencies are subject to change as the project progresses.
