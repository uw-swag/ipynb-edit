    The code you provided is a demonstration of how to use the `EmbeddingsDriftMetric` from the `evidently` library to measure the embeddings data. 

    The `EmbeddingsDriftMetric` is a metric that calculates the difference between two embeddings and checks if the difference is statistically significant. The metric uses different methods to calculate the difference, such as model, distance, ratio, and MMD.

    The `run` method of the `Report` class is used to generate a report that includes the metrics. The `reference_data` and `current_data` parameters are used to specify the data to be compared. The `column_mapping` parameter is used to specify the column mapping.

    The `EmbeddingsDriftMetric` is then used in the `metrics` parameter of the `Report` to calculate the metric for the embeddings data.

    The `run` method is then called to generate the report.

    The report is then printed to the console.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the `distance` method of the `EmbeddingsDriftMetric` to calculate the distance between the embeddings. The `dist` parameter of the `distance` method is used to specify the distance to be calculated.

    The `EmbeddingsDriftMetric` is then used in the `metrics` parameter of the `Report` to calculate the metric for the embeddings data.

    The `run` method is then called to generate the report.

    The report is then printed to the console.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the `ratio` method of the `EmbeddingsDriftMetric` to calculate the ratio between the embeddings. The `ratio_threshold` parameter of the `ratio` method is used to specify the ratio threshold.

    The `EmbeddingsDriftMetric` is then used in the `metrics` parameter of the `Report` to calculate the metric for the embeddings data.

    The `run` method is then called to generate the report.

    The report is then printed to the console.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the `mmd` method of the `EmbeddingsDriftMetric` to calculate the MMD between the
