    The code provided is a Jupyter notebook that performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset. The EDA includes calculating the correlation between different features, visualizing the correlation matrix, and performing clustering on the data.

    The code is divided into several sections:

    1. Importing necessary libraries and modules.
    2. Calculating the correlation between different features.
    3. Plotting the correlation matrix.
    4. Performing clustering on the data.
    5. Visualizing the results of the clustering.

    The code is designed to be run in a Jupyter notebook environment. The results of the EDA are displayed in the notebook itself, which can be further analyzed or exported to a file.

    The code is written in Python, and it uses several libraries such as numpy, pandas, scipy, seaborn, and matplotlib.

    The code is divided into several sections, each of which is responsible for a specific task. The sections are:

    1. Importing necessary libraries and modules.
    2. Calculating the correlation between different features.
    3. Plotting the correlation matrix.
    4. Performing clustering on the data.
    5. Visualizing the results of the clustering.
