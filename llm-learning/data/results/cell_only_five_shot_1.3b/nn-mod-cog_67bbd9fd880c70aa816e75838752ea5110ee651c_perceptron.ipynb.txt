```python
    from sklearn.linear_model import ADALINE

    # Initialize the ADALINE model
    adaline = ADALINE()

    # Fit the model to the data
    adaline.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Predict the labels of the test set
    y_pred = adaline.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model
    print("Accuracy:", metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))

    # Limitations:
    # 1. ADALINE is a simple model and may not work well with non-linear data.
    # 2. It assumes that the data is linearly separable, which may not always be the case.
    # 3. It is not suitable for regression problems.
    # 4. It is not suitable for multiclass problems.
    # 5. It is not suitable for high dimensional data.
    ```
    This is a simple implementation of the ADALINE algorithm in Python using scikit-learn. The limitations of the algorithm include its simplicity, the assumption of linearity, and the lack of support for non-linear data and multiclass problems.
