    # Importing necessary libraries

    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
    from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

    # Loading the dataset
    data = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

    # Data preprocessing
    # This step depends on the nature of your data and the specific requirements of your analysis

    # Splitting the data into training and testing sets
    X = data.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
    y = data['target_variable']
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Training the model
    rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=1000, random_state=0)
    rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Making predictions
    predictions = rf.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluating the model
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
    mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions)
    r2 = r2_score(y_test, predictions)

    print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
    print(f'Mean Absolute Error: {mae}')
    print(f'R^2 Score: {r2}')

    # Save the model for future use
    import joblib
    joblib.dump(rf, 'model.pkl')
    ```
    This code will load your data, preprocess it, split it into training and testing sets, train a Random Forest model, make predictions, and evaluate the model. The model is then saved for future use.
