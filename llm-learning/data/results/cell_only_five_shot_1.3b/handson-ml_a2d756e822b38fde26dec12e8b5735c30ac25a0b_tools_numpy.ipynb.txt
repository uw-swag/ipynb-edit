```python
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
    y = np.sin(x)

    plt.plot(x, y)
    plt.show()
    ```

    ### Explanation:
    The typo in the code is in the import statement. The correct import statement is `import numpy as np`, not `import numpy as np`.
