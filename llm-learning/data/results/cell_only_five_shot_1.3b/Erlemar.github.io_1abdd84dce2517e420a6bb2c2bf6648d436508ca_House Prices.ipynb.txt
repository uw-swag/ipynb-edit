               'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms', 'Area Population', 'Price']

    model = LinearRegression()

    # Train the model

    predictions = model.predict(X_test)

    # Calculate the mean squared error of the predictions
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)

    print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')

    ```
    This script loads a dataset, selects some features, splits the data into a training set and a testing set, creates a linear regression model, trains the model, makes predictions, and calculates the mean squared error of the predictions. The model is then saved to a file.
