    This code is a part of a Kaggle competition. It uses DenseNet161 model for image classification. The DenseNet161 model is a type of DenseNet that includes 161 layers. The code also includes training, validation, and test sets.

    The code also includes Test Time Augmentation (TTA) for improving the model's performance. TTA is a technique that uses multiple augmentations of the same data sample to increase the robustness of the model.

    The code also includes predictions for the test set.

    The final part of the code is for submitting the model to the Kaggle competition.

    The code is written in Python and uses the fastai library for deep learning.

    The code is divided into several sections:

    1. The first section is for setting up the environment and downloading the dataset.

    2. The second section is for defining the model, training it, and saving it.

    3. The third section is for applying Test Time Augmentation (TTA) to the model.

    4. The fourth section is for making predictions on the test set.

    5. The last section is for submitting the model to the Kaggle competition.

    Please note that the code is a part of a Kaggle notebook and it may not work directly on a regular Python environment.
