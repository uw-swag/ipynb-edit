    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that includes several cells of different types, including code, markdown, and cell comments. Here's a brief explanation of what each type of cell does:

1. **Code Cells**: These are the main part of the notebook. They contain Python code that is executed by the notebook server.

2. **Markdown Cells**: These are used to format text and create notes. They start with a double tilde (`~~`) and end with a double tilde (`~~`).

3. **Cell Comments**: These are used to add comments to the code cells. They start with a hash (`#`) and end with a newline.

4. **Code Modules and Functions**: These cells are used to import and use functions and modules.

5. **Data Processing**: These cells are used to process the data. They download and prepare the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, and then map the images and labels to the correct format.

6. **CNN Construction**: These cells are used to construct the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. They define the architecture of the model, compile it, and train it.

7. **Display Examples**: These cells are used to display examples of the processed data.

8. **History Plotting**: These cells are used to plot the training history of the model.

9. **Display Reports**: These cells are used to display the classification report and confusion matrix.

10. **CNN Construction. One Channel**: These cells are used to construct the CNN model with one channel.

11. **CNN Construction. Three Channels**: These cells are used to construct the CNN model with three channels.

12. **Model Compilation and Training**: These cells are used to compile the model, train it, and save the best weights.

13. **History Plotting**: These cells are used to plot the training history of the model.

14. **Display Reports**: These cells are used to display the classification report and confusion matrix.

15. **Model Saving**: These cells are used to save the trained model.

16. **Model Loading**:
