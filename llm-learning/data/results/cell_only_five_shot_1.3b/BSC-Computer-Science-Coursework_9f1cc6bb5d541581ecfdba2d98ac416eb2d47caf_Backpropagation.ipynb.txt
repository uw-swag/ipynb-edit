    ## Feed Forward Algorithm

    The feed-forward algorithm is a simple yet effective method of training artificial neural networks. It is a type of supervised learning where the network is trained on a labeled dataset. The algorithm is called feed-forward because it passes the output of one layer as the input to the next layer.
