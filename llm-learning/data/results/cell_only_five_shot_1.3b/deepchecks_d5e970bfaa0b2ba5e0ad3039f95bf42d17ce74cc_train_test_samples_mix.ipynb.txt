```python
    # Changing package structure

    # Before
    from my_package import my_module

    # After
    from my_package.my_module import my_function
    ```

    ### Explanation
    The package structure has been changed from `my_package.my_module` to `my_package.my_module.my_function`. This change is made to maintain the Python import system's hierarchy.

    ### Code
    ```python
    # Changing package structure

    # Before
    from my_package import my_module

    # After
    from my_package.my_module import my_function
    ```

    ### Reason
    The change is made to maintain the Python import system's hierarchy.

    ### Impact
    The impact of this change is that the import system will now correctly import the function `my_function` from the `my_module` in the `my_package` package.

    ### Solution
    The solution to this problem is to update the import statement in the code to the new package structure.
