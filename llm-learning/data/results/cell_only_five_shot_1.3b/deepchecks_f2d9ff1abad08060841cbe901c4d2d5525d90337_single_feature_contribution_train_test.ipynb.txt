    The code you provided is a part of a DeepChecks check, which is a library for automated machine learning inspection. The check `SingleFeatureContributionTrainTest` is used to evaluate the contribution of a single feature to the model's prediction.

    The `ppscore_params` parameter in the `SingleFeatureContributionTrainTest` check is a dictionary that specifies the parameters for the PPS (Percentage Point Score) calculation. The `ppscore_params` dictionary has a 'sample' key, which is used to specify the number of samples to use for the PPS calculation.
