```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

    # Assuming df is your DataFrame and 'column1', 'column2' are the two categorical columns
    crosstab = pd.crosstab(df['column1'], df['column2'])

    # Perform Chi-Square Test
    chi2, p, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(crosstab)

    print("Chi-Square statistic: ", chi2)
    print("p-value: ", p)
    print("Degrees of freedom: ", dof)
    print("Expected frequencies table: ", expected)
    ```

    This code will perform a multi-category Chi-Square test on the two columns provided. The test is performed on the crosstab (a contingency table) of the two columns. The Chi-Square statistic, p-value, degrees of freedom, and expected frequencies table are all calculated and printed.

    The p-value is the probability that the observed frequencies would have occurred by chance, assuming the null hypothesis is true. If the p-value is less than the chosen significance level (usually 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the observed frequencies do not occur by chance.

    The degrees of freedom are the number of categories in each of the two columns. In a Chi-Square test, the degrees of freedom are the number of categories in the categorical variable.

    The expected frequencies table is the expected number of occurrences of the categorical variables in the rows and columns of the crosstab.

    The Chi-Square statistic is a measure of the observed frequencies in the contingency table compared to the expected frequencies. A large Chi-Square statistic (close to the expected frequencies) indicates a strong association between the two categorical variables.

    The Chi-Square test is used to test the hypothesis that the categorical variables are independent. If the p-value is greater than the chosen significance level, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the categorical variables are not independent.
