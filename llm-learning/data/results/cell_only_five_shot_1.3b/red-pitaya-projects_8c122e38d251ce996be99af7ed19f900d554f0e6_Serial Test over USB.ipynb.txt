    2. The `read_serial_data` and `clean_serial_data` functions are not defined. You need to implement these functions to read the serial data and clean it as per your requirements.

    3. The `df` variable is not updated in the `collect_data` function. You need to update the `df` variable in the `collect_data` function.

    4. The `keep_running` variable is not updated in the `collect_data` function. You need to update the `keep_running` variable in the `collect_data` function.

    5. The `df` variable is not updated in the `collect_data` function. You need to update the `df` variable in the `collect_data` function.
