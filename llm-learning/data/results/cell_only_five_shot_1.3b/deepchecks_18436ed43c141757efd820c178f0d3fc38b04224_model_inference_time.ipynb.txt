    ## Linear Regression

    Linear Regression is a simple and popular machine learning algorithm used for predicting a target variable based on one or more predictor variables.

    Here is an example of how to use Linear Regression in Python:

    ```python
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

    # Create a Linear Regression object
    lr = LinearRegression()

    # Fit the model with data
    lr.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions on the test data
    y_pred = lr.predict(X_test)
    ```

    ## Lasso Regression

    Lasso Regression is a type of linear regression that uses a technique called L1 regularization. It is used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function.

    Here is an example of how to use Lasso Regression in Python:

    ```python
    from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso

    # Create a Lasso Regression object
    lasso = Lasso(alpha=1.0)

    # Fit the model with data
    lasso.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions on the test data
    y_pred = lasso.predict(X_test)
    ```

    ## Support Vector Regression

    Support Vector Regression is a type of linear regression that uses a technique called SVR. It is used to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that distinctly classifies the data points.

    Here is an example of how to use Support Vector Regression in Python:

    ```python
    from sklearn.svm import SVR

    # Create a SVR object
    svr = SVR(gamma='scale')

    # Fit the model with data
    svr.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions on the test data
    y_pred = svr.predict(X_test)
    ```
