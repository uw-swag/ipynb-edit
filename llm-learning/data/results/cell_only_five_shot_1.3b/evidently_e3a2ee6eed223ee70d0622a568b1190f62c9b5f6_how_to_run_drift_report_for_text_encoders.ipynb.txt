The code provided is an example of how to use the `evidently` library to analyze the data drift between two datasets. The code is divided into several steps:

1. Loading the datasets.
2. Preprocessing the data: converting the text data into sentence vectors using GloVe embeddings.
3. Performing a data drift analysis: comparing the distribution of features in the two datasets.
4. Visualizing the results: creating a data drift dashboard to visualize the results.

The code is written in Python and uses several libraries such as pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, and evidently. The `evidently` library is used to perform the data drift analysis.

Please note that the code provided is a simplified example and may not work as-is. It is meant to illustrate the process of using the `evidently` library to analyze data drift. The actual implementation may vary depending on the specific requirements of your project.
