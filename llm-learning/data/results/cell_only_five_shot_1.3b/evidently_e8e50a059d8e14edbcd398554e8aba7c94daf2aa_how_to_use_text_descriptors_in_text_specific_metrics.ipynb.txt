    The code you provided is a demonstration of how to use the `evidently` library to perform descriptors-based analysis on a dataset. 

    The `evidently` library is a Python library for creating and analyzing visual reports of data quality. It provides a set of metrics and descriptors that can be used to measure the quality of data.

    The code is divided into three parts:

    1. The first part of the code is a demonstration of how to use descriptors to measure the quality of text data. The descriptors used in this example are:

       - Text Length
       - Trigger Words Presence
       - OOV
       - Non Letter Character Percentage

    2. The second part of the code is a demonstration of how to use descriptors to measure the quality of text data, with an additional step of text overview.

    3. The third part of the code is a demonstration of how to use descriptors to measure the quality of text data, with a final step of column drift.

    The code also includes a final `Report` object that is used to run the analysis. The `Report` object is a container for a set of metrics, and it provides a method to run the analysis on a set of data.

    The final `Report` objects are used to visualize the results of the analysis, and they can be printed or saved to a file.

    The code is written in Python, and it uses the `evidently` library, which is a part of the evidently project.
