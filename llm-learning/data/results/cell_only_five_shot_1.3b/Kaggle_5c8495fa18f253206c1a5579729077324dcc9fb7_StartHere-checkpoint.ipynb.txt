```python
    # Define the function to calculate the weight
    def gifts(x):
        if x == 'Gift1':
            return 0.1
        elif x == 'Gift2':
            return 0.2
        elif x == 'Gift3':
            return 0.3
        elif x == 'Gift4':
            return 0.4
        else:
            return 0.5

    # Apply the function to the 'type' column
    data['weight'] = data['type'].apply(gifts)

    # Calculate the ensemble average
    ensemble_average = data['weight'].mean()
    print(ensemble_average)
    ```

    This code will calculate the ensemble average of the 'weight' column. The 'weight' column is defined as a function of the 'type' column, and the function is defined as a dictionary where the keys are the 'type' values and the values are the corresponding weights. The ensemble average is then calculated as the mean of the 'weight' column.
