```python
    # Import necessary libraries
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

    # Load the dataset
    df = pd.read_csv('chapter8.csv')

    # Split the dataset into features and target variable
    X = df.drop('target', axis=1)
    y = df['target']

    # Split the dataset into training set and test set
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Standardize the features
    sc = StandardScaler()
    X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = sc.transform(X_test)

    # Save the standardized dataset
    pd.DataFrame(X_train).to_csv('chapter8_train.csv', index=False)
    pd.DataFrame(X_test).to_csv('chapter8_test.csv', index=False)
    ```
    This code will load a dataset from a CSV file, split it into a training set and a test set, and then standardize the features. The standardized features will be saved to new CSV files for later use.
