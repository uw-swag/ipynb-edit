    The code you provided is a SQL query that is used to analyze sales data by country. The query uses several tables (CustomerCountByCountry_Info, LifeTimeSalesPerCustomerPerCountry_Info, OrdersByCountry_Info, and country_sales_info) to calculate various metrics such as the number of customers, the total sales, the average order value, and the customer lifetime value.

    The results are then displayed in a bar chart, with the countries on the x-axis and the corresponding metrics on the y-axis. The colors of the bars represent the average order value.

    The query is designed to answer the business question "What are the top 10 countries with the highest average order value?". This is a common business question that can be answered by looking at the top 10 countries with the highest average order value.

    Please note that the code provided is a template and may need to be adjusted to fit your specific needs.
