The code provided is a series of operations performed on a dataset using DeepChecks, a Python library for data analysis and visualization. The operations include loading a dataset, running a simple feature contribution check, and performing some transformations on the dataset.

The code is deleting notebooks because it's not clear what the purpose of these notebooks is. They are not part of the original instructions, but they are no longer needed after the code has been run.

If you want to delete these notebooks, you can use the following code:

```python
import os
import shutil

notebooks_path = "../path/to/your/notebooks"
for filename in os.listdir(notebooks_path):
    file_path = os.path.join(notebooks_path, filename)
    if os.path.isfile(file_path):
        os.remove(file_path)
```

This code will delete all files in the specified directory. Please replace "../path/to/your/notebooks" with the actual path to your notebooks directory.
