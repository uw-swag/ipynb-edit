    The code you provided is a KFP (Kubeflow Pipelines) pipeline that automates the process of creating a dataset, training a model, and deploying the model.

    The pipeline is defined in the `pipeline` function. This function is decorated with `@AutoMLOps.pipeline`, which means it's a pipeline that will be automatically monitored, retrained, and deployed.

    The pipeline parameters are defined in the `pipeline_params` dictionary. These parameters are used to configure the pipeline when it's run.

    The pipeline is run using the `AutoMLOps.generate` and `AutoMLOps.provision` methods. These methods are used to create and provision the pipeline resources.

    The pipeline is then deployed using the `AutoMLOps.deploy` method.

    The pipeline is then monitored using the `AutoMLOps.monitor` method. This method is used to monitor the pipeline and trigger retraining if the model performance degrades.

    The pipeline is then retrained with the new parameters.

    The pipeline is then deployed again with the new parameters.

    The pipeline is then monitored again to check the model performance.

    The pipeline is then deployed again with the new parameters.

    The pipeline is then monitored again to check the model performance.

    The pipeline is then deployed again with the new parameters.

    The pipeline is then monitored again to check the model performance.

    The pipeline is then deployed again with the new parameters.
