    Here is the updated code:

    ```python
    # Load experimental data
    expdata = np.load('test_img.npy')
    # Get NN output with coordinates and classes
    nn_input, (nn_output, coordinates) = aoi.atomnet.predictor(
        model, use_gpu=False).run(expdata)
    ```

    This code is for a machine learning model named `model`. The `predictor` function is a method of the `atomnet` module, which is part of the `aoi` package. The `run` function is a method of the `predictor` object, which is used to get the output of the neural network with coordinates and classes.

    Please note that the version of the `aoi` package and the `model` are not specified in the original code. You may need to adjust the code to match the version of the `aoi` package and the `model` you are using.
