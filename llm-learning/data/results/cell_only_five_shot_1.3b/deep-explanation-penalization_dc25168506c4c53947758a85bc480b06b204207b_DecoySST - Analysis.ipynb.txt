The code you provided is for training a model with the 'annot' in the filename. This is a common technique used in adversarial training, where the model is trained to minimize a loss function that is combined with a regularization term. The regularization term is a term that encourages the model to produce a small weight vector, which can be interpreted as a "good" or "annotated" model.

However, the code you provided is incomplete and does not provide a complete solution. It is missing the part where the model is trained and the results are stored. Here is a complete version of the code:
