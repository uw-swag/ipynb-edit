```python
    from deepchecks import Dataset

    # We explicitly state that this dataset has no categorical features, otherwise they will be automatically inferred
    # If the dataset has categorical features, the best practice is to pass a list with their names

    ds_train = Dataset(df_train, label_name=label_col, cat_features=[], use_default_index=False)
    ds_test =  Dataset(df_test,  label_name=label_col, cat_features=[])
    # note that we set check_datasets_policy to 'both' so that for single dataset checks (e.g. some of the integrity checks),
    # both the test and the train data will be checked.

    suite.run(train_dataset=ds_train, test_dataset=ds_test, model=rf_clf)
    ```
