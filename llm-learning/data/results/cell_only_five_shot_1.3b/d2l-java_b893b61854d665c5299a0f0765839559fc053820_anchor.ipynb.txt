The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook, and it seems to be related to the SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) algorithm. The code is duplicating the image and then calling a function `drawBBoxes` to draw bounding boxes on the image.

The `drawBBoxes` function seems to be a part of a different library or framework, and it's not clear what it does. It seems to be a function that takes an image, a set of bounding boxes, and a list of labels, and it draws the bounding boxes and labels on the image.

The code is also calling `getWrappedImage()`, which seems to be a method of the `Image` class in Java. This method seems to return the wrapped image, but it's not clear what it does.

The code is also calling `duplicate` on the `img` object, which seems to be a method of the `Image` class in Java. This method seems to duplicate the image, but it's not clear what it does.

The code is also calling `get` on the `output` object, which seems to be a method of the `NDArray` class in Java. This method seems to get an element from the array, but it's not clear what it does.

The code is also calling `reshape` and `get` on the `bbox` object, which seems to be a method of the `NDArray` class in Java. This method seems to reshape the array and get an element from it, but it's not clear what it does.

The code is also calling `get` on the `bbox` object twice, which seems to be a method of the `NDArray` class in Java. This method seems to get an element from the array, but it's not clear what it does.
