    Here is a reduced version of your code. I've removed the unnecessary variables and functions, and replaced them with more readable and concise code.

```java
int numEpochs = 500;
int lr = 1;
train(net, trainIter, vocab, lr, numEpochs);
```

In this version, the `train` function is called with the necessary parameters. The `train` function is responsible for training the network.

Please note that the `train` function is not defined in the provided code, so I can't provide a more specific solution.
