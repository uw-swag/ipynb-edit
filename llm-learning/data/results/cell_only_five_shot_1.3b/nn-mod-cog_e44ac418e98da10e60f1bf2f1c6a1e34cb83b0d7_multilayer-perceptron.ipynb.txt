    ### Response:
    The error in the code is in the line where the MLPClassifier is created. The hidden_layer_sizes parameter should be a tuple specifying the number of neurons in each layer. In the current code, it's set to (10, 10, 10), which means there are three layers with 10 and 10 neurons respectively. This is not the correct number of layers for a multilayer perceptron.

    The correct way to set the number of layers in the MLPClassifier is as follows:

    ```python
    mlp = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(10, ), max_iter=1000)
    ```

    This will create a multilayer perceptron with one hidden layer with 1
