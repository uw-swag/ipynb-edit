# Python Tutorial

# Introduction

# Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose dynamic programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation.

# Python Syntax

# Python uses indentation to delimit blocks, which is known as Python syntax.

# Variables

# In Python, you can assign a value to a variable with the assignment operator (=).

# Python Variables

# Python has several types of variables. The most common ones are:

# 1. Local Variables: These are created inside a function and can be used only within that function.
# 2. Global Variables: These are created outside a function and can be used by any function in the program.
# 3. Instance Variables: These are created inside a class and can be used by any method in the class.

# Python Data Types

# Python has several data types including:

# 1. Integer: It is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.
# 2. Float: It is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.
# 3. String: It is a sequence of characters.
# 4. List: It is an ordered collection of items, changeable and indexed.
# 5. Tuple: It is a collection of items, ordered and unchangeable.
# 6. Dictionary: It is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which unlike other Data Types that hold only single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair.

# Python Control Structures

# Python uses control structures to decide the flow of the program. The most common ones are:

# 1. If-Else: It is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
# 2. For: It is used to iterate over a sequence (that can be a list, tuple, string, or set) or other iterable objects.
# 3. While: It is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.
