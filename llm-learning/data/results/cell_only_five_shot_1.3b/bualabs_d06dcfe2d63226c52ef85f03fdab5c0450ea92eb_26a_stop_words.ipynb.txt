```python
    # Importing necessary libraries
    import nltk
    from nltk.corpus import stopwords
    nltk.download('stopwords')

    # Creating a list of English stop words
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))

    # Example usage:
    text = "This is an example sentence for NLP stop words."
    word_tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
    filtered_sentence = [w for w in word_tokens if not w in stop_words]

    print(filtered_sentence)
    ```
    This code will print out the same sentence, but with all the stop words removed.
