```python
    import os
    import shutil

    # Path to the directory where the test images are stored
    test_image_dir = 'path/to/test/images'

    # Get a list of all the test images
    test_images = os.listdir(test_image_dir)

    # Loop through each test image and remove it
    for image in test_images:
        # Construct the full file path of the image
        image_path = os.path.join(test_image_dir, image)

        # Remove the image
        os.remove(image_path)
    ```
    This script will remove all the test images from the specified directory. Please replace 'path/to/test/images' with the actual path to your test images directory.
