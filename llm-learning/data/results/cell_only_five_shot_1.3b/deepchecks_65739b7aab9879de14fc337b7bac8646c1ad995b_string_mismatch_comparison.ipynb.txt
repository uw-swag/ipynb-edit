    ### Response:
    The GitHub action you've provided is a YAML file that defines a workflow for a GitHub action. This workflow is triggered on every push to the `master` branch. The workflow consists of three steps:

    1. `Checkout code`: This step checks out your repository so that it can be used by the subsequent steps.

    2. `Setup Python`: This step sets up Python 3.8 on the runner.

    3. `Install Dependencies`: This step installs the necessary dependencies for the `links-check` step.

    4. `Run Links Check`: This step runs the `links_check` script, which is not defined in your original code.

    If you want to run a script that checks the links, you would need to define that script in a file named `links_check.py` in the root directory of your repository. The `links_check` script would then be invoked in the `Run Links Check` step.

    Please replace the `links_check` script with your actual script.
