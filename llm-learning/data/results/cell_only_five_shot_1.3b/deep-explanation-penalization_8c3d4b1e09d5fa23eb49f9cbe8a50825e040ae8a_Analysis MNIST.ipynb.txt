    The provided code is a part of a larger project, and it's not clear what the purpose of this code is. It seems to be a part of a machine learning project, where the goal is to train a model on the MNIST dataset and evaluate its performance.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    1. The code imports necessary libraries and modules.
    2. It loads the results from the previous project.
    3. It preprocesses the results data, cleaning it up and preparing it for further analysis.
    4. It defines a neural network model for the MNIST dataset.
    5. It trains the model and evaluates its performance on the test set.
    6. It plots the test accuracy as a function of regularization strength for different methods of regularization.

    The code is not complete and there are a few areas that could be improved:

    1. The regularization strength is not log-scaled, which could lead to misleading results.
    2. The code does not handle the case where the model training fails.
    3. The code does not save the results to a file.
    4. The code does not include any error handling for the loading of the data.
    5. The code does not include any error handling for the model training.
    6. The code does not include any error handling for the model evaluation.
    7. The code does not include any error handling for the plotting.

    Please provide more context or clarify what you want to achieve with this code.
