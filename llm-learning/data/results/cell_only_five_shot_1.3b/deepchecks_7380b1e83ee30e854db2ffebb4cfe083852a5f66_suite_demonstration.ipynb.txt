```python
    # Importing necessary libraries
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

    # Load the dataset
    df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

    # Split the dataset into features and target variable
    X = df.drop('target_column', axis=1)
    y = df['target_column']

    # Split the dataset into training set and test set
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Create a Logistic Regression model
    model = LogisticRegression()

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions on the test set
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Calculate the accuracy of the model
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')

    # Check the model's performance
    # This is a placeholder for your checks demo
    # You should replace it with your actual code for checks demo
    # For example:
    # Check for overfitting:
    # if model.score(X_test, y_test) < model.score(X_train, y_train):
    #     print('Overfitting detected')

    # Check for drift:
    # if np.abs(y_test.mean() - y_pred.mean()) > 10:
    #     print('Drift detected')

    # Basic usage example:
    new_data = pd.DataFrame({
        'feature1': [1, 2, 3],
        'feature2': [4, 5, 6]
    })
    new_predictions = model.predict(new_data)
    print(new_predictions)
