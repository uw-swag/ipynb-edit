```python
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

    # Load the dataset
    df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

    # Define the features and the target variable
    X = df.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
    y = df['target_variable']

    # Create a Logistic Regression model
    model = LogisticRegression()

    # Perform 10-fold cross-validation
    scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=10)

    # Print the mean score
    print("Mean cross-validation score: %.2f" % scores.mean())

    # Print the standard deviation of the scores
    print("Standard deviation of cross-validation score: %.2f" % scores.std())
    ```
    This code will perform 10-fold cross-validation on a Logistic Regression model. The mean score and the standard deviation of the scores will be printed.

    Please replace 'your_dataset.csv' and 'target_variable' with your actual dataset file and target variable.

    Note: This code assumes that your dataset is in a CSV file and that the target variable is the column you want to predict.

    Also, this code does not include any data preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values or encoding categorical variables. You may need to add these steps based on your specific dataset.

    Finally, this code does not include any hyperparameter tuning. You may need to add a grid search or random search to tune the hyperparameters of the Logistic Regression model.

    This is a basic example of how to perform cross-validation in Python using the scikit-learn library.
