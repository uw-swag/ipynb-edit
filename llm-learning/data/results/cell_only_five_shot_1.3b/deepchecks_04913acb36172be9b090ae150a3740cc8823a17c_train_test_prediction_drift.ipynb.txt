The code you provided is a modification of a PyTorch DataLoader, which is used to load data in a way that is compatible with PyTorch's DataParallel or DistributedDataParallel. The `collate_test` function is used to modify the data in a way that is compatible with the `collate_fn` argument in the DataLoader.

In this case, the function is used to randomly select a certain percentage of data from each class in the dataset. The class to which each data point belongs is preserved, but the data points are selected randomly from each class.

The `default_collate` function is used to ensure that the data is in the correct format for the DataLoader.

The `mod_train_loader` and `mod_test_loader` are the DataLoaders that are created from the modified dataset.

Please note that the `collate_test` function is a simple example and may not be suitable for all use cases. It's important to choose a function that accurately represents the data you're working with.
