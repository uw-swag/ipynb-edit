    ## Day 4 Notebooks Updated to work on the server
    ## Removed examples with dashboards and profiles from sample_notebooks
    ## Updated readme with an example of how to generate test generators usage
    ## Added an example with test generators usage to how_to_questions

    ## HOW TO GENERATE TEST GENERATORS USAGE
    ## 1. Import the necessary libraries
    ## 2. Define the test generator
    ## 3. Use the test generator to generate test data

    ## HOW TO QUESTIONS
    ## 1. Define a question
    ## 2. Use the question to evaluate the model
    ## 3. Generate a question to ask the model

    ## EXAMPLE
    ## Suppose we have a model that predicts whether an email is spam or not.
    ## We can define a test generator to generate test data for the model.
    ## The test generator can be a function that generates random emails.
    ## We can use this test generator to generate test data and evaluate the model.

    ## EXAMPLE
    ## Suppose we want to generate a question to ask the model.
    ## We can define a question that asks the model to predict whether an email is spam or not.
    ## We can use this question to evaluate the model.

    ## EXAMPLE
    ## Suppose we want to generate a test data set for the model.
    ## We can define a test generator that generates random emails.
    ## We can use this test generator to generate test data.

    ## EXAMPLE
    ## Suppose we want to evaluate the model.
    ## We can use the test data set to evaluate the model.
    ## The model will generate predictions and compare them to the actual values.

    ## EXAMPLE
    ## Suppose we want to generate a dashboard to visualize the model's performance.
    ## We can define a dashboard and calculate the model's performance.
    ## We can use the calculated data to generate the dashboard.
