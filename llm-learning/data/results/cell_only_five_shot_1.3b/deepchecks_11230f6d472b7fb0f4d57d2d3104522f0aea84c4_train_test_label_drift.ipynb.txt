```python
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

    # Assuming df is your DataFrame and 'label' is the column you want to label
    le = LabelEncoder()
    df['label'] = le.fit_transform(df['label'])

    # Now df['label'] is a numeric representation of the labels
    # You can use this numeric representation to train your model

    # For example, if you are using a classification model, you can use this as the target
    y = df['label']

    # And the features as the input
    X = df.drop('label', axis=1)

    # Now you can train your model using X and y
    ```
