    The code you provided is a set of tests for data drift detection in machine learning. The tests are performed using the Mann-Whitney U-rank test, a non-parametric test that compares the distributions of two independent groups. The tests are run for different sample sizes and the results are stored in a pandas DataFrame.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The `give_me_smp_cntr_df` function generates two dataframes, `smp_df` and `cntr_df`, that represent the sample and control groups for the tests.
    - The `StatTest` class is used to define the tests to be performed. The Mann-Whitney U-rank test is defined as `mann_whitney_u_stat_test`.
    - The `TestSuite` class is used to run the tests on the data.
    - The `create_test_result_dataset` function is used to create a DataFrame that contains the test results.
    - The code then generates histograms and line plots to visualize the results.

    The code is divided into several sections, each of which performs a specific task. For example, the section for generating the data, the section for running the tests, and the section for creating the visualizations. Each section is commented to explain what it does.

    The code also includes a section for generating a gamma distribution, a section for running the tests on this distribution, and a section for creating the visualizations.

    The code is written in Python and uses several libraries, including pandas, numpy, scipy, sklearn, and plotly.

    The code is designed to be run in a Google Colab environment, as it uses the `!wget` command to download files.

    The code is also designed to be reusable, as it can be used to perform data drift detection on any dataset.

    The code is commented to explain what each part of the code does, which is a good practice for writing clean, understandable code.
