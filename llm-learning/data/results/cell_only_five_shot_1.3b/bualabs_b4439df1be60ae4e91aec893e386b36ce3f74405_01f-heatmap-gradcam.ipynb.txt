    # Add description on backpropagation
    # Backpropagation is a fundamental algorithm in machine learning that is used to train neural networks. It is a way of calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network.

    # Update sample picture to pug
    # Pugs are known for their soft coats and playful names. They are often used as pets or pets in social situations.

    # Show heatmap
    # A heatmap is a graphical representation of data where the color intensity of each cell indicates the value of a variable. In the context of image processing, a heatmap is a visualization of the intensity of different colors in an image.

    # Backpropagation
    # Backpropagation is a method used to calculate the gradient of the loss function. It is a way of adjusting the weights of the network to minimize the loss.

    # One cycle
    # One cycle refers to the process of training a model for a number of epochs, where the learning rate is adjusted at the start and end of each epoch. This is a common technique in training deep learning models.

    # Fit one cycle
    # The fit_one_cycle method is used to train a model for a number of epochs, where the learning rate is adjusted at the start and end of each epoch.

    # Model evaluation
    # The model is evaluated on a validation set, and the results are used to adjust the learning rate.

    # Show heatmap
    # A heatmap is a graphical representation of data where the color intensity of each cell indicates the value of a variable. In the context of image processing, a heatmap is a visualization of the intensity of different colors in an image.

    # Pug
    # Pugs are known for their soft coats and playful names. They are often used as pets or pets in social situations.

    # Day 6 slides
    # Day 6 slides are a presentation that discusses the importance of backpropagation, one cycle, and the use of heatmaps in image processing.
