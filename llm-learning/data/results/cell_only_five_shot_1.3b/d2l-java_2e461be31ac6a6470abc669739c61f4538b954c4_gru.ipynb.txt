    It seems like you're trying to add a section to your Maven configuration for sequence-to-sequence learning using Deep Java Library (DJL). However, your code is not formatted correctly. Here's a corrected version of your code:

    ```
    %mavenRepo snapshots https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/
    %maven org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.26
    %maven org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:1.7.26
    
    %maven ai.djl:api:0.11.0-SNAPSHOT
    %maven ai.djl:basicdataset:0.11.0-SNAPSHOT

    // See https://github.com/deepjavalibrary/djl/blob/master/mxnet/mxnet-engine/README.md
    // MXNet 
    %maven ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-engine:0.11.0-SNAPSHOT
    %maven ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-native-auto:1.7.0-backport
    ```

    This code will add the necessary Maven repositories and dependencies for sequence-to-sequence learning using the Deep Java Library (DJL). The `%maven` directive is used to define Maven artifacts, and the `%mavenRepo` directive is used to define a repository.

    Please note that the versions of the dependencies (`0.11.0-SNAPSHOT`) used in this code are placeholders. You should replace them with the actual versions of the dependencies you want to use.

    Also, please ensure that the Maven configuration is correctly set up in your environment. If you're using a build tool like Maven or Gradle, you'll need to configure it to use this Maven configuration.
