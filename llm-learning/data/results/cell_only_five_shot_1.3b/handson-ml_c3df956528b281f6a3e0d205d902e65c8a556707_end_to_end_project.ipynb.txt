    Commit Message: "Adding missing imports for TensorFlow and Keras"
    Original Code:
    '''
    import numpy as np
    import tensorflow as tf
    from tensorflow import keras
    # data
    xs = np.array([-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4], dtype=float)
    ys = np.array([-3, -1, 1, 3, 5, 7], dtype=float)
    model = keras.Sequential([
        keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=[1])
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mean_squared_error')
    model.fit(xs, ys, epochs=500)
    print(model.predict([10.0]))
    '''
    ]

    ### Response:
    Here are the missing imports for TensorFlow and Keras:

    ```python
    import tensorflow as tf
    from tensorflow import keras
    ```

    These imports are necessary for the TensorFlow and Keras libraries, which are used to build and train the model.
