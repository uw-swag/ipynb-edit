    # Removing .git/lfs/objects/
    # This is a temporary step, as Git LFS is not needed anymore.
    # You can remove this line if you want to keep Git LFS.
    # However, it's not recommended to remove it as it might lead to data loss.

    # If you want to remove .git/lfs/objects/ directory, you can use the following command:
    # git lfs uninstall

    # If you want to keep .git/lfs/objects/ directory, you can use the following command:
    # git lfs install

    # If you want to keep .git/lfs/objects/ directory but not use it, you can use the following command:
    # git lfs track <file>
    # git lfs install
    ```
