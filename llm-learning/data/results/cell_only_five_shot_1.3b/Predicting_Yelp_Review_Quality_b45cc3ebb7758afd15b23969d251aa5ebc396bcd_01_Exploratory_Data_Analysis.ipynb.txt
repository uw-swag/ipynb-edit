    from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer
    from sklearn.decomposition import LatentDirichletAllocation

    # Loading the dataset
    df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

    # Feature Engineering
    # Count Vectorizer
    count_vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')
    count_data = count_vectorizer.fit_transform(df['your_text_column'])

    # TF-IDF Vectorizer
    tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
    tfidf_data = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(df['your_text_column'])

    # Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
    lda = LatentDirichletAllocation(n_components=10)
    lda.fit(tfidf_data)

    # Creating a dataframe for the LDA topics
    lda_df = pd.DataFrame(data=lda.transform(tfidf_data), columns=lda.components_.columns_)

    # Adding the LDA dataframe to the original dataframe
    df = pd.concat([df, lda_df], axis=1)

    # Now you can use the 'your_text_column' and 'lda_df' columns in your further analysis

    # Note: Replace 'your_text_column' and 'your_data.csv' with your actual text column and data file.

    # Also, you can adjust the number of components in the LDA model according to your needs.

    # This is a basic example. Depending on your specific use case, you may need to perform more complex feature engineering.

    # Also, remember to preprocess your text data (e.g., lowercasing, removing punctuation, etc.) before feeding it into the vectorizer.

    # Finally, always make sure to evaluate your feature engineering process and the results to ensure they are meaningful and useful.
