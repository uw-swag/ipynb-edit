```python
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

    # Load your data
    df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

    # Define preprocessing steps
    preprocessor = Pipeline([
        ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
        # Add more preprocessing steps as needed
    ])

    # Apply preprocessing to your data
    df_processed = preprocessor.fit_transform(df)

    # Save the preprocessed data
    pd.DataFrame(df_processed).to_csv('preprocessed_data.csv', index=False)
    ```

    This code will load your data, apply a standard scaler to normalize the data, and then save the preprocessed data to a new CSV file. You can adjust the preprocessing steps as needed to fit your specific needs.
