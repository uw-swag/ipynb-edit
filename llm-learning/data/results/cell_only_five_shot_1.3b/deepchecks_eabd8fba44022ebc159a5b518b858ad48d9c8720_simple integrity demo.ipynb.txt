    ### Response:
    # The TV model is a type of model that is used to predict future values based on past values. It's a form of time series forecasting.

    # Here's a simple example of how you might implement a static drift in a TV model. This is a simplified example and may not be suitable for all types of time series data.

    # We'll use a simple exponential moving average (EMA) to simulate the static drift.

    import numpy as np

    # Assume we have a time series data
    time_series = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])

    # Initialize a list to store the EMA values
    ema_values = []

    # Calculate the EMA for each value in the time series
    for value in time_series:
        ema_value = (value - ema_values[-1] if ema_values else value) * 0.1 + ema_values[-1] if ema_values else value
        ema_values.append(ema_value)

    # Now we have a time series with a static drift
    drifted_time_series = time_series - ema_values

    # You can now use the drifted_time_series for your TV model

    # For example, you can use it to predict the next value in the time series
    next_value = drifted_time_series[-1] * 0.9 + drifted_time_series[-2] * 0.1

    # And so on...

    # Please note that this is a very simplified example and may not be suitable for all types of time series data.

    # Also, the EMA is a simple moving average and may not be the best method for dynamic time series forecasting.

    # In a real-world scenario, you would likely use a more sophisticated method for calculating the EMA, such as a weighted moving average or
