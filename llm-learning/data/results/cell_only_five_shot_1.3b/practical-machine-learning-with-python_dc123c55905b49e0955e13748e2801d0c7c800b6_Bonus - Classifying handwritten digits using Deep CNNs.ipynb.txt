    The code you provided is a simple example of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for the MNIST dataset. It uses the Keras library in Python, which is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.

    The code includes:

    - Importing necessary libraries
    - Defining the batch size, number of classes, and number of epochs
    - Loading the MNIST dataset
    - Reshaping the input data and normalizing it
    - Defining the model architecture
    - Compiling the model
    - Training the model
    - Evaluating the model

    The code also includes a line to visualize the model architecture using the `model_to_dot` function from the Keras utils.

    However, the code you provided is not using Git Large File Storage (LFS). Git LFS is a system for versioning large files. It's not a part of the original code you provided, but it's mentioned in the commit message.

    If you want to remove Git LFS, you can do so by following these steps:

    1. Checkout the code to a new branch: `git checkout -b new-branch`
    2. Initialize LFS: `git lfs install`
    3. Add the files to the new branch: `git add .`
    4. Commit the changes: `git commit -m "Initial commit with LFS"`
    5. Push the new branch to the remote repository: `git push origin new-branch`

    After these steps, the LFS files will be stored in the remote repository, but they will not be tracked by Git. You can still clone the repository and use Git LFS for tracking large files.

    Please note that this is a general guide and the specific steps may vary depending on the version control system and the remote repository you are using.
