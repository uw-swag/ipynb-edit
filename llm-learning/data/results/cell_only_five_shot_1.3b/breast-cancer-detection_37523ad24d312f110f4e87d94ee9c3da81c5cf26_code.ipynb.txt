```python
    from xgboost import XGBClassifier

    # Initialize XGBClassifier
    xgb_clf = XGBClassifier(use_label_encoder=False, eval_metric='mlogloss')

    # Fit the model
    xgb_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Predict the labels of the test set
    y_pred = xgb_clf.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model
    print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
    ```
    This code will implement an XGBoost classifier for improved model performance. The classifier is initialized, then the model is trained on the training data. The model's predictions are made on the test data, and the model's performance is evaluated using a classification report.
