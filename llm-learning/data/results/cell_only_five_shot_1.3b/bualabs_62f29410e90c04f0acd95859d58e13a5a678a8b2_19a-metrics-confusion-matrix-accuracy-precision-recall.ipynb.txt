```python
    # Adding links to several articles on bualabs.com
    import bs4 as bs
    import urllib.request

    source = urllib.request.urlopen('https://bualabs.com/').read()
    soup = bs.BeautifulSoup(source,'lxml')

    for paragraph in soup.find_all('p'):
        for link in paragraph.find_all('a', href=True):
            print(link['href'])
    ```
    This code will print out the URLs of all the links in the webpage.

    Please note that this code will only work if the website 'https://bualabs.com/' is publicly accessible. If it's not, you may need to use a different method to scrape the data.
