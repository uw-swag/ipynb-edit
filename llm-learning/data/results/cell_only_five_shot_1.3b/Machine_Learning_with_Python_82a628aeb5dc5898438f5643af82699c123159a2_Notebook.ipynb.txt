```python
    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

    # Create Decision Tree classifer object
    clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()

    # Train Decision Tree Classifer
    clf = clf.fit(X_train,y_train)

    # Predict the response for test dataset
    y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

    # Model Accuracy
    print("Accuracy:",metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
    ```

    This code will create a decision tree classifier and train it on the training data. It then makes predictions on the test data and prints the accuracy of the model.
