    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook that uses the Gradient Boosting Regressor model from the sklearn library to predict the 'target' column in the diabetes dataset.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The `load_diabetes` function is used to load the diabetes dataset. This dataset is a regression problem, so it's a good choice for a regression model.

    - The `train_test_split` function is used to split the dataset into a training set and a test set. The training set will be used to train the model, and the test set will be used to evaluate its performance.

    - The 'target' column in the dataset is increased by 150 to make it more realistic.

    - The `Dataset` class is used to create a custom dataset object. This class is used to encapsulate the dataset and its properties.

    - The `GradientBoostingRegressor` model is used to train the model.

    - The model's performance is evaluated using the test set.

    Please note that the code provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook, and it's written in Python. The specific libraries and functions used are not explicitly mentioned in the code.
