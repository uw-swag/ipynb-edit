    The code you provided is a part of a DeepChecks library, which is a Python library for data quality checks. The code defines a class `DatasetSizeComparison` that extends the `TrainTestBaseCheck` class. This class is used to compare the sizes of the train and test datasets.

    The `run_logic` method is where the actual comparison logic is implemented. It takes a `CheckRunContext` object as input and returns a `CheckResult` object. The `CheckResult` object contains the results of the check, which in this case is a dictionary with the sizes of the train and test datasets.

    The `display` attribute of the `CheckResult` object is a list of functions that will be called to display the results of the check. In this case, it creates a bar chart to visualize the sizes of the train and test datasets.

    The `sizes_df_for_display` variable is a pandas DataFrame that will be displayed in the notebook. It contains the sizes of the train and test datasets, and the `graph_display` function is used to create the bar chart.

    The `run_logic` method is called with a `CheckRunContext` object, which contains the train and test datasets. The method returns a `CheckResult` object, which contains the sizes of the train and test datasets and the `display` attribute, which is a list of functions that will be called to display the results of the check.
