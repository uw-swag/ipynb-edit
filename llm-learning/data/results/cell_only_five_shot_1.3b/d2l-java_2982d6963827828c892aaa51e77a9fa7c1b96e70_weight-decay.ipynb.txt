    The code you provided seems to be a part of a machine learning project. The error messages you're seeing are related to the CI (Continuous Integration) system used in the project.

    Here are some suggestions to fix the CI errors:

    1. **Check the build process:** Ensure that the build process is correctly configured and all necessary steps are executed. This includes compiling the code, running unit tests, and building the project.

    2. **Check the environment:** Ensure that the environment where the project is being built is correctly set up. This includes checking the versions of the necessary software and libraries, as well as the configuration of the build system.

    3. **Check the code:** Look for any syntax errors or logical errors in the code. Ensure that the code is correctly formatted and follows the project's coding standards.

    4. **Check the dependencies:** Ensure that all necessary dependencies are correctly installed and up-to-date. This includes checking the versions of the Python packages used in the project, as well as any other dependencies that might be required.

    5. **Check the CI system:** The CI system is responsible for automatically building and testing the project whenever changes are made. Ensure that the CI system is correctly configured and can build the project successfully.

    6. **Check the logs:** The CI system often logs the build process and any error messages that are generated during the build process. Check these logs for any errors or warnings that might indicate problems with the build process.

    7. **Check the deployment process:** If the project is a web application, ensure that the deployment process is correctly configured and can deploy the project successfully.

    8. **Check the version control:** If the project is a distributed version control system (like Git), ensure that the version control system is correctly configured and can track changes to the project.

    If you're still encountering issues after trying these suggestions, please provide more specific details about the error messages you're seeing, and I'll be happy to help further.
