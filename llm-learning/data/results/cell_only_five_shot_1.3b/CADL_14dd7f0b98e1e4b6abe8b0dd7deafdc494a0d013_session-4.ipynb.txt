```python
    # Let's explicity use the CPU, since we don't gain anything using the GPU
# when doing Deep Dream (it's only a single image, benefits come w/ many images).
device = '/cpu:0'

# We'll now explicitly create a graph
g = tf.Graph()

# And here is a context manager.  We use the python "with" notation to create a context
# and create a session that only exists within this indent,  as soon as we leave it,
# the session is automatically closed!  We also tel the session which graph to use.
# We can pass a second context after the comma,
# which we'll use to be explicit about using the CPU instead of a GPU.
with tf.Session(graph=g) as sess, g.device(device):
    
    # Now load the graph_def, which defines operations and their values into `g`
    tf.import_graph_def(net['graph_def'], name='net')

    ```
