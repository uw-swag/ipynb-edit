    The code you've provided is a series of steps to train and evaluate a model using different feature extraction methods. Here's a brief explanation of what each part of the code does:

    1. The first part imports necessary libraries and loads the dataset.

    2. The next part normalizes the text data and splits it into training and testing sets.

    3. The next part builds the BOW and TF-IDF features for the training and testing sets.

    4. The next part trains a logistic regression model on the BOW features and a logistic regression model on the TF-IDF features.

    5. The next part evaluates the performance of the models and displays the metrics.

    6. The next part builds a word2vec model and trains it on the BOW features.

    7. The next part evaluates the performance of the word2vec model and displays the metrics.

    8. The next part builds a deep neural network model and trains it on the GloVe features.

    9. The next part evaluates the performance of the deep neural network model and displays the metrics.

    The code also includes a function to generate averaged word vector features from a word2vec model. This function is used in the next two sections to generate features for the GloVe model.

    The code also includes a function to construct a deep neural network model. This function is used in the last two sections to build and train the models.

    The code also includes a function to display the performance metrics of a model.

    The code also includes a function to display the class label encoding map and the encoded labels for a given set of labels.
