    The code you've provided is used to create a 3D surface plot using Plotly, a Python graphing library. The plot is a non-convex surface plot, which means that the surface is not a straight line, but a more complex shape.

    The code is creating a 3D surface plot with the x-axis representing the first weight vector (w1), the y-axis representing the second weight vector (w2), and the z-axis representing the sum of squared errors.

    The plot is interactive, so you can zoom, pan, and hover over the plot to see the values of w1, w2, and the sum of squared errors at any point.

    The plot is created using the `go.Surface` function, which creates a surface plot. The `x`, `y`, and `z` parameters are used to define the x, y, and z coordinates of the surface plot.

    The `scene` parameter is used to set the properties of the plot, such as the title, axis labels, and the aspect ratio of the plot.

    The `fig.layout.update(scene=scene, width=700)` line is used to set the width of the plot.

    Finally, the `fig.show()` line is used to display the plot.

    This code will create a 3D surface plot with a non-convex surface, which is a more complex shape than a straight line.
