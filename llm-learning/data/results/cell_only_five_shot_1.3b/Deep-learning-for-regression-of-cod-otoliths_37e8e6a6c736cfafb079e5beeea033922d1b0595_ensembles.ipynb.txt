    The code you provided is used to generate a distribution plot of the best ensemble of models. The best ensemble is defined as the one with the highest accuracy or mean squared error.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The code first defines a string `mseStr` to store the best ensemble and its corresponding MSE.
    - It then iterates over all possible combinations of models (from 2 to the total number of models).
    - For each combination, it calculates the aggregate model and the corresponding accuracy or MSE.
    - It then identifies the best model (based on either accuracy or MSE) and stores the index of this model in `best_model_idx`.
    - It also identifies the best model (based on either accuracy or MSE) and stores the index of this model in `best_mse_idx`.
    - It then prints the number of combinations, the corresponding MSE, and the best model.
    - Finally, it prints the `mseStr`, which contains the best ensemble and its corresponding MSE.

    Please note that the code assumes that `all_cnns` is a list of all models, `y_true.age` is the true age, and `accuracy_score` and `mean_squared_error` are functions that calculate accuracy and mean squared error respectively.

    If you have any other questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.
