```python
    import nbformat as nbf

    # Load the notebook
    with open('notebook.ipynb', 'r') as f:
        nb = nbf.read(f, as_version=4)

    # Print the cells of the notebook
    for cell in nb.cells:
        if cell.cell_type == 'code':
            print(cell.source)
    ```

    This code will print the code cells of the notebook. You can modify it to show other types of cells, such as markdown or text.
