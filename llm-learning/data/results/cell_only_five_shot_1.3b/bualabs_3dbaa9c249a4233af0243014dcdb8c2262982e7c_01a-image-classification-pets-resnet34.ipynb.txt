```python
    # Import necessary libraries
    import fastbook
    from fastbook import *
    from fastai.vision.all import *
    from fastai.vision.widgets import *

    # Setup fastbook
    fastbook.setup_book()

    # Load the data
    path = untar_data(URLs.PETS)
    dogs = ImageClassifier.from_pretrained_resnet(path)

    # Create a tabular widget
    tabular_widget = widgets.Table(df, show_all=True)

    # Create a file uploader
    file_uploader = widgets.FileUpload()

    # Create a button to trigger the image classification
    btn_classify = widgets.Button(description='Classify Image')
    btn_classify.on_click(lambda x: classify_image(file_uploader.value[0]))

    # Display the widgets
    display(tabular_widget, file_uploader, btn_classify)
    ```
    This code will create a new notebook with a file uploader, a table to display the results, and a button to trigger the image classification. The image classification function will take the path of the uploaded image as input and classify it.

    Please note that you need to replace the `classify_image` function with your own implementation.

    Also, this code assumes that you have a dataset of images of dogs. You may need to adjust the code to fit your specific needs.

    The `fastbook` library is used for the notebook interface, and the `fastai` library is used for the image classification model.

    The `ImageClassifier.from_pretrained_resnet` function is used to load the pre-trained ResNet34 model for image classification.

    The `df` variable is a placeholder for the data you want to display in the table. You will need to replace it with your own data.

    The `URLs.PETS` variable is a placeholder for the URL of the dataset you are using. You will need to replace it with the actual URL.

    The `untar_data` function is used to download the dataset. You will need to replace it with your own implementation.
