    The code you've provided is a combination of data manipulation and visualization in Python using libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. 

    Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

    1. The first part of the code is creating a new dataframe `df_top10_states_consumption` that includes only the top 10 states with the highest total consumption of honey per pound. This is done by grouping the data by 'state' and summing the 'price_per_lb' for each group, sorting the results in descending order, and then selecting the top 10 states.

    2. The second part of the code is creating a boxplot to visualize the distribution of prices of honey per pound in the top 10 states.

    3. The third part of the code is creating a similar boxplot to visualize the distribution of prices of honey by year.

    The code is using seaborn, a Python data visualization library, to create the boxplots. The matplotlib library is used to display the plots.

    The final part of the code is just a summary of the results, which includes the number of top 10 states and the average price per pound for each year.

    Please note that the code assumes that the data is in a pandas DataFrame named 'data'. If your data is stored in a different format, you will need to adjust the code accordingly.
