```python
    # Importing necessary libraries
    import pandas as pd
    from scipy import stats

    # Load the dataset
    data = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

    # Perform ANOVA
    aov_result = stats.f_oneway(data['column1'], data['column2'], data['column3'])

    # Print the ANOVA result
    print('ANOVA Result:', aov_result)
    ```

    In this code, replace 'your_data.csv' with the path to your actual data file, and 'column1', 'column2', and 'column3' with the names of the columns you want to analyze. The `f_oneway` function from the `scipy.stats` module is used to perform the ANOVA.

    The ANOVA result is printed out at the end. The p-value is the significance level at which we reject the null hypothesis that all the groups have the same mean. If the p-value is less than the chosen significance level (usually 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that at least one of the groups has a significantly different mean.
