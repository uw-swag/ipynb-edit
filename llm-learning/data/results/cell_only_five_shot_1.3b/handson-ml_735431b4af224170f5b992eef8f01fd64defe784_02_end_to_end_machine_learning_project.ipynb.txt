    ### Response:
    It seems like you're trying to add a figure to a chapter in a Jupyter notebook. However, you didn't provide the context or the chapter number. 

    If you're trying to add a figure to a chapter in a Jupyter notebook, you can use the `plot` function to add a figure to a specific cell. 

    Here's an example:

    ```python
    from IPython.display import display, Image

    # Assuming you have a function that generates the figure
    fig = generate_figure()

    # Display the figure
    display(Image(filename='figure.png'))

    # Add the figure to a specific cell
    display(fig)
    ```

    In this example, `generate_figure` is a function that generates the figure you want to add. The `display` function is used to display the figure and the `Image` function is used to display the figure as an image. The `display` function is used to add the figure to a specific cell.

    Please provide more context or the chapter number so I can give you a more accurate answer.
