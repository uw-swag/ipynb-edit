    The code you provided is a set of Python scripts that are used to perform various operations on the MNIST dataset. Here's a brief overview of what each part of the code does:

    1. The first part of the code imports necessary libraries and modules.

    2. The second part of the code defines a function `plots` that takes a list of images and a boolean `interp` as input, and plots the images.

    3. The third part of the code defines a function `plot` that takes an image and a boolean `interp` as input, and plots the image.

    4. The fourth part of the code defines a list of top matrices for correlation operations.

    5. The fifth part of the code uses the `interactive` function to create an interactive widget that allows the user to zoom in on an image.

    6. The sixth part of the code uses the `correlate` function to correlate an image with a top matrix.

    7. The seventh part of the code uses the `block_reduce` function to pool the results of the correlation operations.

    8. The eighth part of the code defines a function `is8_n2` that checks if the correlation result of an image is closer to a certain filter.

    9. The ninth part of the code defines a function `is8_n1` that checks if the correlation result of an image is closer to a certain filter.

    10. The tenth part of the code defines a function `n1` that computes the sum of the absolute differences between two arrays.

    11. The eleventh part of the code defines a function `sse` that computes the sum of the squared differences between two arrays.

    12. The twelfth part of the code defines a function `pool_corr` that computes the pooled correlation result of a list of images.

    13. The thirteenth part of the code defines a function `normalize` that normalizes an array.

    14. The fourteenth part of the code defines a function `pool_corr` that computes the pooled correlation result of a list of images.

    15. The fifteenth part of the code defines a function `sse` that
