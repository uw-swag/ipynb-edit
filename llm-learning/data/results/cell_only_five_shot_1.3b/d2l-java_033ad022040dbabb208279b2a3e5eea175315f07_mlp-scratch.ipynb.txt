    # ## Build Script

    # This script is used to build the website.

    # In this script, we use the Jupyter Notebook's JSON viewer to view the notebooks.

    # ### Installation

    # You need to have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, you can install it using pip:

    # ```bash
    # pip install jupyter
    # ```

    # ### Usage

    # To use this script, navigate to the directory where your notebooks are located and run the following command:

    # ```bash
    # jupyter notebook --notebook-dir=.
    # ```

    # This will start Jupyter Notebook and open a new tab with your notebooks.

    # ### Notebooks

    # The script will view the notebooks in the current directory. If you want to view notebooks in a different directory, you can specify the path to the directory in the command:

    # ```bash
    # jupyter notebook --notebook-dir=/path/to/your/notebooks
    # ```

    # ### Known Issues

    # The script may not work correctly if the notebooks contain code that requires a specific version of Python or Jupyter Notebook.

    # ### License

    # The script is licensed under the MIT License.
