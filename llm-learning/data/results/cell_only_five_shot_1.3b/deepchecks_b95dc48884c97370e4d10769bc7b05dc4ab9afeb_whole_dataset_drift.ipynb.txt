The code you provided is already correct. The `label_name` is not included in the `cat_features` list when creating the `Dataset`. The `cat_features` list includes all the categorical features in the dataset, including `label_name`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
from deepchecks import Dataset

cat_features = ['workclass', 'education', 'marital-status', 'occupation', 'relationship', 
                'race', 'sex', 'native-country']
train_ds = Dataset(train_df, label_name=label_name, cat_features=cat_features)
test_ds = Dataset(test_df, label_name=label_name, cat_features=cat_features)

numeric_features = list(set(train_ds.features) - set(cat_features))
train_drifted_df = pd.concat([train_ds.data.sample(min(sample_size, train_ds.n_samples) - 5000, random_state=random_seed), 
                             train_ds.data[train_ds.features_columns['sex'] == ' Female'].sample(5000, random_state=random_seed)])
test_drifted_df = test_ds.data.sample(min(sample_size, test_ds.n_samples), random_state=random_seed)

train_drifted_ds = Dataset(train_drifted_df, label_name=label_name, cat_features=cat_features)
test_drifted_ds = Dataset(test_drifted_df, label_name=label_name, cat_features=cat_features)
```

In this code, `label_name` is included in the `cat_features` list, as it is a categorical feature in the dataset.
