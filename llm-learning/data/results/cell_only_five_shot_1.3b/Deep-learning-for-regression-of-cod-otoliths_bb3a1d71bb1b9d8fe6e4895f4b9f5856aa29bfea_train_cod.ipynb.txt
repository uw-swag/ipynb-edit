    # Refactoring code into folders
    # This is a general refactoring of the code into folders.
    # The folders are:
    # - data: Contains all the data related code.
    # - preprocess: Contains all the preprocessing related code.
    # - model: Contains all the model related code.
    # - utils: Contains all the utility related code.
    # - pipeline: Contains all the pipeline related code.

    # data/
    # Contains all the data related code.
    # - business.py: Contains the Business class.
    # - inspection.py: Contains the Inspection class.
    # - violation.py: Contains the Violation class.

    # preprocess/
    # Contains all the preprocessing related code.
    # - business_preprocessor.py: Contains the BusinessPreprocessor class.
    # - inspection_preprocessor.py: Contains the InspectionPreprocessor class.
    # - violation_preprocessor.py: Contains the ViolationPreprocessor class.

    # model/
    # Contains all the model related code.
    # - kmeans.py: Contains the KMeans class.
    # - sfs.py: Contains the SFS class.

    # utils/
    # Contains all the utility related code.
    # - helper.py: Contains the helper functions.

    # pipeline/
    # Contains all the pipeline related code.
    # - pipeline.py: Contains the Pipeline class.
    # - feature_engineering.py: Contains the FeatureEngineering class.

    # Refactoring code into folders is a good practice to organize the code into different modules or folders.
    # This makes the code easier to read, maintain, and test.
    # It also makes it easier to share and reuse the code.
