```python
    # Importing necessary libraries
    from google.cloud import storage
    import os

    # Initialize the Google Cloud Storage client
    storage_client = storage.Client()

    # Get the bucket where the files will be uploaded
    bucket_name = 'your-bucket-name'
    bucket = storage_client.get_bucket(bucket_name)

    # List of files to be uploaded
    file_list = ['file1.txt', 'file2.txt', 'file3.txt']

    # Upload each file
    for file_name in file_list:
        blob = bucket.blob(file_name)
        blob.upload_from_filename(file_name)

    print(f"Files uploaded to {bucket_name}.")
    ```
    Please replace 'your-bucket-name' with your actual Google Cloud Storage bucket name.

    This script will upload the files in the `file_list` to the specified Google Cloud Storage bucket.

    Please note that you need to have the necessary permissions to read and write to the bucket.

    Also, this script assumes that you have the Google Cloud SDK installed and configured on your machine.

    If you are using a different cloud storage service, you will need to replace the `storage.Client()` line with the appropriate client for your service.
