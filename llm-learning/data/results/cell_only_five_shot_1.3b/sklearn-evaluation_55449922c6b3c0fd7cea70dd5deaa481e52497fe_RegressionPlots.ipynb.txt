    # Migration of docs to jupyter-book

    # Jupyter-book is a tool for building static sites using Markdown and a modern framework called Jupyter.

    # Here are the steps to migrate your documentation to Jupyter-book:

    1. **Install Jupyter-book**:

        You can install Jupyter-book using pip:

        ```bash
        pip install jupyter-book
        ```

    2. **Create a new Jupyter-book**:

        Create a new Jupyter-book directory and initialize it:

        ```bash
        jupyter-book init my-book
        ```

    3. **Move your documentation to the new Jupyter-book directory**:

        Move your documentation files from the current directory to the `my-book` directory:

        ```bash
        mv *.md my-book/
        ```

    4. **Start the Jupyter-book server**:

        Navigate to the `my-book` directory and start the Jupyter-book server:

        ```bash
        cd my-book
        jupyter-book serve
        ```

    Now, you should be able to view your documentation in a web browser at `http://localhost:4000/my-book/`.

    Please note that this is a basic guide and might not cover all your needs. For more detailed information, refer to the [Jupyter-book documentation](https://jupyter-book.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
