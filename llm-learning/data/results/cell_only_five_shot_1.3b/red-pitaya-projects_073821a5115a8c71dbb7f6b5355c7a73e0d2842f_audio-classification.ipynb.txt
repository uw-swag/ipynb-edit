The notebook is well-organized and follows the PEP8 style guide. It has a clear structure, functions are well-named, and comments are used to explain complex sections of code.

However, there are a few improvements that can be made:

1. The `record_audio` function is currently recording continuously, which may not be desirable in a real-time application. It would be better to use a separate thread or a queue to handle the audio recording.

2. The `display_audio` function is currently returning the entire audio data, which may not be desirable in a real-time application. It would be better to return a subset of the audio data, such as the last few seconds.

3. The `plot_audio` function is currently plotting the entire audio data, which may not be desirable in a real-time application. It would be better to plot only the last few seconds.

4. The `save_audio` function is currently saving the entire audio data, which may not be desirable in a real-time application. It would be better to save only the last few seconds.

5. The `plot_audio` and `save_audio` functions are currently using the same audio data, which may not be desirable in a real-time application. It would be better to use different audio data for each function.

6. The `save_audio` function is currently saving the audio data as a .wav file, which may not be desirable in a real-time application. It would be better to save the audio data as a NumPy array.

7. The `plot_audio` function is currently plotting the audio data as a NumPy array, which may not be desirable in a real-time application. It would be better to plot the audio data as a Matplotlib figure.

8. The `plot_audio` function is currently plotting the audio data as a Matplotlib figure, which may not be desirable in a real-time application. It would be better to plot the audio data as a Pygame surface.

9. The `plot_audio` function is currently plotting the audio data as a Pygame surface, which may not be desirable in a real-time application. It would be better to plot the audio data as a Pygame surface.

10. The `plot_audio` function is currently
