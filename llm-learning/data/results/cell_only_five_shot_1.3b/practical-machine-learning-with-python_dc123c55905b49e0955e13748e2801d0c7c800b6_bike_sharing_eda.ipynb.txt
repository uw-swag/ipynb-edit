    The code you've provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and other libraries to perform data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. 

    However, it seems like you're using Git Large File Storage (LFS) for version control. Git LFS is a system for storing large files in Git, which can be a significant advantage when working with large files. 

    Git LFS is a Git extension that allows you to store large files in Git, like images, videos, and audio samples, without storing them in Git. It's a way to leverage Git's powerful capabilities for version control and collaboration.

    However, in your code, you're not using Git LFS. Git LFS is not a part of the code you've provided. 

    If you're using Git LFS, you would need to use the `git lfs` command to download the large files, and then add them to your Git repository. 

    If you're not using Git LFS, you can remove the code that uses Git LFS.

    If you're using a different version control system, the process of using Git LFS would be different. Please provide more details about your version control system so I can give a more accurate answer.
