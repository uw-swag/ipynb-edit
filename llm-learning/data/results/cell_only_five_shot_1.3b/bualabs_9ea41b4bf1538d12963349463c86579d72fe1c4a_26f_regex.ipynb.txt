```python
    import re

    str = "This is a string with a match object."
    x = re.findall("match", str)
    print(x)
    ```

    The `findall()` function returns all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of strings. The string is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order found.

    In the given code, the pattern "match" is used to find all occurrences of "match" in the string. The result is printed out.

    If you want to find the first match only, you can use the `search()` function instead of `findall()`.

    Here is the modified code:

    ```python
    import re

    str = "This is a string with a match object."
    x = re.search("match", str)
    print(x)
    ```

    This will print the match object if it exists in the string. If it doesn't, it will print `None`.
