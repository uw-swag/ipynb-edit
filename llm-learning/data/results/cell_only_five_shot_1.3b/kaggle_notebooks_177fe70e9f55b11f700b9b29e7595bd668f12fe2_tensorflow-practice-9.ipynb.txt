The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that includes several sections and cells. Here's a brief explanation of what each section or cell does:

1. **Importing necessary libraries and modules**: This section imports the necessary libraries and modules for the code to run.

2. **Defining functions**: This section defines functions for various tasks such as displaying images, preprocessing images, etc.

3. **Displaying examples**: This section uses the `display_examples` function to display a subset of the training data.

4. **Image processing**: This section uses the `bcrop`, `ccrop`, `hflip`, `vflip`, and `bright` functions to process the images.

5. **Data processing**: This section downloads and prepares the data for training and testing.

6. **Building the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: This section builds a CNN model using the `convb` function to define the layers of the model.

7. **Training the model**: This section trains the model using the training data and validation data.

8. **Plotting the history**: This section uses the `history_plot` function to plot the training and validation loss and accuracy.

9. **Displaying the reports**: This section uses the `display_reports` function to display the classification reports and confusion matrix.

10. **Final code**: This is the final section of the code where the CNN model is trained and the model's performance is evaluated.

Please note that the code you provided is a mix of Python and Jupyter notebook code, which is not a single code block. The Jupyter notebook code is divided into several sections, each of which is a code block.
