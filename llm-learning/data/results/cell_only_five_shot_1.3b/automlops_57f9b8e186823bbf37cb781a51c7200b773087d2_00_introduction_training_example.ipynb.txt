    # This is a sample code to update the cells in a Jupyter notebook.
    # The original code is not provided in the question.

    # Let's assume you have the following code in your notebook:

    # Example 1:
    # import numpy as np
    # import pandas as pd
    # from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

    # # Create a simple dataframe
    # df = pd.DataFrame({
    #     'A': np.random.rand(100),
    #     'B': np.random.rand(100),
    #     'C': np.random.rand(100),
    # })

    # # Apply KMeans clustering
    # kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
    # kmeans.fit(df)

    # # Add a new column 'Cluster' to the dataframe
    # df['Cluster'] = kmeans.labels_

    # # Now, let's move the proportion of results under the first clustering section.
    # # We will do this by grouping the dataframe by 'Cluster' and then calculating the sum of 'A'
    # # for each group.

    # # First, let's calculate the sum of 'A' for each cluster
    # sum_A = df.groupby('Cluster')['A'].sum()

    # # Then, let's calculate the proportion of the total sum of 'A' for each cluster
    # proportion = sum_A / sum_A.sum()

    # # Finally, let's add the proportion to the dataframe
    # df['Proportion'] = proportion

    # # Now, let's print the dataframe
    # print(df)

    # Example 2:
    # import numpy as np
    # import pandas as pd
    # from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

    # # Create a simple dataframe
    # df = pd.DataFrame({
    #     'A': np.random.rand(100),
    #     'B': np.random.rand(100),
    #
