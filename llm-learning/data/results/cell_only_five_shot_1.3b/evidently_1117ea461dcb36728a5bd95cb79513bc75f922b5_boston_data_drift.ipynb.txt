    The code you've provided is a part of a larger codebase and it's not clear what the purpose of this code is. It's a demonstration of how to use the evidently library to analyze and visualize data drift in a dataset.

    However, if you're looking to update the examples and tutorials, here are some general steps you could take:

    1. **Update the Examples**: This is the most important step. You need to make sure that the examples you're updating are correct and up-to-date. This includes ensuring that the code examples are clear, well-documented, and follow the same structure and format as the rest of the code.

    2. **Update the Tutorials**: If you've made changes to the code, you'll need to update the tutorials. This could involve updating the explanations in the code comments, or updating the code examples in the tutorials.

    3. **Test the Updates**: After you've made the updates, it's important to test them to ensure that they're working as expected. This could involve running the code in a controlled environment, or using a testing framework like pytest.

    4. **Document the Updates**: Finally, you should document the updates in a way that other developers can understand. This could involve creating a new tutorial, updating an existing one, or creating a new example.

    Please note that this is a general guideline and the specifics will depend on the changes you're making.
