    Here is the updated code. I have merged the data processing and the existing notebooks.

    The data processing part has been moved to the end of the code. The existing notebooks have been updated to reflect the changes.

    The existing notebooks are:
    - `scar.ipynb`
    - `scar_v2.ipynb`
    - `scar_v3.ipynb`

    The updated notebooks are:
    - `scar.ipynb`
    - `scar_v4.ipynb`
    - `scar_v5.ipynb`

    The existing notebooks are updated to reflect the changes in the data processing part.

    The data processing part of the code is:

    ```python
    from scar import load_scar

    train, valid, test = load_scar()
    from scar import C

    train_x, _, train_s = train

    x_ = []
    y_ = []
    sample_weight = []

    train_x_l, train_x_u = [], []
    for train_x_i, train_s_i in zip(train_x, train_s):
        if train_s_i == 1:
            train_x_l.append(train_x_i)
        else:
            train_x_u.append(train_x_i)

    # use labeled data as positive
    for train_x_l_i in train_x_l:
        x_.append(train_x_l_i)
        y_.append(1)
        w_p = 1 / C
        sample_weight.append(w_p)

    # use labeled data as negative
    for train_x_l_i in train_x_l:
        x_.append(train_x_l_i)
        y_.append(0)
        w_n = 1 - (1 / C)
        sample_weight.append(w_n)

    # use unlabeled data as negative
    for train_x_u_i in train_x_u:
        x_.append(train_x_u_i)
        y_.
