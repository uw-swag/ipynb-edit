```python
    import serial

    # Open serial port
    ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 9600)

    while True:
        # Read data from serial port
        data = ser.readline()
        # Convert bytes to string and print
        print(str(data, 'utf-8'))
    ```

    This code opens the serial port at the path '/dev/ttyUSB0' and sets the baud rate to 9600. It then enters a loop where it continuously reads data from the serial port and prints it.

    Please note that you need to have the correct permissions to access the serial port and the device file '/dev/ttyUSB0' should be available.

    Also, this is a simple example and might not work for your specific use case. For more complex tasks, you might need to use a different library or method.
