    ### 1. Introduction to Data Science

    Data science is a multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, algorithms, processes, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It is a key component of data engineering, which is the practice of combining data from various sources to extract knowledge and insights.

    ### 2. Data Science Tools

    Data science tools are software applications that support the development, execution, and maintenance of data science projects. Some of the most popular data science tools include:

    - **Python**: Python is the most popular language for data science due to its simplicity and the vast array of scientific and numerical libraries it provides.

    - **R**: R is another popular language for data science, particularly for statistical analysis and graphics.

    - **Jupyter Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computational environment that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

    - **Spark**: Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine for big data processing. It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R and an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs.

    - **MLflow**: MLflow is an open-source platform to manage the machine learning lifecycle. It provides a unified API for all ML workflows (including data preprocessing, model training, model selection, model evaluation, and prediction).

    ### 3. Data Science Process

    The data science process involves several steps:

    - **Data Collection**: This involves gathering data from various sources.

    - **Data Cleaning**: This involves handling missing data, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.

    - **Data Analysis**: This involves using statistical methods to understand the data and extract insights.

    - **Modeling**: This involves selecting an appropriate model for the data, training the model,
