```python
    from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
    from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

    # Define the model
    gb = GradientBoostingClassifier(random_state=0)

    # Perform cross-validation
    scores = cross_val_score(gb, X, y, cv=5)

    # Print the mean score
    print("Mean cross-validation score: %.2f" % np.mean(scores))

    # Fit the model
    gb.fit(X, y)

    # Predict the labels
    y_pred = gb.predict(X)

    # Print the accuracy
    print("Accuracy: %.2f" % accuracy_score(y, y_pred))
    ```
    This code improves the performance of the Gradient Boosting Classifier by using cross-validation to tune the hyperparameters and avoid overfitting. The mean cross-validation score is printed, which indicates the average accuracy of the model across the 5 folds. The model is then fitted to the data and the accuracy is printed.
