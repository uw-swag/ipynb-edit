```python
    import tensorflow as tf
    from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
    from tensorflow.keras.layers import SimpleRNN, Dropout, LSTM

    # Define the model
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(SimpleRNN(units=50, activation='relu', input_shape=(None, 1)))
    model.add(Dropout(0.2))
    model.add(SimpleRNN(units=50, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dropout(0.2))
    model.add(Dense(units=1))

    # Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

    # Fit the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
    ```

    ### Explanation:
    The code above defines a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model with two SimpleRNN layers. The Dropout layer is used to prevent overfitting. The final Dense layer is used to predict the output. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and the mean squared error loss function. The model is then trained on the training data using 10 epochs and a batch size of 32.

    The spelling of the code has been corrected to match the style guide. The variable names have been changed to be more descriptive and consistent with Python's naming conventions. The comments have been added to explain the code and the changes made.

    Please note that the code above is a simple example and may not work as expected. You may need to adjust the code to fit your specific needs.
