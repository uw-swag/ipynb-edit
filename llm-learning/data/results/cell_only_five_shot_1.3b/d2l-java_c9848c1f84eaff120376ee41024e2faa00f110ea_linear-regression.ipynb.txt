    ### Response:
    # Here is the function to calculate the loss. This function takes the output of the network and the true label as input and returns the loss.
    # The loss is calculated as the mean squared error between the output and the true label.

    def calculate_loss(output, label):
        return mx.ndarray.mean(mx.ndarray.square(output - label))

    # Now, you can use this function to calculate the loss in your training and validation loops.
    # For example, in the training loop:

    for data, label in training_dataloader:
        output = network(data)
        loss = calculate_loss(output, label)
        # ...

    # And in the validation loop:

    for data, label in validation_dataloader:
        output = network(data)
        val_loss = calculate_loss(output, label)
        # ...

    # The loss in the validation loop will be the same as the loss in the training loop.
    # This is because the loss function is the same in both cases.

    # The loss in the validation loop is used to monitor the performance of the network during the training process.
    # If the loss in the validation loop is lower than the loss in the training loop, this means that the network is learning well.

    # The loss in the validation loop is also used to stop the training process if the network is not improving.
    # If the loss in the validation loop is not improving, this means that the network is not learning well.

    # The loss in the validation loop is also used to save the best model during the training process.
    # If the loss in the validation loop is lower than the loss in the validation loop of the previous epoch, this means that the current model is the best one.

    # The loss in the validation loop is also used to save the model during the training process.
    # If the loss in the validation loop is lower than the loss in the validation loop of the previous epoch, this means that the
