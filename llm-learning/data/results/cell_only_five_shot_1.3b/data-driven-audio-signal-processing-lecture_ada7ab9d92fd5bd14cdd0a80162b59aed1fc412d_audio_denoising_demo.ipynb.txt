    2. Check the model: Make sure that the model you're using is appropriate for the task at hand.

    3. Check the normalization: Make sure that the normalization used is appropriate for the data.

    4. Check the loss function: Make sure that the loss function you're using is appropriate for the task at hand.

    5. Check the optimizer: Make sure that the optimizer you're using is appropriate for the task at hand.

    6. Check the callbacks: Make sure that the callbacks you're using are appropriate for the task at hand.

    7. Check the training process: Make sure that the training process is running as expected.

    If you're still having issues, please provide more specific details about the bugs or issues you're encountering.
