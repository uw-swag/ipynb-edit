    The code you've provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook, and it's written in Python. It's using a machine learning algorithm, Logistic Regression, to classify text data. The notebook is finished with the prediction accuracy of the model on the validation set.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The first part of the code is a logistic regression model trained on the training data.
    - The second part of the code is using the trained model to predict the labels of the validation data.
    - The third part of the code is calculating the accuracy of the model.

    The variables `xx`, `r`, `val_x`, `valid_labels`, and `preds` are not defined in the provided code. If you're working on this code, you would need to define these variables.

    The final part of the code is a bit unclear, but it seems to be using some kind of normalization or transformation of the data before using it in the model.

    Please provide more context or clarify what you're trying to achieve with this code.
