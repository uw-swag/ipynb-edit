    ## Lecture Material: Adding Lecture Materials as Notebooks

    ### Introduction
    In this lecture, we will be discussing the importance of notebooks in data science. Notebooks are a powerful tool for data analysis and visualization, and they are particularly useful for sharing code, data, and results.

    ### What are Notebooks?
    Notebooks are a type of file that contain a mix of text, code, and visualization. They are designed to be readable and executable, and they are often used in data science to share code, data, and results.

    ### Why Use Notebooks?
    Notebooks are widely used in data science because they allow for the sharing of code, data, and results. This makes it easy to reproduce the results of a study, as well as to compare different approaches. They also provide a platform for collaboration, as multiple people can work on the same notebook at the same time.

    ### How to Use Notebooks?
    To use notebooks in data science, you can use a variety of software, including Jupyter notebooks, Google Colab, or RStudio. The specifics of how to use each software will depend on the software you choose.

    ### Conclusion
    In this lecture, we have discussed the importance of notebooks in data science. Notebooks are a powerful tool for sharing code, data, and results, and they are particularly useful for collaborative and reproducible research.
