    The code you provided is a demonstration of how to use descriptors in the evidently library to perform various data quality checks. 

    The descriptors are used to specify the characteristics of the data that should be considered when evaluating the quality of the data. For example, the `TextLength` descriptor is used to measure the length of the text in a review, and the `TriggerWordsPresence` descriptor is used to check if certain words are present in the text.

    The descriptors are applied to the columns of the data that are being evaluated. This allows for a more granular and specific evaluation of the data, which can be useful in a variety of scenarios, such as text mining, sentiment analysis, and more.

    The descriptors are also used to create a report of the metrics that are evaluated for each column. This report can be used to visualize the results of the evaluations and to understand the impact of the descriptors on the quality of the data.

    The code also demonstrates how to use descriptors to create a dataset-level metric. This is done by creating a `Report` object and specifying the columns and descriptors that should be used. The `Report` object is then used to run the metric on the dataset, and the results are stored in a report.

    Finally, the code demonstrates how to use descriptors to create a classification-level metric. This is done by creating a `Report` object and specifying the columns and descriptors that should be used. The `Report` object is then used to run the metric on the dataset, and the results are stored in a report.

    The code is a good example of how descriptors can be used to improve the quality of the data, and they can be a powerful tool for data quality checks in machine learning and data science.
