    ### Adding notebooks

    ## Notebook 1: Random_Board
    This notebook will demonstrate the `random_board` function, which generates a random board of a given size.

    ## Notebook 2: Conflicts
    This notebook will demonstrate the `conflicts` function, which calculates the number of conflicts in a given board configuration.

    ## Notebook 3: Show_Board
    This notebook will display a board configuration using matplotlib. The board is displayed in a color-coded format, with black squares representing queens and white squares representing empty spaces.

    ## Notebook 4: Random_Board_Conflicts
    This notebook will demonstrate the use of the `random_board` and `conflicts` functions together. It will generate a random board, calculate its conflicts, and display the board.

    ## Notebook 5: Random_Board_Show_Board
    This notebook will demonstrate the use of the `random_board` and `show_board` functions together. It will generate a random board, display the board, and calculate its conflicts.

    ## Notebook 6: Random_Board_Conflicts_Show_Board
    This notebook will demonstrate the use of the `random_board`, `conflicts`, and `show_board` functions together. It will generate a random board, calculate its conflicts, display the board, and calculate the conflicts of the board.
