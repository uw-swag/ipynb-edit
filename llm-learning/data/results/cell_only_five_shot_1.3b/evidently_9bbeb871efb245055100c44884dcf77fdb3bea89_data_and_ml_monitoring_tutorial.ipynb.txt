    This code snippet shows how to upload a file to a Google Cloud Storage bucket using the `google-cloud-storage` Python client library. Replace `"my_bucket"` with the name of your Google Cloud Storage bucket, `"local/path/to/file"` with the local path to the file you want to upload, and `"storage-object-name"` with the name you want to give to the uploaded file in the Google Cloud Storage bucket.
