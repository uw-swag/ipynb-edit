    The code provided is a part of a larger DeepChecks pipeline. The pipeline is used to train a model on a dataset, validate it, and evaluate its performance.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    1. The `load_data` function is used to load the phishing dataset.

    2. The `single_dataset_integrity` function is used to create a suite of checks for the integrity of the dataset.

    3. The `get_url_preprocessor` function is used to create a pipeline for preprocessing the URLs.

    4. The `train_test_validation` function is used to create a suite of checks for training, testing, and validation.

    5. The `model_evaluation` function is used to create a suite of checks for evaluating the performance of the model.

    6. The `deepchecks.Dataset` class is used to create a dataset object.

    The pipeline is then used to train a model on the dataset, validate it, and evaluate its performance.

    The pipeline is a key part of the DeepChecks framework, which allows for a more streamlined and efficient way to perform data analysis and model evaluation.
