    ### Description:

    The code is a PyTorch implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification. The model is trained on the ImageDataBunch object, which is a PyTorch DataLoader object that is used to feed data into a model.

    The model is trained for 3 epochs using a learning rate of 0.9. After the first epoch, the learning rate is reduced to 0.000001. The model is trained for another 10 epochs with a learning rate of 0.000001. After the 10th epoch, the learning rate is reduced to 0.003. The model is trained for another 50 epochs with a learning rate of 0.003.

    The model is then evaluated on a separate validation set. The model's performance is evaluated using the accuracy metric, which is a common metric for classification problems.

    The code also includes a callback function, `ShowGraph`, which is used to display the training progress. This function is called after each epoch, and it displays the loss and accuracy of the model on the training and validation sets.

    The final model is then used to make predictions on unseen data. The model's predictions are displayed, along with the true labels.

    The code is a good example of how to use PyTorch's DataLoader and CNN to perform image classification.
