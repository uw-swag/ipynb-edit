    The code above is a simple demonstration of lemmatization and stemming using the spacy and nltk libraries in Python.

    The spacy library is a powerful library for NLP tasks, and it provides a simple and efficient API for performing tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and dependency parsing.

    The nltk library is a collection of libraries for human language processing, including tokenization, parsing, and semantic and syntactic analysis.

    The code first defines a function `print_lemma_stem` that takes a list of words as input and prints the lemmatized and stemmed version of each word.

    The function `print_lemma` is similar to `print_lemma_stem`, but it takes a sentence as input and prints the lemmatized version of each word in the sentence.

    The function `print_lemma_stem` and `print_lemma` are then called with a sample sentence.

    The code also includes a section of credits at the end, which is a simple way to include a copyright notice and a link to the original source of the code.

    Please note that you need to have the spacy and nltk libraries installed in your Python environment. You can install them using pip:

    ```
    pip install spacy nltk
    ```

    And you also need to download the necessary resources for spacy and nltk:

    ```
    python -m spacy download en
    python -m nltk.downloader punkt
    ```

    The code assumes that you have a sentence to process. If you want to process a different sentence, you can replace `'Your sentence here'` with your sentence.

    The output of the code will be the lemmatized and stemmed version of each word in the sentence, or the lemmatized version of each word in the sentence, respectively.
