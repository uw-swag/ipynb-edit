    ## Jupyter Notebook

    ## Overview
    This Jupyter notebook is designed to provide an overview of the process of data analysis and machine learning. It includes a series of code cells that outline the steps taken to preprocess the data, train a model, and evaluate the model.

    ## Code Cells

    ### Cell 1: Importing necessary libraries
    The first cell imports the necessary libraries for the analysis. These include pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computations, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization, and sklearn for machine learning.

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix
    ```

    ### Cell 2: Loading and exploring the data
    The second cell loads the data and performs an initial exploration to understand the structure and quality of the data.

    ```python
    df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
    df.head()
    ```

    ### Cell 3: Data preprocessing
    The third cell performs data preprocessing, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical variables.

    ```python
    # Data preprocessing steps go here
    ```

    ### Cell 4: Splitting the data
    The fourth cell splits the data into a training set and a test set.

    ```python
    X = df.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
    y = df['target_variable']
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    ```

    ### Cell 5: Training a model
    The fifth cell trains a logistic regression model on the training data.

    ```python
    model = LogisticRegression()
    model.fit(X_train,
