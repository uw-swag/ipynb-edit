```python
    def filter_long_words(lst, n):
        new_lst = []
        for i in range(len(lst)):
            if len(lst[i]) > n:
                new_lst.append(lst[i])
        return new_lst
    
    print(filter_long_words(["paras", "test", "amazing", "is", "cool", "iNeuron"], 4))
    ```
    This code defines a function `filter_long_words` that takes a list of words and a number `n` as input, and returns a new list that only includes the words from the input list that have a length greater than `n`. The function is then called with a list of words and a number, and the result is printed.
