    ## Adaline

    Adaline is a simple neural network model that is used for binary classification. It's a type of neural network that is used for learning from data.

    The Adaline model is a linear model, which means it's a model that can only learn from data that is linearly separable.

    The Adaline model is a good starting point for beginners in machine learning. It's simple and easy to understand, but it's not very effective for complex tasks.

    ## Code

    ```python
    from sklearn.linear_model import AdalineGD

    # Initialize Adaline
    adaline = AdalineGD()

    # Train Adaline
    adaline.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Predict
    y_pred = adaline.predict(X_test)
    ```

    ## Parameters

    - `C`: Strength of the regularization parameter.
    - `intercept_scaling`: Intercept shrinking parameter.
    - `fit_intercept`: Whether to calculate the intercept.
    - `warm_start`: When set to True, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit as initialization, otherwise, just erase the previous solution.

    ## Code

    ```python
    from sklearn.linear_model import AdalineLBFGS

    # Initialize Adaline
    adaline = AdalineLBFGS()

    # Train Adaline
    adaline.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Predict
    y_pred = adaline.predict(X_test)
    ```

    ## Parameters

    - `shrink_step`: The step size for the shrinkage process.
    - `tolerance`: Convergence criterion.
    - `max_iter`: Maximum number of iterations.

    ## Code

    ```python
    from sklearn.linear_model import AdalineSGD

    # Initialize Adaline
    adaline = AdalineSGD()

    # Train Adal
