```python
    # Assuming you have a trained model named 'model'
    # And you want to evaluate it on the test set

    # Predict the test set
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Calculate the accuracy of the model
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')

    # Calculate the F1 score of the model
    f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f'F1 Score: {f1}')

    # Plot the confusion matrix
    cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
    sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d')
    plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
    plt.show()
