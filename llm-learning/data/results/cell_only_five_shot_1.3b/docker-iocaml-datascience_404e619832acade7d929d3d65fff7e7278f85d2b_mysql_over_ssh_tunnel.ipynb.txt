    This script will open a SSH connection to your remote server, then execute a MySQL command to authenticate with the server.

    Please replace 'your_hostname', 'your_username', and 'your_password' with your actual server details.

    Also, make sure that your server's MySQL service is running and that the MySQL user you're using has the necessary permissions to connect.

    This script uses the `paramiko` library for SSH and MySQL operations. If it's not already installed, you can install it using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install paramiko
    ```

    And for MySQL, you can install it using your package manager or download it from the official MySQL website.

    Please note that this script should be run in a secure and controlled environment, as it may expose sensitive information.
