    This is a Maven configuration for the ai.djl and ai.djl.mxnet libraries. The ai.djl:api library is used for building deep learning models, and ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-engine:0.8.0 is the engine for the MXNet deep learning library. The ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-native-auto:1.7.0-backport is the native-code version of MXNet, which is used for building models in Java.

    The versions of these libraries are specified in the Maven configuration. The versions are specified as dependencies in the `pom.xml` file.
