```python
    # Import necessary libraries
    import tensorflow as tf
    import tensorflow_hub as hub
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np

    # Load the TensorFlow model
    model = hub.load("https://tfhub.dev/google/aiplatform/mnist_classification/1")

    # Test the model
    def test_model(model, test_images, test_labels):
        test_images = test_images.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1)
        test_images = test_images / 255.0

        predictions = model.predict(test_images)
        return predictions

    # Load the MNIST dataset
    (train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()

    # Test the model

    # Plot the predictions
    plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))
    for i in range(25):
        plt.subplot(5,5,i+1)
        plt.xticks([])
        plt.yticks([])
        plt.grid(False)
        plt.imshow(test_images[i].reshape(28, 28), cmap=plt.cm.binary)

    ```

    This code will load a pre-trained TensorFlow model for image classification, and then use it to classify the MNIST dataset. The model is then plotted, showing the test images along with their predicted labels.

    Please note that this code is for Android and it's not officially supported by Google Colab. It's a simple example and may not work as expected on Android.
