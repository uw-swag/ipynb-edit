    The code you've provided is a Java code snippet for a machine learning model using the Deep Java Library (DJL). DJL is a machine learning library for the JVM that provides a high-level, user-friendly API for building and training machine learning models.

    Here's a brief overview of what the code does:

    1. It imports necessary libraries and dependencies.
    2. It defines the learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size.
    3. It attaches gradients to the parameters of the model.
    4. It trains the model for a number of epochs.
    5. It calculates the error of the model's parameters.

    The `linreg` function is a simple linear regression model, `squaredLoss` is the loss function, `sgd` is the gradient descent optimizer, and `manager` is a dataset manager.

    The code is using the DJL library to train a linear regression model on a dataset. The model is trained using the gradient descent optimizer, and the loss function is the mean squared error.

    The code is also using the Tablesaw library to create a plot of the model's predictions against the actual values.

    Please note that the code is written in a JVM language and uses a specific version of the DJL library, which is 0.10.0.
