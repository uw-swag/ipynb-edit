    # Read the data from a CSV file
    df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

    # Preprocess the data (e.g., fill missing values, normalize numerical features, etc.)
    # This is a placeholder, you need to replace it with your actual preprocessing steps
    df = df.fillna(df.mean())
    df = pd.get_dummies(df)

    return df
