    The code you've provided is a list of Maven coordinates for some libraries. The "bump up version" command is used to increment the version number of these libraries.

    Here's how you can do it:

    ```bash
    %maven ai.djl:api:0.5.1
    %maven org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.27
    %maven org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:1.7.27

    %maven ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-engine:0.5.1
    %maven ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-native-auto:1.7.0-b
    ```

    In this example, the version `0.5.0` was incremented to `0.5.1` for the `ai.djl:api` and `ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-engine` libraries, and the version `1.7.0-a` was incremented to `1.7.0-b` for the `org.slf4j:slf4j-api` library.

    Please note that this is a simple example and the actual process may be more complex depending on the libraries and the versioning strategy you're using.

    Also, remember to replace the placeholders with the actual versions you want to use.
