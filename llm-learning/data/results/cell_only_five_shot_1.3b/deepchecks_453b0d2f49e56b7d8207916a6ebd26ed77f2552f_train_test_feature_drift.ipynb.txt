    This code is a simple example of a text classification model using the Naive Bayes classifier from the sklearn library. The model is trained on the 20 Newsgroups dataset, which is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned across 20 different newsgroups.

    The model is then tested on the test set and the accuracy of the model is printed.

    The model is a pipeline that first transforms the text data into a matrix of token counts using the CountVectorizer, then it transforms this count matrix into a TF-IDF representation, and finally, it trains a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier on this TF-IDF data.

    The model is then used to predict the category of the documents in the test set. The accuracy of the model is then printed.

    The accuracy of the model is a measure of how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. In this case, it's a measure of how often
