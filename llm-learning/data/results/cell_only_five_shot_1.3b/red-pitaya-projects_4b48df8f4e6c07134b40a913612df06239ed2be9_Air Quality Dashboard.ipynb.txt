```python
    import pandas as pd

    # Assuming you have a DataFrame 'df'
    df = pd.DataFrame({
        'A': [1, 2, 3],
        'B': [4, 5, 6]
    })

    # Export to CSV
    df.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)
    ```

    This code will create a CSV file named 'output.csv' in the same directory as your Python script. The DataFrame 'df' is exported to this file, with 'A' and 'B' columns. The 'index=False' argument is used to prevent pandas from writing row indices into the CSV file.
