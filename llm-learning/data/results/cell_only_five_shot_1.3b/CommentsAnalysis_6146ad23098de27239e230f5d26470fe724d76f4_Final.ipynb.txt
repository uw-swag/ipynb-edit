    The code you've provided is a function that uses various machine learning models to predict the sentiment of comments. The function `fit_predict_to_n_user` takes as input a pandas DataFrame `comments` and a list of models to use. The function then splits the data into training and testing sets, trains the models on the training set, and makes predictions on the testing set. The function also uses cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the models.

    The function uses the following models:

    1. Logistic Regression (`LrModelCount`)
    2. LSTM (`LstmModel`)
    3. MLP (`MlpModel`)
    4. XGBoost (`FeaturesModelXGB`)

    The function also uses the following models:

    1. Count Vectorizer (`LrModelCount`)
    2. TF-IDF Vectorizer (`LrModelTfidf`)

    The function also uses the following models:

    1. Variance Threshold (`SelectKBest`)
    2. Recursive Feature Elimination (`RFE`)
    3. SelectFromModel (`SelectFromModel`)

    The function also uses the following models:

    1. Gradient Boosting Classifier (`ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier`)

    The function also uses the following models:

    1. Keras (`KerasClassifier`)

    The function also uses the following models:

    1. Pandas (`pd`)
    2. Numpy (`np`)
    3. Matplotlib (`plt`)
    4. Seaborn (`sns`)
    5. Scikit-learn (`sklearn`)
    6. Gensim (`gensim`)
    7. Keras (`keras`)
    8. XGBoost (`xgboost`)

    The function also uses the following models:

    1. Count Vectorizer (`CountVectorizer`)
    2. TF-IDF Vectorizer (`TfidfVectorizer`)

    The function also
