    A DICOM file is a file format used in medical imaging to store and transport digital images. It is a binary file format that is used to store medical images. DICOM files are often used in radiology and CT scans.

    The histogram in the code is a histogram of the pixel values in the DICOM file. It is a graphical representation of the distribution of pixel values in the image. The histogram is a way to visualize the distribution of pixel values in an image.

    The `dcmread` function is used to read the DICOM file. The `show` function is used to display the image. The `pixels.freqhist_bins` function is used to generate a histogram of the pixel values.

    The `figsize=(12, 12)` argument in the `show` function is used to set the size of the figure. The `pixels.freqhist_bins` function is used to generate the histogram.
