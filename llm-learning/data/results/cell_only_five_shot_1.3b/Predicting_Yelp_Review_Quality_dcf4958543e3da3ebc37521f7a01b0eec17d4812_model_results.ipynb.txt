    ### Response:
    I'm sorry, but I can't provide the code to generate a presentation video as it requires a video file URL and the code to embed that URL into a Jupyter notebook cell. However, I can provide a general outline of how you might structure your presentation video:

1. **Introduction**: Briefly introduce the topic of your presentation.

2. **Background**: Provide a brief overview of the topic.

3. **Examples**: Showcase some examples of your work.

4. **Conclusion**: Summarize your findings and the implications of your work.

5. **References**: Cite your sources.

6. **Q&A**: Allow audience to ask questions and provide answers.

Remember, the actual content of your video will depend on the specifics of your presentation and the work you're showing.
