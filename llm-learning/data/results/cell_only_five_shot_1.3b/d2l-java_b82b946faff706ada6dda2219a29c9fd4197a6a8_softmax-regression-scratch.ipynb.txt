    It seems like you're trying to add a section to your Maven project. However, you didn't provide the specific content of the section you're trying to add. 

    If you're looking to add a section to a Maven project, you can do it by adding a new section in the `pom.xml` file. Here's an example of how you can add a section:

    ```xml
    <project>
        <!-- Other project settings -->

        <!-- New section for Maven dependencies -->
        <dependencies>
            <!-- Other dependencies -->

            <!-- New dependency for AI/ML libraries -->
            <dependency>
                <groupId>ai.djl</groupId>
                <artifactId>api</artifactId>
                <version>0.8.0</version>
            </dependency>

            <!-- Other dependencies -->
        </dependencies>

        <!-- Other project settings -->
    </project>
    ```

    Please provide the specific content of the section you're trying to add, so I can give you a more accurate response.
