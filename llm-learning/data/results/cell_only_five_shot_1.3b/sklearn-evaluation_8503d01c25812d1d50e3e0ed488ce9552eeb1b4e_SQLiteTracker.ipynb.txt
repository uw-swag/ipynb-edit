    # SQLiteTracker Tutorial
    # ---------------------
    # This tutorial will guide you through the process of using SQLiteTracker, a Python library for tracking changes in SQLite databases.
    #
    # SQLiteTracker is a simple and lightweight library that allows you to track changes in SQLite databases. It's designed to be easy to use and to be compatible with any SQLite database.
    #
    # Here's a simple example of how to use SQLiteTracker:
    #
    # 1. Install SQLiteTracker:
    #
    #   You can install SQLiteTracker using pip:
    #
    #   ```
    #   pip install SQLiteTracker
    #   ```
    #
    # 2. Import the necessary modules:
    #
    #   ```python
    #   import sqlite3
    #   from SQLiteTracker import SQLiteTracker
    #   ```
    #
    # 3. Create a connection to your SQLite database:
    #
    #   ```
    #   conn = sqlite3.connect('my_database.db')
    #   ```
    #
    # 4. Create a SQLiteTracker instance:
    #
    #   ```
    #   tracker = SQLiteTracker(conn)
    #   ```
    #
    # 5. Track changes in your database:
    #
    #   ```
    #   tracker.track_changes()
    #   ```
    #
    # 6. Access the tracked changes:
    #
    #   ```
    #   changes = tracker.get_changes()
    #   ```
    #
    # 7. Use the tracked changes as needed.
    #
    # This is a basic example, but SQLiteTracker is very flexible and can be used in a variety of ways to track changes in your SQLite databases.
    #
