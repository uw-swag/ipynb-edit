```python
    from kfp import components
    from kfp.components import InputPath, OutputPath

    AutoMLOps = components.create_component_from_func(
        train_model,
        input_component_name='input',
        output_component_name='output'
    )

    AutoMLOps.clear_cache()
    ```

    The above code snippet is an example of how to use the Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP) component system to create a new component. The `train_model` function is a placeholder for your training function. The `AutoMLOps` component is then used to train the model.

    Please replace the `train_model` function with your actual training function.

    Also, make sure to install the Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP) and its components by running `pip install kfp[all]`.

    Please note that the above code snippet is a basic example and may not work as expected without modifications.
