    # Python Notes:

    # Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is great for beginners.
    # It's used for a wide range of applications, from web and software development to data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

    # Python is widely used in the field of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
    # It's also used in web development, automation, and more.

    # Python's syntax is clean and easy to read, which makes it a great language for beginners.
    # It also has a large standard library, which makes it a versatile language.

    # Python's syntax is based on indentation, which is a common programming concept.
    # This makes it easier to understand the structure of the code.

    # Python's syntax is also known as Python 3.x, which is the latest version of Python.
    # Python 3.x is backward-compatible with Python 2.x, which means you can use Python 2.x code in Python 3.x.

    # Python's syntax is also known as PEP 8, which is the official style guide for Python code.
    # It includes rules for indentation, line length, and naming conventions.

    # Python's standard library is extensive, and it includes modules for various tasks, such as file I/O, web scraping, and more.
