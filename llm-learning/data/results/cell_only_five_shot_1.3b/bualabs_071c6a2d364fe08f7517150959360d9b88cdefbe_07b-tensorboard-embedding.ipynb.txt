```python
    # Import necessary libraries
    import tensorflow as tf
    import os

    # Create a TensorBoard callback that writes metadata to an HTML file.
    tensorboard_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir='./logs',
                                                         histogram_freq=1,
                                                         profile_batch='auto',
                                                         embed_data=True)

    # Train your model with the callback
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, callbacks=[tensorboard_callback])
    ```

    This code will create a new directory called `./logs` in your current working directory. Inside this directory, you will find a file named `index.html`. This file contains a visualization of the training process, including the loss and accuracy curves, the embedding of the training data, and the distribution of the training data.

    You can open this file in a web browser to view the visualization.

    Note: TensorBoard may not work in some environments (e.g., Jupyter notebooks).
