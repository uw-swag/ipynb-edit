    ## Evidently is a Python library for creating and analyzing dashboards for data drift and quality.

    ## Installation
    ```bash
    pip install evidently
    ```

    ## Examples
    ### Data Drift Dashboard
    ```python
    from evidently import DataDrift
    from evidently.dashboard import Dashboard
    from evidently.tabs import DataDriftTab

    # Load your data
    df1 = pd.read_csv('data1.csv')
    df2 = pd.read_csv('data2.csv')

    # Create a data drift object
