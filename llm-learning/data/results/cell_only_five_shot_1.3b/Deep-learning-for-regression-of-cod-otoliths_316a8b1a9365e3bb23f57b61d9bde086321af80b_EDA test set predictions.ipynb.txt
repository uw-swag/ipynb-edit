```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

    def plot_confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred):
        # Create a confusion matrix
        cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)

        # Create a heatmap from the confusion matrix
        sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt="d")
        plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
        plt.ylabel('Actual')
        plt.xlabel('Predicted')
        plt.show()

    # Assuming you have a trained model and a test dataset
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Convert the predictions to binary class labels
    y_pred = [1 if p > 0.5 else 0 for p in y_pred]

    # Plot the confusion matrix
    plot_confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)
    ```

    This code will create a confusion matrix and a heatmap from the confusion matrix. The confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model (or "classifier") on a set of data for which the true values are known. The confusion matrix itself is relatively simple to understand, and the interpretation of the matrix values is based on the specifics of the classification problem.
