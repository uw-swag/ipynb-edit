```python
    from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB

    # Initialize the Gaussian Naive Bayes model
    gnb = GaussianNB()

    # Fit the model
    gnb.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Predict the response for test dataset
    y_pred = gnb.predict(X_test)

    # Model Accuracy
    print("Accuracy:",metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
    ```
    This code will implement a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier on the training data, then use it to predict the labels of the test data. The accuracy of the model is then printed.
