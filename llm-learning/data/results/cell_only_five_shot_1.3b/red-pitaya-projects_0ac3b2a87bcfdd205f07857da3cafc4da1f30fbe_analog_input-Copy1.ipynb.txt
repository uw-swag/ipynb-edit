```python
    # Add Jupyter notebooks
    notebooks = [
        {
            "Category": "Data Science",
            "Repos": [
                {
                    "Title": "Notebook 1",
                    "RepoLink": "https://github.com/username/notebook1"
                },
                {
                    "Title": "Notebook 2",
                    "RepoLink": "https://github.com/username/notebook2"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "Category": "Machine Learning",
            "Repos": [
                {
                    "Title": "Notebook 3",
                    "RepoLink": "https://github.com/username/notebook3"
                },
                {
                    "Title": "Notebook 4",
                    "RepoLink": "https://github.com/username/notebook4"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]

    for n in notebooks:
        category = n['Category']
        print("# " + category)
        for r in n['Repos']:
            title = r['Title']
            repoLink = r['RepoLink']
            print(f"[{title}]({repoLink})")
    ```
    This code will add Jupyter notebooks to the repository. The notebooks are categorized under the "Data Science" and "Machine Learning" categories. Each notebook is represented as a dictionary with the keys "Title" and "RepoLink". The "Title" key is the title of the notebook, and the "RepoLink" key is the link to the GitHub repository where the notebook is located.
