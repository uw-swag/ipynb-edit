    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that includes several sections, each of which is a code cell. The first section is a code cell that loads the necessary libraries and modules. The next section is a code cell that loads the data from the specified paths. The next section is a code cell that preprocesses the data. The next section is a code cell that defines the callback functions for early stopping and model checkpointing. The next section is a code cell that resizes the images and prepares the model. The next section is a code cell that loads the pre-trained models and evaluates them. The last section is a code cell that removes the preprocessed data and resets the variables.

    The code is divided into several sections to make it easier to navigate and understand the flow of the program. Each section is a standalone code cell, and the code within each section is organized into a clear and understandable structure.
