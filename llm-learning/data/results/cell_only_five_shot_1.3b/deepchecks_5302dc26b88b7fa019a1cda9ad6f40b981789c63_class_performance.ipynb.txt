    ## Improve Wording

    The code cells in the notebook are not clear enough. Here are some suggestions to improve the wording:

    1. **Clear and concise**: The code cells should be as clear and concise as possible.
    2. **Explanation**: Include explanations of what each part of the code does.
    3. **Code examples**: Include code examples to make the code more understandable.
    4. **Code formatting**: Use consistent code formatting to make it easier to read.
    5. **Code comments**: Include comments to explain complex parts of the code.

    ### Code Examples

    Here are some examples of how to improve the code:

    1. **Gaussian Elimination**: Show how to perform Gaussian elimination without using numpy.
    2. **Gaussian Elimination with numpy**: Show how to perform Gaussian elimination using numpy.
    3. **Gaussian Elimination with scipy**: Show how to perform Gaussian elimination using scipy.
    4. **Gaussian Elimination with pandas**: Show how to perform Gaussian elimination using pandas.
    5. **Gaussian Elimination with matplotlib**: Show how to perform Gaussian elimination using matplotlib.

    ### Code Formatting

    Here are some examples of how to format the code:

    1. **Variable naming**: Use clear and descriptive variable names.
    2. **Function naming**: Use clear and descriptive function names.
    3. **Commenting**: Include comments to explain complex parts of the code.
    4. **Code indentation**: Use consistent indentation to make it easier to read.

    ### Explanation

    For each code cell, explain what the code does, what the input is, and what the output is.

    ### Refer to Other Notebooks

    If you have any other notebooks that you want to refer to, please include a link to them in the notebook.
