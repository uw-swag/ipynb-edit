    The code you provided is already formatted as plaintext JSON output. The code is written in Python and uses several libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and NumPy. The code is well-structured and follows good practices for code organization and readability.

    However, the exercise solutions for chapter 10 are not provided. If you want to add them, you can do so by creating a new Python file for each exercise and adding the solution code there.

    The code for syncing the book and notebook is already in place. The book and notebook are both Jupyter notebooks, and the code to sync them is already in the provided code cells. The notebook cells are formatted as code, and the code to sync them is already in the notebook.

    If you want to improve the code sync between the book and notebook, you can use the Jupyter magic commands like `%%javascript` or `%%python` to switch between the two. However, this will only work if the notebook is running in a Jupyter environment.
