    The code you provided is a PyTorch implementation of a binary classification task, specifically for image classification of skincancer. The code includes loading a pre-trained model, applying data augmentation, training the model, and evaluating the model's performance.

    The code also includes a function to check if a line exists in an image. This function is used to evaluate the model's performance on the 'val' dataset. The AUC score, sensitivity, and specificity are calculated and plotted to visualize the model's performance.
