The original code was trying to convert the geometry of the hospitals to a different coordinate system (epsg:2263) and then buffer the result. However, the code was not correctly converting the geometry to the correct coordinate system and was not correctly buffering the result.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# Correct the coordinate system
hospitals['geometry'] = hospitals.set_geometry('geometry', crs='EPSG:4326')

# Convert the geometry to a buffer
coverage = hospitals.geometry.buffer(10*1000)

# Correct the coordinate system
coverage = coverage.set_crs('EPSG:2263')

# Create a new map
m_3 = folium.Map(location=[40.7, -74], zoom_start=11) 

# Add the heatmap
HeatMap(data=collisions[['LATITUDE', 'LONGITUDE']], radius=12).add_to(m_3)

# Add the markers
for idx, row in hospitals.iterrows():
    Marker([row['latitude'], row['longitude']], popup=row['name']).add_to(m_3)
    
# Add the polygons
folium.GeoJson(coverage.to_crs(epsg=2263)).add_to(m_3)

# Show the map
folium.LayerControl().add_to(m_3)
embed_map(m_3, '25h-m_3.html')

# Calculate the percentage of collisions more than 10 km away from the closest hospital
percentage = round(100*len(outside_range)/len(collisions), 2)
print("Percentage of collisions more than 10 km away from the closest hospital: {}%".format(percentage))

# Proposed location of hospital 1
lat_1 = 40.6754
long_1 = -73.7498

# Proposed location of hospital 2
lat_2 = 40.6779
long_2 = -73
