The original code seems to be missing the `train` function, which is a function that is responsible for training the model. The `train` function is responsible for updating the model's parameters (weights and bias) based on the current predictions and the actual values.

Here is the `train` function:

```python
def train(X, Y, Y_pred):
    # Define the loss function
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(Y - Y_pred))

    # Define the optimizer
    optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate=0.01)

    # Define the training operation
    train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss)

    # Initialize the variables
    init = tf.global_variables_initializer()

    # Start a new TF session
    with tf.Session() as sess:
        sess.run(init)

        # Training loop
        for epoch in range(1000):
            sess.run(train_op)

        # Get the final weights
        W_val = sess.run(W)
        Y_pred_val = sess.run(Y_pred)

    # Return the final weights
    return W_val, Y_pred_val
```

The code above is a simple example of how to train a model with TensorFlow. In this example, we're using a simple linear regression model, but the general idea is the same. We define a loss function, an optimizer, and a training operation. We then run the training loop, and at the end, we get the final weights.

Please note that the `train` function is a placeholder for the actual training process. The actual training process will depend on the specific model and dataset you're using.
