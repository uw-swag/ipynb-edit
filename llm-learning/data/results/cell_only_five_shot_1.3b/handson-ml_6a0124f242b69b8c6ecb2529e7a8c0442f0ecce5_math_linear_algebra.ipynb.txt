    # Introduction to Linear Algebra

    Linear algebra is a fundamental part of mathematics, and it's a very important concept in computer science. It's a way to represent and solve systems of linear equations, and it's also a way to represent and manipulate data in a way that's easy to understand and work with.

    Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of vectors, matrices, and their properties. It's a very important concept in computer science because it's used in a lot of algorithms and calculations.

    In this notebook, we'll be discussing some of the basic concepts of linear algebra, including vectors, matrices, and their properties, and how to perform basic operations on them. We'll also be using Python to perform some of these operations.

    ## Vectors

    A vector is a list of numbers that can be added together. For example, the vector [1, 2, 3] represents a point in 3D space with the coordinates (1, 2, 3).

    ## Matrices

    A matrix is a 2D array of numbers. It's similar to a vector, but it's used to represent a system of equations. For example, the matrix [[1, 2], [3, 4]] represents a system of two equations, where the first equation is 1*x + 2*y = 3, and the second equation is 3*x + 4*y = 4.

    ## Operations on Vectors and Matrices

    We'll be discussing a few basic operations on vectors and matrices:

    - Addition: Adding two vectors together.
    - Scalar Multiplication: Multiplying a vector by a scalar.
    - Matrix Multiplication: Multiplying a matrix by a vector.
    - Transposition: Swapping the rows and columns of a matrix.

    ## Python Code

    We'll be using Python to perform these operations. Here's a simple example:

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    # Create a vector
    v = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    print(v)

    # Create a matrix
    m = np.array([[1,
