```python
    # Fix error because of bidirectional double weight size.
    # The error is due to the fact that the weight size is being calculated twice.
    # This is causing the weight size to be double, which is not correct.
    # The weight size is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared weights.
    # The weight size should be calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared weights divided by 2.
    # This is because the weight size is a measure of the importance of a feature in the model,
    # and the importance of a feature is a function of its weight size.
    # Therefore, the weight size should be divided by 2 to correct for the double weight size.

    # Fix the error in the weight size calculation
    weight_size = np.sqrt(np.sum(np.square(weights))) / 2
    ```
