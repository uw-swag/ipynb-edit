    The code you provided is a DeepChecks feature drift check. The feature drift check is a tool that helps identify and handle feature drift in your data. The check is based on the concept of feature drift, which is a phenomenon where the distribution of a feature changes over time.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The code first imports necessary libraries and sets a seed for reproducibility.
    - It then creates a training and test dataset using random numbers.
    - The training dataset has two numeric features and two categorical features. The numeric features have drift, and the categorical features do not.
    - The test dataset is created in a similar way as the training dataset.
    - The code then creates a DataFrame from the training and test datasets.
    - The DataFrame is then converted to float type for numerical features.
    - The code then creates a pipeline that includes a decision tree classifier and a column transformer. The column transformer is used to handle the categorical features.
    - The code then runs the feature drift check on the training and test datasets.
    - The code then prints the conditions that were decided for the feature drift check.

    The output of the code will be a report of the feature drift check. This report will include information about the drift, the number of features that were affected, and the conditions that were decided for the feature drift.

    Please note that the code provided is a simple example and may not work as expected in a real-world scenario. The code is based on the assumption that the drift is due to the categorical features. In a real-world scenario, the drift could be due to other features as well.
