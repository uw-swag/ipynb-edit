    This is a script for training a DenseNet161 model on the Kaggle Histopathologic Cancer Detection dataset. The model is trained for 3 epochs with a learning rate of 0.001 and a weight decay of 0.01. The model is then evaluated on the test set and the results are saved. The model is then submitted to the Kaggle competition.

    The script uses the fastai library for creating and training the model. The DenseNet161 model is used, and the training and evaluation metrics are accuracy and AUROC. The model is trained for 3 and 6 epochs respectively. The model is then evaluated on the test set and the results are saved. The model is then submitted to the Kaggle competition.

    The script also includes a callback function that saves the model after every epoch. This is useful for tracking the model's performance over time.
