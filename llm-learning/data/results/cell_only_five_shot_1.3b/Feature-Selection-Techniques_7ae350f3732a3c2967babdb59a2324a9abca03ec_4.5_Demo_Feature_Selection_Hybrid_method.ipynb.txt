The code you've provided is a Python script using the scikit-learn library to perform feature selection on a dataset using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Recursive Feature Addition (RFA). 

RFE is a feature selection method that sorts the features by their importance in the model. It starts with all features and removes the least important one until the desired number of features is reached.

RFA, on the other hand, is a feature selection method that starts with no features and adds the most important features one by one until the desired number of features is reached.

The code is divided into two parts:

1. The first part of the code imports necessary libraries and loads the breast cancer dataset. It then splits the dataset into a training set and a test set.

2. The second part of the code uses RFE to select the first 10 features from the dataset. It then uses RFA to select the remaining features.

The code also prints the selected features.

Please note that the 'feature_selection' module is not defined in the provided code. It seems like a typo or a misunderstanding. If you meant to import the 'feature_selection' module, please correct the code.
