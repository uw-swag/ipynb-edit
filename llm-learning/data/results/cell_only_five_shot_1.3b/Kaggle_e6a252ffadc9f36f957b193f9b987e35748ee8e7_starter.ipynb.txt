The code you provided is used to create a scatter map with Plotly, and it uses the Mapbox access token to display the data. The Mapbox access token is a string that you can get by creating an account on the Mapbox website.

If you want to change the Mapbox access token, you can simply replace the existing token in the code with your new token. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import plotly.plotly as py
import plotly.graph_objs as go

# Your new Mapbox access token
new_mapbox_access_token = 'your_new_token'

# Rest of the code remains the same
data = [
    go.Scattermapbox(
        lat= lat_list,
        lon= lon_list,
        mode='markers',
        marker=dict(
            size=9,
            color='rgb(255, 0, 0)',
            opacity=0.7
        ),
        text=names,
    )
]

layout = go.Layout(
    title = "Bicycle Sharing Stations in Chicago",
    autosize=True,
    hovermode='closest',
    mapbox=dict(
        accesstoken=new_mapbox_access_token,
        bearing=0,
        center=dict(
            lat=41.88,
            lon=-87.62
        ),
        pitch=0,
        zoom=11
    ),
)

fig = dict(data=data, layout=layout)
py.iplot(fig, filename='Chicago Cycle Sharing Stations')
```

Just replace `'your_new_token'` with your actual new Mapbox access token.
