```python
    with tf.Session() as sess:
        init.run()
        for epoch in range(n_epochs):
            for iteration in range(mnist.train.num_examples // batch_size):
                X_batch, y_batch = mnist.train.next_batch(batch_size)
                sess.run(training_op, feed_dict={X: X_batch, y: y_batch})
            acc_train = accuracy.eval(feed_dict={X: X_batch, y: y_batch})
            acc_test = accuracy.eval(feed_dict={X: mnist.validation.images,
                                                y: mnist.validation.labels})
            print(epoch, "Train accuracy:", acc_train, "Test accuracy:", acc_test)

        save_path = saver.save(sess, "./my_model_final.ckpt")
    ```

    In the code above, the `mnist.train.next_batch(batch_size)` function is replaced with `mnist.validation.next_batch(batch_size)`. This change is made to use the validation set for validation during the training process.
