    ## ResNet50 with Keras

    ## Description
    ResNet50 is a deep learning model that is widely used in various applications. It is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is designed to replace the previous ResNet architecture. ResNet50 is a variant of ResNet that has 50 layers, and it's often used in tasks like image classification, object detection, and more.

    ## Importing Libraries
    ```python
    import keras
    from keras.applications.resnet50 import ResNet50
    from keras.applications.resnet50 import preprocess_input, decode_predictions
    from keras.applications.resnet50 import ResNet50Weights
    from keras.preprocessing import image
    import numpy as np
    ```

    ## Loading the Model
    ```python
    model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet')
    ```

    ## Preprocessing
    ```python
    img_path = 'path_to_your_image.jpg'
    img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))
    x = image.img_to_array(img)
    x = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)
    x = preprocess_input(x)
    ```

    ## Predicting
    ```python
    preds = model.predict(x)
    print('Predicted:', decode_predictions(preds, top=3)[0])
    ```

    This notebook demonstrates how to use the ResNet50 model with Keras. The model is loaded with the 'imagenet' weights, and then the model is used to predict the top 3 most likely classes for an image.

    Please replace 'path_to_your_image.jpg' with the path to the image you want to classify.

    ## Note
    This notebook assumes that you have a working Keras installation and that you have a pre-loaded image to classify.
