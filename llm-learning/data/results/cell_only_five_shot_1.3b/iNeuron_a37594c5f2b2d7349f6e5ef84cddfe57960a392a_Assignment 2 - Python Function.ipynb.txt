    ## Assignment 2

    ### Problem Statement
    In this assignment, you will be required to perform the following tasks:

    1. **Data Preprocessing**: You will be required to preprocess the given dataset. This could involve cleaning the data, handling missing values, and converting categorical variables into numerical ones.

    2. **Feature Engineering**: You will be required to create new features that might be useful in predicting the target variable. This could involve creating new features from existing ones, or creating new features that are combinations of existing ones.

    3. **Model Training**: You will be required to train a machine learning model on the preprocessed dataset. This could involve using different types of models, and you might need to perform some hyperparameter tuning to get the best performance.

    4. **Model Evaluation**: You will be required to evaluate the performance of the model on a separate test set. This could involve using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, or other appropriate metrics depending on the problem at hand.

    5. **Model Deployment**: You will be required to deploy the trained model in a production environment. This could involve setting up a server, or using a cloud service.

    ### Submission
    Your submission should include the following:

    - The Python code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, model evaluation, and model deployment.
    - A report or presentation that summarizes the process, the decisions made during the process, and the results of the model.
    - A Python script that can be used to reproduce the results of the model.

    ### Evaluation
    The assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

    - Code quality and readability.
    - Correctness of the solution.
    - The accuracy of the model.
    - The efficiency of the model.
    - The quality of the report or presentation.

    ### Deadline
    The assignment will be due on the due date specified in the assignment description.
