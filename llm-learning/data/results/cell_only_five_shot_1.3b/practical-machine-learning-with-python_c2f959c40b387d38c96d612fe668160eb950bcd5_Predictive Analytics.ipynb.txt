    # Removing Git LFS
    git filter-branch --tree-filter 'git rm -rf --ignore-unmatch .git/lfs' HEAD
    ```

    This command will remove all the large files (LFS) that are not being tracked by Git. However, it will also remove the commits that are using these large files.

    Please note that this is a destructive operation and it will permanently remove all the large files and their commits. It's recommended to backup your repository before running this command.
