    2. **Quality Assurance:** Without proper documentation, the code can be difficult to review and test.
    3. **Collaboration:** Without proper documentation, it can be difficult for other developers to understand the code and contribute to it.

    ## 2.7.4: General Structure

    A general structure for documentation can be as follows:

    1. **Introduction:** Brief introduction about the document.
    2. **Objective:** The main objective of the document.
    3. **Background:** Background information about the code.
    4. **Methodology:** The methodology used to create the document.
    5. **Procedure:** The steps to create the document.
    6. **Results:** The results of the document.
    7. **Conclusion:** A summary of the document.
