```
    from deepchecks.tabular.checks import StringMismatchComparison
    import pandas as pd

    data = {'col1': ['Deep', 'deep', 'deep!!!', 'earth', 'foo', 'bar', 'foo?']}
    compared_data = {'col1': ['Deep', 'deep', '$deeP$', 'earth', 'foo', 'bar', 'foo?', '?deep']}

    StringMismatchComparison().run(pd.DataFrame(data=data), pd.DataFrame(data=compared_data))
    ```
    The code above is used to compare two columns in a DataFrame. The `StringMismatchComparison` check is used to find the differences between the two columns. The `run` method is used to execute the check and return the result.

    Please note that the `StringMismatchComparison` check is not available in the DeepChecks library. You may need to implement it yourself or use a different check that is available in the DeepChecks library.
