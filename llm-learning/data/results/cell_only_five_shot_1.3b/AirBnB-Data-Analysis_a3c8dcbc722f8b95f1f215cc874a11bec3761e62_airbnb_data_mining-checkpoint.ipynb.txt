    Your code seems to be mostly well-structured and well-commented, but there are a few areas that could be improved for better readability and maintainability. Here are some suggestions:

    1. Use meaningful variable names: In your code, the variable names `df`, `neighs`, `reviews`, `prices`, `wordcloud`, and `df['info']` are quite generic. It would be better to use more descriptive names.

    2. Add docstrings: Docstrings are a good practice in Python to provide a description of what a function, method, or class does. They can be used to generate API documentation.

    3. Use meaningful constants: In your code, the constant `DEFAULT_SEED` is defined but not used anywhere in the code. It might be better to define a meaningful constant for it.

    4. Use meaningful exception handling: In your code, the exception handling is quite basic. It would be better to use more specific exceptions and handle them properly.

    5. Use meaningful comments: In your code, the comments are not very descriptive. They could be better to be more specific and to be more detailed.

    6. Use meaningful function names: In your code, the function names `preprocess_text` are quite generic. It would be better to use more descriptive names.

    7. Use meaningful variable types: In your code, the variable types are not very descriptive. It would be better to use more descriptive variable types.

    8. Use meaningful loops: In your code, the loops are not very descriptive. They could be better to be more specific and to be more detailed.

    9. Use meaningful imports: In your code, the imports are not very descriptive. They could be better to be more specific and to be more detailed.

    10. Use meaningful dataframes: In your code, the dataframes are not very descriptive. They could be better to be more specific and to be more detailed.

    11. Use meaningful data types: In your code, the data types are not very descriptive. It would be better to use more descriptive data types.

    12. Use meaningful data manipulation functions: In your code, the data manipulation functions are not very descriptive. They could be better to be more
