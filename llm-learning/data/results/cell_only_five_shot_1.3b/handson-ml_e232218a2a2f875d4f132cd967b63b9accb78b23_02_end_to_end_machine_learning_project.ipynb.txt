    The code you provided is using a function transformer instead of a class. The function transformer is a type of transformer that applies a function to the data. In this case, the function is the `CombinedAttributesAdder` class.

    The `CombinedAttributesAdder` class is a transformer that combines the features of the data into a new feature. The new features are created by adding the bedrooms per room feature to the existing features.

    The `Pipeline` class is used to chain the transformations. The `Pipeline` class is a transformer that chains a sequence of transformers and a final estimator. The sequence of transformers is applied in the order they are specified, and the final estimator is used to make final predictions.

    The `Pipeline` class is a convenient way to apply a sequence of data processing steps to a dataset. It allows you to apply the same transformation to the whole dataset, and it also provides a simple way to save and load the pipeline.

    Here is the updated code:
