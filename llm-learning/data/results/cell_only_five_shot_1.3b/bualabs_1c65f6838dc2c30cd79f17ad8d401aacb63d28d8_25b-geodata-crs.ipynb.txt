    ### Response:
    It seems like you're trying to draft a code cell, but you didn't provide any code. However, I can provide you with a general example of how to use the Geopandas library in Python to manipulate geospatial data.

    Here's a simple example:

    ```python
    import geopandas as gpd

    # Load a GeoDataFrame
    gdf = gpd.read_file(path_to_shapefile)

    # Print the first 5 rows of the GeoDataFrame
    print(gdf.head())

    # Filter the GeoDataFrame to only include rows where 'column_name' is 'value'
    filtered_gdf = gdf[gdf['column_name'] == 'value']

    # Save the filtered GeoDataFrame to a new shapefile
    filtered_gdf.to_file(path_to_new_shapefile)
    ```

    Please replace `path_to_shapefile`, `column_name`, and `value` with your actual file paths and values.

    If you need more specific help, please provide more details about the task you're trying to accomplish.
