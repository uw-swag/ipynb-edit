    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub to preprocess and train a model for image classification. The notebook includes the following steps:

1. It imports necessary libraries and modules.
2. It loads the dataset and preprocesses the images.
3. It resizes the images and converts the labels to categorical.
4. It splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
5. It defines a function to preprocess the images and labels.
6. It defines a function to build a model using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub.
7. It trains the model on the training set and evaluates it on the testing set.
8. It repeats the process for a different model and dataset.

The notebook also includes the following cells:

- The first cell imports the necessary libraries and modules.
- The second cell defines the function `prepro_resize_display`.
- The third cell loads the dataset and preprocesses the images.
- The fourth cell resizes the images and converts the labels to categorical.
- The fifth cell splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
- The sixth cell defines a function to preprocess the images and labels.
- The seventh cell defines a function to build a model using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub.
- The eighth cell trains the model on the training set and evaluates it on the testing set.
- The ninth cell repeats the process for a different model and dataset.
