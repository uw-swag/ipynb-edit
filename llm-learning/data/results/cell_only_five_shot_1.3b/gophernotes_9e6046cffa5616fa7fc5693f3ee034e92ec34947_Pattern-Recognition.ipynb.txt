    ]

    ### Response:
    The Dockerfile you provided is already set up to build a Docker image for a Python application. The Dockerfile uses the official Python image as a base, sets the working directory to /app, adds the current directory contents to the image, installs any dependencies specified in requirements.txt, exposes port 80, and finally runs the app.py command when the container launches.

    However, if you want to add a new Python package or dependency to the Docker image, you can do so by adding it to the requirements.txt file and then updating the Dockerfile to install the new package. For example, if you want to add the scikit-learn package, you would add it to the requirements.txt file like this:

    ```
    scikit-learn
    ```

    Then, you would update the Dockerfile to install the new package like this:

    ```Dockerfile
    # Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
    FROM python:3.7-slim

    # Set the working directory in the container to /app
    WORKDIR /app

    # Add the current directory contents into the container at /app
    ADD . /app

    # Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

    # Install scikit-learn
    RUN pip install scikit-learn

    # Make port
