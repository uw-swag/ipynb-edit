    This section is about the use of Sequence to Sequence (seq2seq) learning in deep learning. Seq2seq is a type of machine learning model that is used for tasks that involve translating one sequence of input data into another sequence of output data.

    Here is a brief explanation of the code cells:

    - The first line is a Maven repository configuration. It specifies the Maven repository URL and the snapshot repository.

    - The next lines are the dependencies for the SLF4J API, SLF4J Simple, and JNA libraries. These are used for logging and handling non-Java objects.

    - The next lines are the dependencies for the Deep Java Library (DJL) API and its basic dataset. DJL is a library for developing deep learning models in Java.

    - The next lines are the dependencies for the MXNet engine and its native auto build. MXNet is a deep learning framework that supports a wide range of neural network architectures.

    Please note that the versions of the dependencies are specified as snapshots, which means they are not guaranteed to be stable or reliable. Always use the latest stable version of the libraries when possible.

    The last section is a placeholder for the actual code that uses the seq2seq learning model.

    Please replace the placeholder with the actual code that uses the seq2seq learning model.
