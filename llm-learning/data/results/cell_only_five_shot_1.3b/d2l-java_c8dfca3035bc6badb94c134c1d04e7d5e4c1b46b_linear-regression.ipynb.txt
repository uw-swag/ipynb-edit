    The code you provided is a simple Java program that uses the Maven build tool to manage dependencies and perform some operations. Here's a brief explanation of the changes:

    1. The `Timer` class has been renamed to `StopWatch`. This is a common convention in Java for naming classes that perform time-tracking operations.

    2. The `start()` method in the `Timer` class has been renamed to `begin()`. This is a common convention in Java for starting a timer.

    3. The `stop()` method in the `Timer` class has been renamed to `stop()`. This is a common convention in Java for stopping a timer.

    4. The `avg()` method in the `Timer` class has been renamed to `average()`. This is a common convention in Java for calculating the average of a set of values.

    5. The `sum()` method in the `Timer` class has been renamed to `total()`. This is a common convention in Java for calculating the sum of a set of values.

    6. The `cumsum()` method in the `Timer` class has been renamed to `cumulativeSum()`. This is a common convention in Java for calculating the cumulative sum of a set of values.

    7. The `nanoToSec()` method in the `Timer` class has been renamed to `convertNanoToSec()`. This is a common convention in Java for converting a time in nanoseconds to seconds.

    8. The `Timer` class has been imported from the `ai.djl` package. This is a common convention in Java for importing classes from a specific package.

    9. The `Timer` class has been used to measure the time taken for operations in the code.

    10. The `IntStream` has been used to generate a sequence of numbers.

    11. The `String.format()` method has been used to format the output of the code.

    12. The `Timer` class has been used to measure the time taken for operations in the code.

    13. The `import java.util.stream.IntStream;` statement has been used to import the `IntStream`
