    ### Response:
    The code you provided is a Python script that uses the Boto3 library to download a file from an Amazon S3 bucket. The script is designed to run on a server, specifically on the Ferguson event.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The `boto3` library is used to interact with Amazon S3.
    - The `get_s3_file` function is defined to download a file from an S3 bucket.
    - The function takes two parameters: the name of the bucket and the name of the file to download.
    - The function attempts to download the file from the S3 bucket.
    - If the file is successfully downloaded, it prints a success message and returns True.
    - If the file cannot be found, it prints a failure message and returns False.
    - If credentials are not available, it prints a failure message and returns False.
    - Finally, the function is called with the name of the bucket and the name of the file to download, and the result is printed.

    This script can be run on a server, specifically on the Ferguson event, to download a file from an Amazon S3 bucket.
