    The code you provided is a part of the DL4J (Deep Learning for Java) library, which is used for developing and deploying machine learning applications.

    The commit message "Upgrade to djl 0.13.0 (#176)" indicates that the DL4J library has been updated to version 0.13.0. This version includes several improvements and bug fixes.

    Here's a brief explanation of the changes:

    - The `tryGpu` method now takes an integer `i` as an argument, and returns the `i`-th GPU if it exists, otherwise it returns the CPU.
    - The `tryAllGpus` method now returns an array of all available GPUs, or the CPU if no GPUs are available.

    Please note that the actual changes in the code will depend on the specific changes made in the 0.13.0 version of the DL4J library.

    If you're using this code in a DL4J-based application, you should update your code to use the new methods as per the version of the DL4J library you're using.

    If you're not using DL4J, you can ignore this commit.
