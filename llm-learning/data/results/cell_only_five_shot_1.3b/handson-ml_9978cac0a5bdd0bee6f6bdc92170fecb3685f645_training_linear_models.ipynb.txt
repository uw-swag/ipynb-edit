    The code you provided is importing the necessary libraries for the project. The libraries include:

    - `os`: This is a built-in Python library that provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality.
    - `numpy`: This is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
    - `numpy.random`: This module provides functions for generating random numbers.
    - `sklearn`: This is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms.
    - `matplotlib`: This is a plotting library for the Python programming language. It provides two-dimensional drawing facilities for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

    The code also defines a function `save_fig` that saves the current figure to a file. This function is used to save the figures in the "images" directory of the project.

    The `os` library is used to get the current working directory, which is used to create the path to the image file.

    The `numpy` and `numpy.random` libraries are used to generate random numbers, and the `sklearn` library is used to train a linear regression model.

    The `matplotlib` library is used to create the plots.
