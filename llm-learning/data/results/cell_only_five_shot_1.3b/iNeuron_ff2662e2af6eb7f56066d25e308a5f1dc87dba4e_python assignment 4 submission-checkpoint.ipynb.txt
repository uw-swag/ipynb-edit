    The code you provided is a Python program that prompts the user for the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and then calculates the area of a triangle if the triangle is valid. If the triangle is not valid, it prints a message to the user.

    Here's the updated code:

    ```python
    class Triangle:   
        def __init__(self):
            a = int(input("Side 1: "))
            b = int(input("Side 2: "))
            c = int(input("Side 3: "))
            
            if a+b>c and b+c>a and a+c>b:
                t = TriangleArea()
                print("Area of Triangle = "+str(t.find_area(a, b, c)))
            else:
                print("Not a valid Triangle!")
            
    class TriangleArea:    
        def find_area(self, a, b, c):
            s = (a+b+c)/2
            return (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))**0.5

    Triangle()
    ```

    In this updated code, the `Triangle` class is defined with a method `__init__` that prompts the user for the lengths of the sides of a triangle. If the triangle is valid (i.e., the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side), it creates an instance of the `TriangleArea` class and calculates the area of the triangle. If the triangle is not valid, it prints a message to the user.
