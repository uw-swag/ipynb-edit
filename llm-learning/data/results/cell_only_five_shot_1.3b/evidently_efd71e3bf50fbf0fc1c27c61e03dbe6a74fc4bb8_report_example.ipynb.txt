    Original Code Cells:
    '''
    def mean(numbers):
        return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    '''
    ]

    ### Response:
    The function `mean` is implemented to calculate the mean of a list of numbers. It takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean of these numbers. The mean is calculated by summing up all the numbers in the list and then dividing by the number of elements in the list.

    Here is the Python code:

    ```python
    def mean(numbers):
        return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    ```

    This function works by first summing up all the numbers in the list using the `sum` function, and then dividing this sum by the number of elements in the list, which is obtained using the `len` function.

    The function can be used like this:

    ```python
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    mean_value = mean(numbers)
    print(mean_value)  # Output: 3.0
    ```

    This will print the mean of the numbers in the list.
