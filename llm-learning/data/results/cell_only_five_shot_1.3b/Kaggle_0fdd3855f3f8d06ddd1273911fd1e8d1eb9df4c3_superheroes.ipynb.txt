    The issue with the code is that it seems like the `venn3` function is not defined in the code. The `venn3` function is used to create a Venn diagram, which is a visual representation of the relationship between three or more sets. 

    However, the code you provided is not complete and does not seem to be related to the `venn3` function. It seems like you are trying to create a Venn diagram for three different sets: `vision_heroes`, `reality_dist_heroes`, `strength_heroes`, `reality_dist_heroes`, `strength_heroes`, and `thermal_heroes`.

    If you want to create a Venn diagram, you should use the `matplotlib.pyplot.figure` function to create a new figure, and then use the `venn3` function to create the Venn diagram.

    Here is a corrected version of your code:

    ```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Assuming you have defined your sets
    vision_heroes = ...
    reality_dist_heroes = ...
    strength_heroes = ...
    reality_dist_heroes = ...
    strength_heroes = ...
    thermal_heroes = ...

    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
    venn3([vision_heroes, reality_dist_heroes, strength_heroes], ('Vision', 'Reality Distortion', 'Strength'))
    plt.show()
    ```

    Please replace the `...` with your actual data.

    If you want to create a Venn diagram for multiple sets, you can use the `venn3` function multiple times, each time with a different set.

    If you want to create a Venn diagram for a specific set, you can use the `venn3` function with a single set.

    If you want to create a Venn diagram for sets that are subsets of each other, you can use the `venn3` function with a list of sets.

    If you want to create a Venn diagram for sets that are not subsets of each other, you can use the `ven
