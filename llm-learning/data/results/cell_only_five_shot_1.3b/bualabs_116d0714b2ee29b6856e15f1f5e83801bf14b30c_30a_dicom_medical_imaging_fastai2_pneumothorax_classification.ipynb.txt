    The original code is using a focal loss function with a gamma of 2.0. To adjust the gamma to 4.0, you need to change the line where the loss function is created.

    Here is the adjusted code:

    ```python
    loss_func = XFocalLoss(alpha=1.0, gamma=4.0, reduction='mean')
    ```

    This will create a focal loss function with a gamma of 4.0.
