```
    # Create a Dockerfile
    FROM python:3.7-slim

    WORKDIR /app

    # Install dependencies
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir pandas cudf requests

    # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
    COPY . /app

    # Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
    EXPOSE 80

    # Run app.py when the container launches
    CMD ["python", "app.py"]
    ```

    This Dockerfile creates a Docker image that uses Python 3.7 and installs the necessary dependencies. It then copies the current directory contents into the Docker image at /app. The EXPOSE instruction makes port 80 available to the outside world. The CMD instruction specifies the command to run when a container is started from this image.

    The Dockerfile is then used to build a Docker image and run a container from it. The container runs the Python script `app.py`, which is the script you've provided.

    Please note that the Dockerfile assumes that the Python script `app.py` is in the same directory as the Dockerfile. If it's in a different location, you'll need to adjust the COPY command accordingly.

    Also, the Dockerfile is using a slim base image (`python:3.7-slim`) to save space. If you want to use a full Python image, you can replace `python:3.7-slim` with `python:3.7`.

    Finally, the `%%time` magic command is used to time the execution of the code. This is a Jupyter magic command that measures the execution time of the code block.

    The `requests` library is used to download the tips dataset from a URL, and `cudf` is used to perform computations on the GPU.

    The code reads the CSV file, calculates the tip percentage, and then prints the average tip percentage by dining party size.

    Please note that the code assumes that the CSV file is in the same directory as the Dockerfile. If it's in a different location, you'll need to adjust the COP
