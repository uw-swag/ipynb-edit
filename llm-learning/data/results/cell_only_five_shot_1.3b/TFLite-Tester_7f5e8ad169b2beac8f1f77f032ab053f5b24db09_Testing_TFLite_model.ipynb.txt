    The code you provided is for a TensorFlow 2.0 notebook. The first cell installs the TensorFlow 2.0 version and the second cell uses TensorFlow Hub to load a pre-trained model for image classification.

    The TensorFlow 2.0 version is stable and recommended for most of the modern machine learning applications. The TensorFlow Hub library is a collection of pre-trained models, which can be used directly in TensorFlow applications.

    The code in the second cell is for loading a pre-trained model and making predictions on a validation dataset. The predictions are then converted to a Pandas DataFrame for better visualization.

    However, the code you provided is not complete. It seems like you're trying to load a pre-trained model from TensorFlow Hub, but you're not providing the correct model name. The model name should be the name of the model you want to load, not the URL.

    Here's the complete code:

    ```python
    !pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0-beta0
    !pip install tensorflow_hub
    import tensorflow as tf
    import tensorflow_hub as hub
    import pandas as pd

    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
      hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2-preview/mobilenet_v2/feature_vector/4", 
                     output_shape=[1280],
                     trainable=False),
      tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.4),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(train_generator.num_classes, activation='softmax')
    ])

    model.build([None, 224, 224, 3])

    model.summary()

    FLOWERS_SAVED_MODEL = "saved_models/flowers"
    tf.keras.experimental.export_saved_model(model, FLOWERS_SAVED_MODEL)

    # Load SavedModel
    flowers_model = tf.keras.experimental.load_
