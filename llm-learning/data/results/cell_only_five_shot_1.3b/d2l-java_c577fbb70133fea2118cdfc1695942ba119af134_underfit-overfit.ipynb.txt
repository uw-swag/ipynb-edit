    The code you've provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the Deep Learning library, Djl, to train a model to predict the number of airline passengers over time. The model is trained using a polynomial regression technique, and the results are visualized using a line plot.

    The code is divided into several sections:

    1. The import statements and the utility functions are defined.
    2. The training and test datasets are created.
    3. The model is trained using the training data.
    4. The model's parameters are retrieved and displayed.
    5. The model's performance is evaluated on the test data.
    6. The model's performance is visualized using a line plot.

    The code is divided into four parts:

    - The first part imports the necessary libraries and the utility functions.
    - The second part creates the training and test datasets.
    - The third part trains the model using the training data.
    - The fourth part retrieves the model's parameters and displays them.
    - The fifth part evaluates the model's performance on the test data.
    - The last part visualizes the model's performance.
