```python
    import plotly.graph_objects as go

    fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Scatter(x=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], y=[1, 3, 2, 4, 3])])
    fig.show()
    ```
    This code will create a scatter plot with the data points (x, y) specified in the list comprehensions. The `fig.show()` command will display the plot in a new window.

    The commit message "Fixing plotly rendering in docs (#305)" is a description of the changes made to the code. The number (#305) is a unique identifier for the commit, which is used to track changes and manage issues.

    The original code is not provided in the question, so I can't provide a more detailed explanation of the changes made. However, the code provided should work as expected.
