The numerical stability section refers to the property of a computer program that ensures that the results of a computation remain within a specified range, even when the input values are very close to each other. This is important in deep learning and machine learning, where the values can be very close to each other.

The change in sample data is to use a different set of data for training and testing. The original data was used for training and testing, but the data was not representative of the real-world scenario. The new data, which is a different set of data, is used for training and testing. This change is to ensure that the model is not just memorizing the training data, but is able to generalize to new, unseen data.

Here is the updated code:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
import torch.optim as optim

# Define the model
class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(5, 3)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return F.log_softmax(x, dim=1)

# Initialize the model
model = Net()

# Define the loss function and the optimizer
criterion = nn.NLLLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Load the new data
# Assuming new_data is a tensor of shape (100, 10)
new_data = torch.randn(100, 10) * 10

# Forward pass through the model
output = model(new_data)

# Compute the loss
loss = criterion(output, torch.randint(0, 3, (100,)))

# Backward pass and optimization
optimizer.zero_grad()
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
```

In this code, the
