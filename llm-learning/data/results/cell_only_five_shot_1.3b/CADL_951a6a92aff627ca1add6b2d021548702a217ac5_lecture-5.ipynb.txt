```python
    # Importing necessary libraries
    import tensorflow as tf

    # Defining the number of cells and layers
    n_cells = 128
    n_layers = 2

    # Defining the input sequence
    X = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], dtype=tf.float32)

    # Creating the RNN cell
    cells = tf.nn.rnn_cell.BasicLSTMCell(num_units=n_cells, state_is_tuple=True)
    if n_layers > 1:
        cells = tf.nn.rnn_cell.MultiRNNCell(
            [cells] * n_layers, state_is_tuple=True)
    initial_state = cells.zero_state(tf.shape(X)[0], tf.float32)

    # This will return us a list of outputs of every element in our sequence.
    # Each output is `batch_size` x `n_cells` of output.
    # It will also return the state as a tuple of the n_cells's memory and
    # their output to connect to the time we use the recurrent layer.
    outputs, state = tf.nn.rnn(cells, Xs, initial_state=initial_state)

    # We'll now stack all our outputs for every cell
    outputs_flat = tf.reshape(tf.concat(1, outputs), [-1, n_cells])
    ```

    This code is a TensorFlow implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using the LSTM cell. The RNN is trained to predict the next element in the sequence. The code is also formatted to follow PEP8 style guide.
