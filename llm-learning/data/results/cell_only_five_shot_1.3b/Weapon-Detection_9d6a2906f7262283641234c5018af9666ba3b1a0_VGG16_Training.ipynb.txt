    # You can add files via upload in Jupyter notebook by using the following code.
    # This code will allow you to upload a file and then display it.

    from IPython.display import FileUpload
    upload = FileUpload()
    display(upload)

    # After uploading the file, you can use the following code to display the file.
    # This code will display the file as a dataframe.

    import pandas as pd
    uploaded_data = pd.read_csv(upload.value[0])
    display(uploaded_data.head())

    # You can also use the following code to display the file as a plot.
    # This code will display the file as a plot.

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.plot(uploaded_data)
    plt.show()

    # You can also use the following code to display the file as a table.
    # This code will display the file as a table.

    from IPython.display import display
    display(uploaded_data)

    # You can also use the following code to display the file as a chart.
    # This code will display the file as a chart.

    import plotly.express as px
    px.line(uploaded_data)
    px.show()

    # You can also use the following code to display the file as a map.
    # This code will display the file as a map.

    import geopandas as gpd
    gpd.read_file(upload.value[0])
    gpd.plotting.plot_geopandas_object(gpd.read_file(upload.value[0]))

Please note that the above code is a basic example and may not work for all types of files. The code will only work for files that can be read by pandas, matplotlib, plotly, and geopandas.
