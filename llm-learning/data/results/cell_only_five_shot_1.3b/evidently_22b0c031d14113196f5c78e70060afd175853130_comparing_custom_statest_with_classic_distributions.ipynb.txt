The code you provided is a part of a larger codebase and it seems to be related to data drift testing. The presets and data drift parameters are being updated.

Here's a brief explanation of what the code does:

1. It defines several statistical tests to be used for data drift testing.
2. It creates a `TestSuite` object, which is a collection of tests.
3. It creates five `TestColumnValueDrift` objects, each with a different statistical test and a specific column name.
4. The `TestSuite` object is then used to run the tests on a specific column (`feature`) in a dataset.

The code seems to be part of a larger system that is used for detecting and handling data drift in a data pipeline. The presets and data drift parameters are updated to reflect the results of these tests.

Please note that the code is written in Python and uses the `pandas` and `data-pipeline` libraries.
