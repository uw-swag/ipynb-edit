    # Mathematical concepts and definitions:

    # 1. **Definition of a function**: A function is a reusable piece of code that performs a specific task.

    # 2. **Definition of a variable**: A variable is a storage location that can hold a value.

    # 3. **Definition of a loop**: A loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly.

    # 4. **Definition of a conditional statement**: A conditional statement is used to decide the flow of the program based on a condition.

    # 5. **Definition of a class**: A class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

    # 6. **Definition of a module**: A module is a file containing a set of functions and definitions, which can be imported into other modules.

    # 7. **Definition of a namespace**: A namespace is a scope in the program where variables and functions are not visible outside the scope.

    # 8. **Definition of a package**: A package is a collection of related modules, classes, and functions.

    # 9. **Definition of a program**: A program is an executable file that is run by the computer's operating system.

    # 10. **Definition of a script**: A script is a file containing a sequence of commands written in a special instruction language.

    # 11. **Definition of a string**: A string is a sequence of characters.

    # 12. **Definition of a tuple**: A tuple is a collection of objects which are ordered and immutable.

    # 13. **Definition of a type**: A type is a class of objects.

    # 14. **Definition of a variable**: A variable is a storage location that can hold a value.

    # 15. **Definition of a while loop**: A while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true.

    # 16. **Definition of a for loop**: A for loop is
