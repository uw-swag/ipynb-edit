```python
    # top k items to recommend
    TOP_K = 10

    # Select MovieLens data size: 100k, 1m, 10m, or 20m
    MOVIELENS_DATA_SIZE = '100k'

    # SOF-6654: move some examples to the `other` folder with their assets
    # For example, if you have a file named `example.py` in the current directory,
    # you can move it to the `other` directory like this:
    # os.rename('example.py', 'other/example.py')

    # You can also move multiple files at once, for example:
    # os.rename('file1.py', 'other/file1.py')
    # os.rename('file2.py', 'other/file2.py')

    # Please note that the `os.rename()` function is used to rename files.
    # If you want to move files, you should use the `shutil.move()` function instead.

    # For more information, please refer to the Python documentation:
    # https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.rename
    # https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.move
