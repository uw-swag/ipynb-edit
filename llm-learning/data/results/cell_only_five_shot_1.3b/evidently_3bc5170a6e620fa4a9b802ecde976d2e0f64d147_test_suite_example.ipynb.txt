    ```

    The code above is a sample code snippet for using the Evidently library to create a test suite for data integrity metrics. The test suite is used to check the data integrity of the current data. The suite is then run with the reference data and the current data. The results of the checks are printed out.

    Please note that the code above is a sample code snippet and may not work as expected without further adjustments.
