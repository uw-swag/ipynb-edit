The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook. It's used to perform a dataset check on the COCO dataset, which is a popular dataset for object detection tasks. The notebook first loads the dataset, then applies a brightness adjustment to each image in the training set. It then checks the dataset's drift using the ImageDatasetDrift check.

The second part of the code is a custom class DriftedCOCO that inherits from the COCOData class. It overrides the batch_to_images method to apply a brightness adjustment to each image in the batch.

The notebook then creates a new dataset, DriftedCOCO, that applies the brightness adjustment to the images in the training set. It also checks the drift of this new dataset using the ImageDatasetDrift check.

The notebook ends by running the check and displaying the results.

Please note that the code is not running as expected because the original code is not provided. The code is a part of a Jupyter notebook and it's not clear what the purpose of the code is.
