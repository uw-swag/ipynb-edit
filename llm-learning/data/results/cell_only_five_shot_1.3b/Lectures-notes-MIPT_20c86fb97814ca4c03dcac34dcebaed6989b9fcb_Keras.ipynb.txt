    ## Keras Notes

    Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation.

    Keras is built on top of TensorFlow, a powerful open-source platform for machine learning. It provides a simple and intuitive way to build neural networks by providing a high-level API.
