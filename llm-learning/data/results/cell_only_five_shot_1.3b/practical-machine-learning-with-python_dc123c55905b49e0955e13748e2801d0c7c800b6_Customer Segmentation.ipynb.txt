    The code you provided is a refactoring of a Jupyter notebook. The notebook is used to perform data analysis and visualization on a dataset. The original code was written in Python and used the Jupyter notebook platform.

    The refactoring process involved:

    1. Changing the language from Python to R.
    2. Changing the code formatting to a more readable and maintainable style.
    3. Adding comments to explain the code's purpose and functionality.
    4. Changing the code to be more efficient and easier to understand.
    5. Adding quality metrics to the code, such as the number of exact matches, token accuracy, and 3D scatter plot of the data.
    6. Changing the code to be more user-friendly and interactive.

    The refactoring process was successful in improving the code's readability, maintainability, and efficiency. The code now also includes quality metrics, making it easier to evaluate the performance of the data analysis and visualization tasks.

    The refactoring process also improved the code's user-friendliness and interactivity, making it more suitable for a wider range of users.

    The refactoring process also improved the code's readability, making it easier to understand and maintain.

    The refactoring process also improved the code's efficiency, making it faster and more efficient.
