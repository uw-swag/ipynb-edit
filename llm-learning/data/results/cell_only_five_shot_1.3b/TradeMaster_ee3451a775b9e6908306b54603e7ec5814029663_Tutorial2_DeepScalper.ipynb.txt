The code you provided seems to be a function definition for parsing command-line arguments. However, it doesn't seem to contain any bugs. It correctly parses command-line arguments and uses them to configure a configuration object.

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. The `parse_args()` function is defined to parse command-line arguments. It uses the `argparse` module to create a parser and add arguments to it.

2. The `args = parse_args()` line is used to call the `parse_args()` function and store the returned arguments in the `args` variable.

3. The `cfg = Config.fromfile(args.config)` line is used to load a configuration file from the path specified by the `args.config` argument.

4. The `task_name = args.task_name` line is used to assign the value of the `args.task_name` argument to the `task_name` variable.

5. The `cfg = replace_cfg_vals(cfg)` line is used to replace placeholders in the configuration file with actual values.

6. The `return args` line is used to return the parsed arguments.

If you have any specific issues with this code, please provide more details so I can help you better.
