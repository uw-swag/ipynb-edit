    The code you provided is a demonstration of how to use the Evidently library to compare different models and tests. The code imports a dataset, applies a machine learning model, and then compares the model's predictions to the actual values.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the `TestSuite` class to run multiple tests on a dataset. The `TestSuite` class is a collection of tests that can be run on a dataset.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the `ColumnMapping` class to map the target and prediction columns in a dataset.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the `TestSuite.run` method to run the tests on a dataset.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the `TestSuite.show` and `TestSuite.save_html` methods to visualize the results of the tests.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the `TestSuite.json` method to save the results of the tests as a JSON file.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the `TestSuite.save_json` method to save the results of the tests as a JSON file.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the `TestSuite.save_json` method to save the results of the tests as a JSON file.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the `TestSuite.show` method to visualize the results of the tests.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the `TestSuite.show` method to visualize the results of the tests.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the `TestSuite.show` method to visualize the results of the tests.
