    The code you provided is a series of Jupyter notebook cells. Each cell is a piece of code that performs a specific task. Here's a brief explanation of what each cell does:

1. The first cell is a function definition for a function `dhtml`. This function takes a string `st` as input and displays it in an HTML-formatted cell. The function also includes a JavaScript function that changes the font style of the HTML element when clicked.

2. The second cell is a function definition for a function `premodel`. This function takes three arguments: the number of pixels in the input images, the dense layer size, the model handle, and the number of labels. It then creates a sequential model with a Keras layer, a flatten layer, a dense layer, a dropout layer, and a dense layer. The model is compiled with an optimizer, metrics, and loss function. The model summary is also displayed.

3. The third cell is a function definition for a function `display_resize`. This function takes three arguments: the training, validation, and test sets of images, the number of pixels in the images, and the labels. It resizes the images to the specified number of pixels, and returns the resized images.

4. The fourth cell is a function definition for a function `cb`. This function takes a file path as input and returns a list of callbacks. The callbacks are an early stopping callback, a checkpoint callback, and a reduce learning rate callback.

5. The fifth cell is a function definition for a function `display_resize`. This function is used to load and preprocess the data. It loads the data from a HDF5 file, resizes the images, and returns the resized images.

6. The sixth cell is a function definition for a function `display_resize`. This function is used to load and preprocess the data. It loads the data from a HDF5 file, resizes the images, and returns the resized images.

7. The seventh cell is a function definition for a function `display_resize`. This function is used to load and preprocess the data. It loads the data from a HDF5 file, resizes the images, and returns the resized images.

8. The eighth cell is a function definition for a function `display_resize
