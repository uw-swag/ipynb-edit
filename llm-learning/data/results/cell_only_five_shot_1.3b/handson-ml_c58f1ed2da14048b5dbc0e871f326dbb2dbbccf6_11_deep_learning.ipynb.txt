    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses TensorFlow to train a neural network on the MNIST dataset. The notebook includes several cells where different operations are performed, such as loading the dataset, defining the model, training the model, and evaluating the model.

    The first cell is a simple code to load the MNIST dataset. The next cell defines the model architecture, including the number of hidden units and the dropout rate. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and the exponential decay learning rate. The last cell is the training operation, which includes the dropout operation on the hidden layer and the output layer.

    The code also includes a cell where the variables of the model are printed. This is useful for debugging and understanding the model's architecture.

    The code is well-structured and follows the typical TensorFlow workflow, with the model definition, training, and evaluation steps.

    The final cell is a training operation that includes the dropout operation on the hidden layer and the output layer. This is a common practice in deep learning to prevent overfitting.
