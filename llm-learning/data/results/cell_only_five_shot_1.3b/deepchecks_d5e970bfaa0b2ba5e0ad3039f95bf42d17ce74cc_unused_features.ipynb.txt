The code you provided is already in a good structure. It's a good practice to follow a consistent structure for your code, which includes organizing your code into functions, classes, and modules. This makes it easier to read, maintain, and debug.

Here's a suggested refactoring of your code:

1. Create a separate function for each step of the pipeline, such as `load_data`, `preprocess_data`, `train_model`, and `evaluate_model`.
2. Use a class to encapsulate the pipeline, and override the `fit` and `predict` methods to make the code more reusable and maintainable.

Here's a refactored version of your code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from deepchecks import Dataset
from deepchecks.checks import UnusedFeatures

def load_data():
    name_data = urlopen('http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.names')
    lines = [l.decode("utf-8") for l in name_data if ':' in l.decode("utf-8") and '|' not in l.decode("utf-8")]

    features = [l.split(':')[0] for l in lines]
    label_name = 'income'

    cat_features = [l.split(':')[0] for l in lines if 'continuous' not in l]

    train_df = pd.read_csv('http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data',
                           names=features + [label_name])
