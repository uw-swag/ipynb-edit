    # Section 2.5: Automatic Differentiation

    ## 2.5.1 Introduction

    Automatic Differentiation (AD) is a powerful technique used in machine learning and deep learning to compute gradients. It is a method of differentiation that allows us to compute the derivative of a function with respect to its input variables.

    ## 2.5.2 Backward Propagation

    Backward propagation is the process of computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network. The gradient is a vector that contains the partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to each weight.

    ## 2.5.3 AD in Machine Learning

    Automatic Differentiation (AD) is used in many machine learning algorithms, including neural networks, where the weights of the network are updated using gradient descent. The gradients computed during the backward propagation step are used to update the weights in the network.

    ## 2.5.4 AD in Deep Learning

    In deep learning, automatic differentiation is used to compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network. The gradients are then used to update the weights in the network.

    ## 2.5.5 Conclusion

    Automatic Differentiation is a critical tool in machine learning and deep learning, allowing us to efficiently train neural networks and perform gradient-based optimization.
