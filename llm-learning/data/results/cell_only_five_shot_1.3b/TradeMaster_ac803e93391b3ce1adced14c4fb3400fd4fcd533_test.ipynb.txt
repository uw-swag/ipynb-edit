    # Update Docker
    # Docker is a platform that allows developers to package an application with all of its dependencies into a single object, which can run on any machine that has Docker installed.

    # First, you need to install Docker. If you're using a Unix-like system, you can download it from the Docker website.

    # Once Docker is installed, you can create a Dockerfile. This file contains instructions for Docker to build an image.

    # Here's a simple Dockerfile for a Python application:

    FROM python:3.7
    WORKDIR /app
    ADD . /app
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
    CMD ["python", "app.py"]

    # Build the Docker image:
    docker build -t my-python-app .

    # Run the Docker image:
    docker run -p 4000:80 my-python-app

    # Update DeepTrader
    # DeepTrader is a Python library for backtesting trading strategies.

    # First, you need to install DeepTrader. You can do this using pip:

    pip install deep-trader

    # After installing DeepTrader, you can use it to backtest your strategy. Here's a simple example:

    from deep_trader import Trader
    from deep_trader.strategy import Strategy

    class MyStrategy(Strategy):
        def __init__(self, feed, info):
            super(MyStrategy, self).__init__(feed, info)
            self.buy()

        def on_bar(self, bar):
            if not self.position:
                if self.feed.get_price('AAPL') > self.feed.get_price('GOOG'):
                    self.buy()

    feed = DataFeed()
    feed.add_data_source('AAPL', 'yahoo')
    feed.add_data_source('GOOG', 'yahoo')

    trader = Trader(feed)
    trader.run_strategy(MyStrategy)

    # This will run your strategy and
