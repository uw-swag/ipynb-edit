    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that includes several sections, each of which is a different task. Here's a brief overview of what each section does:

    1. **Configuration parameters**: This section sets up the configuration parameters for the model, data, and training process.

    2. **Data processing**: This section imports necessary libraries, downloads the dataset, and preprocesses it. It also defines a function to style pandas dataframes.

    3. **TF Data**: This section imports necessary libraries, defines features for the model, and creates input functions for training and testing.

    4. **TF Regressor**: This section trains a DNN regressor on the processed data, evaluates the model, and makes predictions.

    The code is divided into several sections to make it easier to follow and to make it easier to modify or extend the model.

    Please note that the code is written in Python and uses the TensorFlow and Pandas libraries.
