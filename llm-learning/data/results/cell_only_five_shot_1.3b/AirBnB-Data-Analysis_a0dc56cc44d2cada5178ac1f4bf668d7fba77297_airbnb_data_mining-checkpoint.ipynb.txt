The code you provided is a Python script that uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and BigramCollocationFinder from the NLTK library to find the 10 most common bigrams in a column of a pandas DataFrame.

The function `get_corpus` is used to create a list of all words in the 'processed_info' column of the DataFrame.

The `BigramAssocMeasures` class is used to define the measures used in the BigramCollocationFinder.

The `BigramCollocationFinder.from_words` method is used to create a BigramCollocationFinder from a list of words.

The `nbest` method of the BigramCollocationFinder is used to find the 10 most common bigrams.

The result is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a bigram and its PMI (Pointwise Mutual Information).

The code seems to be well-structured and should work as expected. However, there are a few potential improvements that could be made:

1. Error handling: The code does not currently handle any potential errors. If the 'processed_info' column does not exist in the DataFrame, or if it contains non-string values, the code will throw an error.

2. Performance: The code is currently using a nested loop to process the 'processed_info' column. This could be improved by using a more efficient method to split the string into words.

3. Code comments: The code is not well-commented, which can make it harder for other developers to understand the purpose of each part of the code.

4. Function name: The function name `get_corpus` is not descriptive of what the function does. It could be renamed to something more descriptive, like `get_processed_info_corpus`.

5. Variable names: The variable names `data`, `df`, `corpus`, `bigram_measures`, `finder`, and `top10_collocations` are not descriptive of what they represent. They could be changed to something more descriptive, like `raw_data`, `dataframe`, `corpus_list`, `bigram_measures`,
