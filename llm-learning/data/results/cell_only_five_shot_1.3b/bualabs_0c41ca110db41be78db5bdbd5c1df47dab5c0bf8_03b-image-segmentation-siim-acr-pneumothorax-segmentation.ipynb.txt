The problem statement is to perform image segmentation on the Siim ARA Cancer Pneumothorax dataset. The dataset is a collection of images of patients with pneumothorax, and the goal is to segment these images into different regions of interest, such as the lungs, the chest wall, or the pneumothorax itself.

The dataset is available at the following link:

The dataset contains three folders:

- `stage_2`: This folder contains the training images. The images are labeled with the name of the patient and the date of the scan.
- `stage_2_images`: This folder contains the images of the same patients, but in different resolutions.
- `stage_2_train.csv`: This file contains the metadata of the training images, including the patient ID, the date of the scan, and the path to the image.

The dataset is quite large, with over 100,000 images. The memory footprint of the dataset is quite high, as it contains a large number of images and a large amount of metadata.

The code provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the GPU for memory management. It uses the `psutil` and `humanize` libraries to print the current memory usage and the free memory on the GPU.

The code also downloads the dataset from the provided link, unzips the files, and prints the memory usage of the dataset.

The code is written in Python and uses the `GPUtil` library to manage the GPU memory.
