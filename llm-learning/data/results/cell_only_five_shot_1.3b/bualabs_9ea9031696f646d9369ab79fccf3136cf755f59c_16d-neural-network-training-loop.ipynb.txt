    Commit Message: "Fix bug x not support more than 1 epoch in chart"
    Original Code Cells:
    '''
    x = torch.arange(n//bs+1).numpy()
    fig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(9, 9))
    ax.grid(True)
    ax.plot(x, losses, label="Loss")
    ax.plot(x, metrics, label="Accuracy")
    ax.legend(loc='upper right')

    '''
    ]

    ### Response:
    The issue with the code is that it's trying to plot `n//bs+1` points, but `n` is a variable that might not be defined in the scope where this code is running. 

    You can fix this by ensuring that `n` is defined before you use it in the plot. Here's how you can do it:

    ```python
    if 'n' in locals() or 'n' in globals():
        x = torch.arange(n//bs+1).numpy()
        fig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(9, 9))
        ax.grid(True)
        ax.plot(x, losses, label="Loss")
        ax.plot(x, metrics, label="Accuracy")
        ax.legend(loc='upper right')
    else:
        print("Variable 'n' is not defined")
    ```

    This code checks if the variable `n` is defined in the current scope. If it's not, it prints a message and doesn't plot anything.
