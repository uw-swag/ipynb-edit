    # Loading the dataset
    dataset = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')

    # Preprocessing the dataset
    # This step depends on the specifics of your dataset and what you want to achieve
    # For example, you might want to fill missing values, normalize numerical data, etc.

    # Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 0)

    # Feature Scaling
    sc = StandardScaler()
    X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = sc.transform(X_test)

    # Training the Random Forest Classifier
    classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators = 10, criterion = 'entropy', random_state = 0)
    classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Predicting the Test set results
    y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluating the model
    cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
    print('Confusion Matrix:')
    print(cm)

    print('Accuracy Score:', accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))

    # This is a basic example of how you might use a Random Forest Classifier in a real-world scenario.
    # In a real-world scenario, you would likely want to do more complex preprocessing, feature engineering,
    # hyperparameter tuning, and possibly use a different classifier.
