```python
    # Import necessary libraries
    import geopandas as gpd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Define the file path
    loans_filepath = data_path + "/kiva_loans/kiva_loans/kiva_loans.shp"

    # Read the shapefile into a GeoDataFrame
    world_loans = gpd.read_file(loans_filepath)

    # Plot the data
    world_loans.plot()
    plt.show()
    ```
    The code above reads a shapefile into a GeoDataFrame, then plots the data. The `data_path` variable should be defined somewhere in your code.
