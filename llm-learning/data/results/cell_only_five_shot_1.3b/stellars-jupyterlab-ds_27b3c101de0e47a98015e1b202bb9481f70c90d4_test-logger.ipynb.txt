    This Dockerfile creates a Docker image based on the Python 3.7-slim base image. It copies the current directory (where your Python script is) into the Docker image and installs the dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file. Finally, it runs your script.

    Please replace `your_script.py` with the name of your Python script.

    Also, make sure to replace `requirements.txt` with the actual path to your Python dependencies file.

    The `progressBar` function is a placeholder for a function that you would need to implement to create a progress bar. This function should take four arguments: the current progress, the total progress, the length of the progress bar, and a prefix string.

    The `logger` module is a placeholder for a module that you would need to implement. This module should have the same functions as the `logger` module in your original code, but it should not print anything.

    The `test_function` is a placeholder for a function that you would need to implement. This function should log an informational message.

    The `time.sleep` function is used to simulate a delay in the progress bar. Replace this with your own function to create a progress bar.
