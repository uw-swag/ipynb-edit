    The code you provided is a part of a machine learning model training process in Java. The model is a simple linear regression model, and it uses the Deep Java Library (DJL) for the training process.

    The `InitParams` class is a simple class that initializes the weights and biases for the linear regression model. The `train` method is the main training function that trains the model. It uses the SGD optimizer and the L2 penalty for regularization.

    The `train_djl` method is a similar function, but it uses the DJL's `Trainer` class for the training process. The `Trainer` class is a high-level API for training models, and it provides a more flexible and powerful interface for training models.

    The code also includes a line of code that prints the L1 norm of the weights, which is a measure of the magnitude of the weight vector. This is used to evaluate the performance of the model.

    The `l2Penalty` function is a helper function that computes the L2 penalty term for the regularization.

    The `lrt` and `sgd` variables are used to set the learning rate and the optimizer for the `Trainer`.

    The `config` variable is used to set the training configuration, including the loss function and the optimizer.

    The `model` variable is used to set the model to be trained.

    The `net` variable is used to set the neural network to be trained.

    The `trainer` variable is used to train the model.

    The `trainIter`, `trainData`, and `testData` variables are used to set the training and testing data.

    The `trainLoss`, `testLoss`, and `epochCount` variables are used to store the training and testing loss and the number of epochs for each iteration.

    The `l1norm` variable is used to compute the L1 norm of the weights.

    The `lr`, `wd`, `batchSize`, and `numEpochs` variables are used to set the learning rate, the weight decay, the batch size, and the number of epochs for the training process.
