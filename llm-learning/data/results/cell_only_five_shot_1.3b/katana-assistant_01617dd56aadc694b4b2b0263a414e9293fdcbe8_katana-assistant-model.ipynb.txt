    # This is a simple example of a Keras model. It's a feed-forward neural network with one hidden layer.
    # The model is trained to classify images of handwritten digits.

    # The model is composed of three layers:

    # 1. A dense layer with 128 units. The input shape is the number of input units (the number of 
    #    features in the training data) and the activation function is the Rectified Linear Unit.

    # 2. A dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.5. This is to prevent overfitting.

    # 3. Another dense layer with 64 units. The activation function is the Rectified Linear Unit.

    # 4. Another dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.5.

    # 5. A dense layer with the number of units equal to the number of classes in the training data.
    #    The activation function is the softmax, which is used for multi-class classification.

    # The model is compiled with the 'adam' optimizer, the 'categorical_crossentropy' loss function,
    # and the 'accuracy' metric.

    The model is trained using the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01,
    momentum of 0.9, and a weight decay of 1e-6. The model is then evaluated on the test data.
    The model's performance is reported as the accuracy of the model on the test data.
