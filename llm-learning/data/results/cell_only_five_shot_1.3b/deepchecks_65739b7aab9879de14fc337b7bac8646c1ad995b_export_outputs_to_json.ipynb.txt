    ## Links-checks Github Action Fix (#775)

    This issue has been resolved in the following way:

    - The Github action has been updated to use the latest version of the `actions/checkout@v2` action.
    - The `actions/checkout@v2` action is now the default action for checking out your repository.
    - The `actions/checkout@v2` action has been updated to use the `fetch-depth` parameter to prevent the action from fetching the `.github` folder.

    Please note that this is a minor fix and it should not impact the functionality of your repository.
