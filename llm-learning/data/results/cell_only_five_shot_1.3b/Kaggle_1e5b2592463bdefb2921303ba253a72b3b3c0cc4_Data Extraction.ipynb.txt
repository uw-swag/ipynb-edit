The code you provided is extracting NYC data using the Google Maps Distance Matrix API. It's a function that takes two addresses as input, calculates the distance and duration between them, and returns these as a pandas Series.

The function `row_proc` is used to process each row of the dataframe. It uses the Google Maps Distance Matrix API to get the distance and duration between the pickup and dropoff addresses.

The function `row_proc` returns a pandas Series with two elements: 'distance' and 'duration'. The 'distance' is the distance between the pickup and dropoff addresses, and the 'duration' is the duration of the trip in minutes.

The main part of the code is extracting the 'distance' and 'duration' columns from the dataframes `train` and `test`, and applying the `row_proc` function to each row.

Please note that you need to have the `googlemaps` library installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install googlemaps
```

Also, please replace `'AIzaSyDIN7pe-AheI0fOJQZVruapkv0gxBpt0R4'` with your actual API key.
