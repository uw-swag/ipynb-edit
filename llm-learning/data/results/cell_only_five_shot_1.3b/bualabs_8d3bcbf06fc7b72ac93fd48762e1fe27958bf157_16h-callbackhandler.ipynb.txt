    # Summary of callback and callback handler.

    # Callback is a function that is passed to a method to perform an action.
    # Callback handler is a function that is used to call a callback function.

    # In Python, callbacks are used to handle asynchronous operations.
    # They are a way to pass a function as an argument to another function.
    # This is useful when you want to perform an action in the background,
    # without blocking the main thread.

    # Here's an example of a callback and its handler:

    def callback(arg1, arg2):
        # This is the function that will be called by the callback handler.
        # It takes two arguments, arg1 and arg2, and does something with them.
        pass

    def callback_handler(callback, arg1, arg2):
        # This is the function that will be used to call the callback function.
        # It takes a callback function and two arguments, arg1 and arg2,
        # and calls the callback function with the given arguments.
        callback(arg1, arg2)

    # Now, you can use the callback_handler to call the callback function:

    callback_handler(callback, arg1, arg2)
    ```
    This code will call the `callback` function with the arguments `arg1` and `arg2`.

    Please replace `callback` and `callback_handler` with your actual callback and callback handler functions.

    Also, replace `arg1` and `arg2` with your actual arguments.

    This is a simple example, but callbacks and callback handlers are a powerful tool in Python,
    allowing you to write asynchronous code that can be used in different contexts.

    # Summary of Python's context manager.

    # A context manager is a class that implements the ContextManager protocol.
    # This protocol requires that the __enter__() and __exit__() methods be implemented.
    # The __enter__() method is called
