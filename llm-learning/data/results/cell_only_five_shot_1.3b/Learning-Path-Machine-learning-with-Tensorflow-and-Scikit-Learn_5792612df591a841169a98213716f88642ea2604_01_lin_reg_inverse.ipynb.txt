```python
    # Module02.py
    def function02():
        print("This is function02 in Module02.")

    # Module01.py
    def function01():
        print("This is function01 in Module01.")
    ```
    In the above code, two Python files (Module01.py and Module02.py) are created. Each file contains a function definition.
