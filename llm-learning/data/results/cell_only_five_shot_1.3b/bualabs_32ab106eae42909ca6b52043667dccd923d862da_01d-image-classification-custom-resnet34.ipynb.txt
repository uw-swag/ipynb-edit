    ### Response:
    The code you provided is already quite optimized for image classification tasks. However, there are a few things you could consider to improve the accuracy:

1. **Data Augmentation**: This is a technique that increases the amount of training data by applying transformations to the images. This can help the model generalize better and improve its accuracy.

2. **Model Architecture**: You are using a ResNet model, which is a good choice for image classification tasks. However, you could try using a different model architecture like VGG16, Inception, etc.

3. **Regularization**: You are using dropout, which is a regularization technique. You could try using other regularization techniques like L1 or L2 regularization.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: You are using a learning rate scheduler (`fit_one_cycle`) which is a good choice. However, you could try using a different learning rate scheduler like `ReduceLROnPlateau` or `ExponentialLR`.

5. **Early Stopping**: This is a technique where you stop training when the model stops improving. This can help prevent overfitting.

6. **Batch Normalization**
