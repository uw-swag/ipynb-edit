```python
    import unittest
    from your_module import VideoRecommendation

    class TestVideoRecommendation(unittest.TestCase):

        def setUp(self):
            self.video_recommendation = VideoRecommendation()

        def test_recommendation(self):
            # replace this with your actual test
            self.assertEqual(self.video_recommendation.recommend(), 'expected_result')

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()
    ```
    This is a simple unittest for the VideoRecommendation class. The test_recommendation method is expected to return 'expected_result' when the recommend method is called.

    Please replace 'your_module' and 'expected_result' with the actual module and expected result you want to test.

    Also, make sure to run this test in a separate environment where the VideoRecommendation class is not defined.

    This is a simple example and you may need to adjust it according to your needs.
