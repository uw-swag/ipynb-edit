```python

    import os
    import subprocess

    def sync_script(script_path):
        if os.path.exists(script_path):
            subprocess.run(['python', script_path])
        else:
            print(f"Script {script_path} not found.")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        script_path = "your_script.py"  # replace with your script path
        sync_script(script_path)
    ```
    This script will run the Python script located at the path specified. If the script does not exist, it will print a message indicating that the script was not found.
