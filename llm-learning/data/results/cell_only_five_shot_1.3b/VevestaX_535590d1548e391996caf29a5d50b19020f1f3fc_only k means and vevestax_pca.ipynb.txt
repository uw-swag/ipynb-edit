    ## K-Means Clustering

    K-Means is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering. It is a type of iterative algorithm that starts with a random assignment of data points to K centroids, and then iteratively reassigns the data points to the centroids of the clusters that they are currently in.

    ## Installation

    You can install the kmeans package using pip:

    ```python
    pip install kmeans
    ```

    ## Usage

    Here is a simple example of how to use the kmeans package:

    ```python
    from kmeans import KMeans

    # Create a KMeans object
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)

    # Fit the model to your data
    kmeans.fit(X)

    # Get the cluster assignments for each data point
    labels = kmeans.predict(X)
    ```

    ## Model

    The KMeans model is a simple implementation of the k-means algorithm. It assumes that the data points are in a Euclidean space and that the number of clusters is known beforehand.

    The model is a class that you can instantiate and fit to your data. The fit method takes as input the data to be clustered and returns the model. The predict method then takes the data and returns the cluster assignments for each data point.

    The model is also capable of handling categorical data. If your data is categorical, you can use the KMeansCategorical class instead.
