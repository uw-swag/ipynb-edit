    ### Response:
    # The code you provided is not complete and does not provide any code to update the logo. However, I can provide a general example of how to update a logo in a Python script.

    # Suppose you have a logo in a PNG format and you want to resize it to a smaller size.

    from PIL import Image

    # Open the image
    img = Image.open('logo.png')

    # Resize the image
    img_resized = img.resize((100, 100), Image.ANTIALIAS)  # Resize the image to 100x100 pixels

    # Save the resized image
    img_resized.save('logo_small.png')

    # Now, you can use the 'logo_small.png' file in your Python script.

    # If you want to update the logo in a web application, you can use HTML and CSS to display the image.

    # For example, you can use the following HTML code:

    ```html
    <img src="logo_small.png" alt="Logo" id="logo">
    ```

    # And the corresponding CSS code:

    ```css
    #logo {
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
    }
    ```

    # This will display the 'logo_small.png' image in a 100x100 pixel box.

    # Please note that the actual code will depend on the specifics of your application and the structure of your code.
