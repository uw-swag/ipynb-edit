    The code you've provided is a set of cells that are used to run a DeepChecks check on two datasets. The check is NewLabelTrainTest, which is a custom check for comparing the labels of two datasets.

    However, the commit message "Deleting notebooks (#1088)" suggests that the code is being used to delete notebooks. This is not a standard practice in Git commit messages, and it's not clear what the purpose of the commit is.

    If you're looking to delete notebooks, you would typically use the `rm` command in the terminal or command prompt, followed by the path to the notebook file. For example:

    ```
    rm /path/to/your/notebook.ipynb
    ```

    Please provide more context or clarify your commit message if you need further assistance.
