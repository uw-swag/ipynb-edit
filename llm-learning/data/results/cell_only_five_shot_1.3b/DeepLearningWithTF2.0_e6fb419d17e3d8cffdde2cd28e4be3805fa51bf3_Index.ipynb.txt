    # Preprocess the data
    # This step depends on the nature of your data
    # For example, you might need to handle missing values, outliers, etc.

    # Split the data into features and target variable
    X = df.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
    y = df['target_variable']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Create a Linear Regression model

    # Evaluate the model

    # Save the model for future use
    # This step depends on the requirements of your project
    # For example, you might need to save the model in a file, or use it for predictions
