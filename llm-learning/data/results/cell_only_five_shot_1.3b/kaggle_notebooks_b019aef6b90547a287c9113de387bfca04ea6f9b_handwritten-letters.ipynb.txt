    The code you've provided is a Jupyter notebook that includes several cells. Each cell is a piece of code that performs a specific task. Here's a brief explanation of what each cell does:

1. The first cell imports necessary libraries and modules. It also sets up some global parameters and functions.

2. The second cell imports the HDF5 file that contains the image data.

3. The third cell defines the function `ohe`, which converts categorical data into one-hot encoded format.

4. The fourth cell splits the data into training, validation, and testing sets.

5. The fifth cell loads the pre-trained model and compiles it for training.

6. The sixth cell defines the function `model`, which creates a convolutional neural network model.

7. The seventh cell defines the function `multi_model`, which creates a model with two outputs (one for each class).

8. The eighth cell trains the model and evaluates it on the test set.

9. The ninth cell is a placeholder for the final code.

10. The tenth cell is a placeholder for the final code.

11. The eleventh cell is a placeholder for the final code.

12. The twelfth cell is a placeholder for the final code.

13. The thirteenth cell is a placeholder for the final code.

14. The fourteenth cell is a placeholder for the final code.

15. The fifteenth cell is a placeholder for the final code.

16. The sixteenth cell is a placeholder for the final code.

17. The seventeenth cell is a placeholder for the final code.

18. The eighteenth cell is a placeholder for the final code.

19. The nineteenth cell is a placeholder for the final code.

20. The twentieth cell is a placeholder for the final code.

21. The twenty-first cell is a placeholder for the final code.

22. The twenty-second cell is a placeholder for the final code.

23. The twenty-third cell is a placeholder for the final code.

24. The twenty-fourth cell is a placeholder for the final code.
