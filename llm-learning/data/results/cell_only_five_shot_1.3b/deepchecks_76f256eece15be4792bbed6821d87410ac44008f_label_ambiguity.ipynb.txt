```python
    # Importing necessary libraries
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

    # Load the iris dataset
    iris = load_iris()

    # Split the dataset into training set and test set
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris.data, iris.target, test_size=0.3, random_state=1)

    # Create a KNN classifier
    knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)

    # Fit the classifier to the data
    knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Predict the response for test dataset
    y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)

    # Model Accuracy
    print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))

    # Plotting the confusion matrix
    from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
    import seaborn as sns

    cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
    sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt="d")
    plt.show()
    ```
    The above code is an example of how to use K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to classify the iris dataset. The accuracy of the model is printed, and a heatmap is also created to visualize the confusion matrix.
