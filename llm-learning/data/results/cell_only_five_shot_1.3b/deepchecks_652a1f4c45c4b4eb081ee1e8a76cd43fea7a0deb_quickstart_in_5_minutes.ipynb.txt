```python
    from deepchecks import Dataset

# We explicitly state that this dataset has no categorical features, otherwise they will be automatically inferred
# If the dataset has categorical features, the best practice is to pass a list with their names

ds_train = Dataset(df_train, label_name=label_col, cat_features=[], set_datetime_from_dataframe_index=False)
ds_test =  Dataset(df_test,  label_name=label_col, cat_features=[])
