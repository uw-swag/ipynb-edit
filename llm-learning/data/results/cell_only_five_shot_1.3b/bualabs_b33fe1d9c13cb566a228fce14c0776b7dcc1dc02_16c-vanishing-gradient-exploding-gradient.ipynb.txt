```python
    for i in range(50):
        x = x @ a 
        print(f'{x.mean()}, {x.std()}')
    for i in range(50):
        x = x @ a 
        print(f'{x.mean()}, {x.std()}')
    for i in range(50):
        x = x @ a 
        print(f'{x.mean()}, {x.std()}')
    x = torch.randn(100, 100)
    a = torch.randn(100, 100) * math.sqrt(2./100.) 
    for i in range(50):
        x = x @ a 
        relu(x)
        print(f'{x.mean()}, {x.std()}')
    ```

    The code has been updated to include print statements in the loop to provide feedback on the progress of the computation.
