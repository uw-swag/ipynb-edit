    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that contains several sections, each of which is a code cell. The sections are:

1. Importing necessary libraries and modules.
2. Defining a function to preprocess the data.
3. Defining callback functions for model training.
4. Loading and preprocessing images.
5. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image stylization.
6. Using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model for image stylization.
7. Using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for image stylization.
8. Training the models and evaluating their performance.

The code is divided into several sections to make it easier to understand and maintain. Each section is a code cell in the Jupyter notebook. The first section imports the necessary libraries and modules, while the last section trains the models and evaluates their performance.
