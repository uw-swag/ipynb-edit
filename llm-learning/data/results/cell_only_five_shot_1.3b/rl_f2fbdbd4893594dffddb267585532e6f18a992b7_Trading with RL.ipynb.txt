    Here is the refactored code for the market simulation. The simulation is based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, which is a stochastic process that describes the price of a financial asset as a function of time. The process is characterized by a mean reversion process and a random process.

    The code is divided into two parts:

    1. The first part of the code simulates the stock price based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.
    2. The second part of the code is a refactoring of the original code to improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

    The refactored code is as follows:

    ```python
    import random
    import datetime
    import pdb

    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd

    import plotly.graph_objects as go

    # set seeds for reproducibility
    random.seed(4465)
    np.random.seed(4465)

    # simulate market data
    total_time=10
    ticks = 10000
    tick_length = total_time/ticks

    m = 0.1
    k = 10
    amplitude = 0

    print("Amplitude: %.3f" % amplitude)
    print("Period: %.3f" % (2 * np.pi * np.sqrt((m/k))))

    # a = -ky/m
    start_trend = 100
    stock_price = start_trend + amplitude
    stock_velocity = 0

    noise = 0.01
    damping = 0.01

    trend_per_tick = 0.0
    trend_index = start_trend
    trend_series = []
    stock_series = []
    time_series = []

    for i in range(ticks):
        acc = - k / m * (stock_price - trend_index) 
        stock_velocity = stock_velocity + acc * tick_length
        stock_velocity = stock_velocity * (1-damping)
        stock_price += stock_velocity * tick_length
