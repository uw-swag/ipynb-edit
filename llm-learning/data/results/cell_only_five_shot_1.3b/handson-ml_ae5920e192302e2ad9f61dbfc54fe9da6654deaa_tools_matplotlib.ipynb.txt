```python
    from numpy.random import randn
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.animation as animation
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 1000)
y = 3*x + 5 + np.random.randn(1000)*2

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
scat = ax.scatter(x, y)

def update(num):
    scat.set_offsets(np.c_[x + num/100, y + num/100])

ani = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, update, frames=100, interval=20, blit=True)

plt.show()

writer = animation.writers['ffmpeg']
writer = writer(fps=15, metadata=dict(artist='Me'), bitrate=1800)
ani.save('my_wiggly.mp4', writer=writer)
    ```

    This code creates an animation of a scatter plot of a wiggly line. The animation is created by updating the position of the scatter plot in each frame. The animation is saved as a video file named 'my_wiggly.mp4'.
