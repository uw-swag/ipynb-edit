The code provided is a comprehensive guide to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model on the Fashion-MNIST dataset using TensorFlow. The model is then converted to TFLite format for efficient deployment. The code also includes a function to normalize the images, a function to build and compile the model, and a function to save the model in the SavedModel format. The code also includes a function to visualize the outputs of the model.

The code is divided into several sections, each of which is responsible for a specific task. The first section imports necessary libraries and sets up the TensorFlow environment. The next section defines a function to normalize the images. The next section defines a function to build and compile the model. The next section saves the model in the SavedModel format. The next section visualizes the outputs of the model.

The code is written in a way that it is easy to understand and maintain. The comments provide explanations of the code, which can be helpful for debugging and understanding the functionality of the code.
