    ### Response:
    The code you provided is already complete. It creates a Spark application to read MMTF files and perform an interaction analysis.

    However, if you want to add a new feature, you can do so by adding a new cell at the end of the code. For example, you could add a new cell to perform a sequence-to-sequence model using PyTorch or TensorFlow. Here's an example:
