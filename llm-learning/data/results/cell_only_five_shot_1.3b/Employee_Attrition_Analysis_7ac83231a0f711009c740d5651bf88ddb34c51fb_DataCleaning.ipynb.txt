```python
    # Cleaning the data
    # This step depends on the specific cleaning requirements of your data.
    # For example, if you are dealing with a dataset of images, you might need to remove or normalize images that are not part of the training set.
    # If you are dealing with a dataset of text, you might need to remove or normalize text that is not part of the training set.
    # If you are dealing with a dataset of time series, you might need to remove or normalize time series that are not part of the training set.
    # If you are dealing with a dataset of URLs, you might need to remove or normalize URLs that are not part of the training set.
    # If you are dealing with a dataset of geographical data, you might need to remove or normalize geographical data that is not part of the training set.
    # If you are dealing with a dataset of images, you might need to remove or normalize images that are not part of the training set.

    # Saving the cleaned data to a CSV file
    cleaned_data.to_csv('cleaned_data.csv', index=False)
