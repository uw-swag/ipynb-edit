    The code you provided seems to be a part of a machine learning model training process. The `trainCh11` function is a method that trains a model using a specific training configuration. The `TrainerConsumer` interface is a functional interface that defines a method for training.

    The `trainCh11` method is using a gradient descent optimizer (`Optimization::sgd`) to train the model. The `Optimization::sgd` method is a static method in the `Optimization` class, which is not defined in the provided code.

    The `trainSgd` method is calling the `trainCh11` method with a learning rate (`lr`) of 1.0, a batch size of 1500, and a number of epochs of 10.

    The `gdRes` variable is storing the result of the `trainSgd` method.

    The `trainCh11` method is using a `TrainerConsumer` to train the model. The `TrainerConsumer` interface is defined in the provided code, but it's not used in the `trainCh11` method.

    The `trainSgd` method is using a `TrainerConsumer` to train the model. The `TrainerConsumer` interface is defined in the provided code, but it's not used in the `trainSgd` method.
