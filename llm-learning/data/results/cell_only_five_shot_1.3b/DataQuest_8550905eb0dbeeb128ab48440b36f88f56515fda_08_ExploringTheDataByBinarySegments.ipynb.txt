```
    from git import Repo
    repo = Repo("path_to_your_project")
    repo.remotes.origin.pull()
    repo.head.reset('--hard', 'origin/master')
    ```

    This script will sync your project with the latest changes from the master branch on the remote repository.

    Please replace "path_to_your_project" with the actual path to your project.

    Also, this script assumes that you have a remote named "origin" in your repository. If you have a different name for your remote, you will need to replace "origin" with the name of your remote.

    Also, this script will reset your local branch to match the remote branch. If you want to keep your local changes, you should first merge them with the remote branch.

    Finally, remember to commit your changes before running this script.
