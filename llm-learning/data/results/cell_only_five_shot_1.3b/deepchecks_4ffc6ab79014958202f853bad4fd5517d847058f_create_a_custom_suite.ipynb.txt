    ### Response:
    The code you provided is a simple example of how to plot a power function using numpy and matplotlib. The function `y = x**-0.3` is plotted in the range of 0.1 to 1.1 with a step of 0.01. The plot includes a label for the function, x-axis label, y-axis label, and a title. The x-axis ticks are also set to a range of 0 to 1.1 with a step of 0.1.

    However, if you're looking to update the examples, you might want to consider adding more complex code or modifying existing examples. If you have a specific question or need help with something else, feel free to ask!
