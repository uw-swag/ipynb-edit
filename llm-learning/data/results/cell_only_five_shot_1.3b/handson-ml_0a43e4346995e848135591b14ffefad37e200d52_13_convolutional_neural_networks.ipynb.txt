The code you provided is a TensorFlow code snippet for a convolution operation on an image dataset. The issue you're facing is that the code is trying to plot the output of the convolution operation, but the function `plot_image` is not defined. 

To fix the bug, you need to define the `plot_image` function. This function should take an image as input and display it. Here's a simple implementation:

```python
def plot_image(image):
    plt.imshow(image)
    plt.show()
```

After defining this function, your code should work as expected.
