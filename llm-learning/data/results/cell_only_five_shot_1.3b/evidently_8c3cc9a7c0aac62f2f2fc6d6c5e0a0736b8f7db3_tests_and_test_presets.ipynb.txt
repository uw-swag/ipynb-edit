    Here is the modified code:

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np

    from datetime import datetime
    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml

    from evidently import ColumnMapping
    from evidently.test_suite import TestSuite
    from evidently.tests import *

    from evidently.test_preset import NoTargetPerformanceTestPreset
    from evidently.test_preset import DataQualityTestPreset
    from evidently.test_preset import DataStabilityTestPreset
    from evidently.test_preset import DataDriftTestPreset

    feature_level_tests = TestSuite(tests=[
        TestMeanInNSigmas(column_name='hours-per-week'),
        TestShareOfOutRangeValues(column_name='hours-per-week'),
        TestColumnShareOfMissingValues(column_name='education'),
        TestColumnValueDrift(column_name='education'),
        TestColumnValueRegExp(column_name='education', reg_exp=r"^\s+.*"),
    ])

    feature_level_tests.run(reference_data=ref, current_data=curr)
    feature_level_tests
    ```

    The commit message "Rename some tests (#457)" was added to reflect the changes made to the test suite. The test suite was renamed to "feature_level_tests" to make it more descriptive.
