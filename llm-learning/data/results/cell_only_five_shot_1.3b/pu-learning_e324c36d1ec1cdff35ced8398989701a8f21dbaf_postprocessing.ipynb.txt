    The code you provided is a Python notebook that uses a logistic regression classifier to predict whether a sample is positive or negative. The notebook first loads a dataset from the `scar` module, which is a dataset for the study of the scarlet (a type of cancer) in the brain. The dataset is then used to train a logistic regression classifier.

    The classifier is then used to predict the probability of the samples being positive, and the predicted probabilities are post-processed to ensure they fall within a certain range. The predicted probabilities are then used to predict the class of each sample.

    Finally, the `visualize_pn_data` function is used to visualize the original and predicted data.

    If you want to update the notebook to learn a classifier by postprocessing, you would need to modify the code to use a different classifier, such as a decision tree, or a neural network, and to adjust the postprocessing step.

    Here's an example of how you might modify the code to use a decision tree classifier:

    ```python
    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

    clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=0).fit(x, s)

    s_prob_hat = clf.predict_proba(x)[:, 1]
    y_prob_hat = np.minimum(s_prob_hat / C, 1.0)
    y_hat = (y_prob_hat > 0.5).astype(np.int32)

    visualize_pn_data(x, y)
    visualize_pn_data(x, y_hat)
    ```

    This code will train a decision tree classifier to predict whether a sample is positive or negative, and then visualize the original and predicted data.

    Please note that the code provided is a simple example and may not work as expected for your specific dataset. You may need to adjust the code to fit your specific needs.
