```python
    from mlchecks.checks.integrity.new_label import new_label_train_validation
    from mlchecks.base import Dataset
    import pandas as pd

    # Assuming 'test' and 'val' are your DataFrames
    new_label_train_validation(test, val)
    new_label_train_validation(test, val)

    # If you want to modify the check without a function, you can do it like this:
    def check_integrity(self, test, val):
        # Your code here
        pass

    # Then, you can set this function as the check in your dataset:
    dataset = Dataset(data=test, label=label, check=check_integrity)
    ```

    Please replace the `new_label_train_validation` function with your actual function. The function should take two parameters: `test` and `val`, which are your DataFrames. The function should perform the check on the data.

    Also, replace the `check_integrity` function with your actual check. The function should perform the check on the data.

    Finally, you can set the check in your dataset like this:

    ```python
    dataset = Dataset(data=test, label=label, check=check_integrity)
    ```

    Please note that the `check_integrity` function is a placeholder. You should replace it with your actual check.
