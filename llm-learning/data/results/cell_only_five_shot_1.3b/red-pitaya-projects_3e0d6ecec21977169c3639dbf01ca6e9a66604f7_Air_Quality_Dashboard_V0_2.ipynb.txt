The code you provided is a Python script that uses the matplotlib library to create an interactive plot of air quality data. The script collects data from an air quality sensor and displays it in real-time. The data includes temperature, VOC, alcohol, and other air quality measurements.

The code uses the `animate` function to update the plot with new data every 3 seconds. The `FuncAnimation` function is used to create the animation.

The code also includes a line that changes all VOC sensors to relative measurements. This is done by calling the `air_data.pms5003.read()` method, which reads the sensor data and returns a `pms5003_data` object. The `pms5003_data.pm_per_1l_air()` method is then used to calculate the PM per 1 litre for different concentrations of VOC.

The code also includes a line that changes the units of the temperature, VOC, and other measurements to relative to the reference values. This is done by calling the `air_data.analog_temp()`, `air_data.analog_voc_ratio()`, and `air_data.analog_alcohol_ratio()` methods, which return the measurements in relative units.

The code also includes a line that calculates the gas resistance for the BM680 sensor, which is used to measure the gas concentration in the room.
