```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Assuming you have a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a team name and its score
    teams = [('Team A', 10), ('Team B', 20), ('Team C', 15)]

    # Extract the team names and scores
    team_names = [team[0] for team in teams]
    team_scores = [team[1] for team in teams]

    # Create a bar chart
    plt.bar(team_names, team_scores)

    # Set the title and labels
    plt.title('League of Legends Winner Prediction')
    plt.xlabel('Teams')
    plt.ylabel('Scores')

    # Show the plot
    plt.show()
