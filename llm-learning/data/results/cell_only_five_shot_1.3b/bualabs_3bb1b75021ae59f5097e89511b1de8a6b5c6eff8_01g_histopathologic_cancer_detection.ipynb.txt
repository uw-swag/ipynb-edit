01g Histopathologic Cancer Detection

    The code is designed to detect histopathological cancer in mammograms. The model is trained using a DenseNet161 architecture with some modifications. The model is then fine-tuned and used for prediction.

    The code also includes an audio file for demonstration purposes.

    The code is designed to be run in a Jupyter notebook.

    The code is divided into several sections, each of which is a cell in the notebook. The purpose of each section is to explain what the code does.

    The final section of the code is the part that is run when the notebook is run. This includes loading the data, training the model, and making predictions.

    The code also includes a section for submitting the model to the Kaggle competition.
