    ## Updating Readme(s) and Iris example notebook (#181)

    This is a markdown cell.

    ## Updating Readme(s)

    This section is about updating the README.md file.

    ### Iris Example Notebook

    This section is about the Iris example notebook.

    ## Steps

    1. First, we will import the necessary libraries.
    2. Then, we will load the Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets.
    3. We will split the dataset into training and testing sets.
    4. We will train a model on the training set and evaluate it on the testing set.
    5. We will then update the README.md file with the results of the model evaluation.

    ## Code

    ```python
    # Import necessary libraries
    from sklearn import datasets
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

    # Load Iris dataset
    iris = datasets.load_iris()

    # Split dataset into training set and test set
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris.data, iris.target, test_size=0.3, random_state=1) 

    # Train a model on the training set
    clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Evaluate the model on the testing set
    y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
    print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))

    # Update the README.md file with the results of the model evaluation
    with open('README.md', 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()

    with open('README.md', 'w') as file:
        for line in lines:
            if "Accuracy:" in line:
                file.write
