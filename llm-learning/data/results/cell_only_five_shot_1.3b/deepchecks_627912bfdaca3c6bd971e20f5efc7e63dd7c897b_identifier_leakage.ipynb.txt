    The structure of the notebook can be improved by refactoring it to follow a more organized and scalable approach. This can be achieved by creating separate folders for each section of the notebook, such as "data", "code", "images", etc.

    Here's a simple example of how you can refactor your notebook:

    ```python
    ## Data
    ## Code
    ## Images
    ```

    Each section of the notebook can have its own Python file, and the notebook itself can be organized in a way that makes sense for your project. This will make it easier to manage and navigate the code, and it will also make it easier to add or remove sections as your project progresses.

    For example, you might have a file for data cleaning, another for feature engineering, and a third for model training. Each of these sections could be a separate Jupyter notebook, and you could organize them in the way I described above.

    This is just a basic example, and the actual structure of your notebook can depend on the specifics of your project. But hopefully, this gives you a starting point for refactoring your notebook's structure.

    ## Refactoring Steps

    1. Identify the sections of the notebook that are related to each other.
    2. Create a new directory for each section.
    3. Move the relevant cells from the original notebook to the new directories.
    4. Update the import statements to reference the new directories.
    5. Update the notebook metadata to use the new directories.

    This process can be automated using a script or a tool that can parse the notebook and reorganize the cells.

    ## Conclusion

    Refactoring the notebook's structure can make it easier to manage, navigate, and understand. It can also make it easier to add or remove sections as your project progresses.
