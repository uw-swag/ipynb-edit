    The original code is using TensorFlow 2.0 API. To update it to TensorFlow 1.0 API, you need to change the `tf.split` call to `tf.split` with `axis=1`. Here is the updated code:

    ```python
    with tf.name_scope('reslice'):
    Xs = [tf.squeeze(seq, [1])
          for seq in tf.split(1, sequence_length, Xs, axis=1)]
    ```

    This code will split the input tensor `Xs` along the second dimension (axis=1) and squeeze the resulting sequences to remove any singleton dimensions.
