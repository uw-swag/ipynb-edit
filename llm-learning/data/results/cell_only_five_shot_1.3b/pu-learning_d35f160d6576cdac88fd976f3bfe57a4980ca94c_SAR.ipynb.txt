    The provided code is a Python script that uses a labeling mechanism to transform the propensity score. The labeling mechanism is a method that assigns a label to each data point based on the propensity score. The propensity score is a measure of the probability of an event occurring, and it is used to create a binary classification problem.

    The LabelingMechanism class is defined in the code snippet you provided. The class has two main methods:

    1. `fit`: This method is used to fit the labeling mechanism to the data. It calculates the minimum and maximum values of the propensity score for each attribute.

    2. `propensity_score`: This method is used to calculate the propensity score of a given data point. It scales the propensity score of the data point based on the minimum and maximum values of the propensity score for each attribute.

    The `fit` method is called on an instance of the LabelingMechanism class with the data `x`. The `propensity_score` method is then used to calculate the propensity score of the data `x`.

    The `visualize_pn_data` and `visualize_pu_data` functions are used to visualize the propensity score and the original data, respectively.

    The code snippet you provided is a good example of how to use the LabelingMechanism class.
