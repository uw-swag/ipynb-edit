```python
    import os
    import pandas as pd

    # Assume you have a large file 'large_file.csv' in your current directory
    file_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'large_file.csv')

    # Read the file into a pandas DataFrame
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

    # Now you can perform operations on the DataFrame
    # For example, let's say you want to calculate the sum of a specific column
    total = df['column_name'].sum()

    print(f'The sum of the column is: {total}')
    ```
