    ### Practical 3: Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

    ## Objective:
    The objective of this practical is to implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.

    ## Requirements:
    - Python programming language
    - TensorFlow and Keras libraries
    - MNIST dataset (handwritten digits)

    ## Steps:
    1. Import necessary libraries.
    2. Load the MNIST dataset.
    3. Preprocess the data.
    4. Build the CNN model.
    5. Train the model.
    6. Evaluate the model.
    7. Predict the results.

    ## Note:
    This practical is a part of the broader Machine Learning course. It's recommended to follow along with the practicals in the course material.

    ## Hints:
    - You can use the MNIST dataset for this practical.
    - You can use the Keras library for building the CNN.
    - You can use the TensorFlow library for training the model.

    ## Submission:
    Submit the notebook file (.ipynb) containing the code, output, and any other necessary files.

    ## Grading:
    - Correct implementation of the CNN model.
    - Evaluation of the model on the MNIST dataset.
    - Submission of the notebook file.

    ## Resources:
    - TensorFlow's official documentation: https://www.tensorflow.org/
    - Keras's official documentation: https://keras.io/
    - MNIST dataset: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

    ## Deadline:
    The practical is due on the 10th of July, 2023.

    ## Important:
    This practical is a hands-on practical. You are expected to understand the concepts and implement them in your own environment.

    ## Note:
    This practical is a part of the broader Machine Learning course. It's recommended to follow along with the practicals in the course material.
