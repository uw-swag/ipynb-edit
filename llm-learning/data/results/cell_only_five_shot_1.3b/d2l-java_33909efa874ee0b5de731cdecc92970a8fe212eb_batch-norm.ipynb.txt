    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook and it seems to be a part of a larger system. The code is implementing batch normalization, which is a key component of many deep learning models.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The `batchNormUpdate` function is a method that performs batch normalization on a given input. It takes in the input data, the gamma and beta parameters, and the moving mean and variance, and returns the normalized input.

    - The `BatchNormBlock` class is a custom block in the neural network. It implements batch normalization, which is a key component of many deep learning models.

    - In the `forward` method of the `BatchNormBlock` class, the `batchNormUpdate` function is called to perform batch normalization on the input. The `training` parameter is set to `true` if the model is in training mode, and `false` if it's in inference mode.

    - The `BatchNormBlock` class also has a `getOutputShapes` method, which returns the output shapes of the block.

    The code seems to be part of a larger system, possibly a deep learning framework, and it's using batch normalization to normalize the input to a layer in the network.

    If you have any specific questions about this code, feel free to ask!
