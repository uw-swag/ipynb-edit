    ### Response:
    The code you provided is correct. It imports the necessary libraries for working with Excel files and the Python environment.

    The `os` library is used to get the absolute path of the current file.

    The `openpyxl` library is used to read and write Excel 2010 xlsx/xlsm/xltx/xltm files.

    The `xlwings` library is used to interact with Excel applications.

    Please note that you need to have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

    ```
    pip install openpyxl xlwings
    ```
