    This is a Maven configuration for a project that uses the Deep Java Library (DJL) for machine learning. The DJL is a high-performance, lightweight, and easy-to-use deep learning library. The project also uses the MXNet engine for deep learning.

    The DJL API and MXNet engine are both used in the project. The MXNet engine is used for the native part of the MXNet library, which is used for the computation of the model.

    The DJL API is used to create and train models, and the MXNet engine is used to run the model.
