    The code you provided is a simple example of using the Red Pitaya FPGA overlay module to generate and display a waveform. The waveform is generated by an oscillator (oscillator) on the FPGA, and the waveform is displayed using matplotlib.

    However, the code you provided is not actually modified. It's a simple example of how to use the Red Pitaya FPGA overlay module. The FPGA is set up to generate a waveform, and the waveform is displayed using matplotlib.

    If you want to remove the unchanged example files, you would need to replace the code with your own, and ensure that the new code is compatible with the existing codebase.

    Here's an example of how you might modify the code:

    ```python
    from redpitaya.overlay.mercury import mercury as overlay
    fpga = overlay()
    osc0 = fpga.osc(0, 1.0)
    # data rate decimation 
    osc0.decimation = 1

    # trigger timing [sample periods]
    N = osc0.buffer_size
    osc0.trigger_pre  = 0
    osc0.trigger_post = N

    # disable hardware trigger sources
    osc0.trig_src = 0
    # synchronization and trigger sources are the default,
    # which is the module itself
    osc0.reset()
    osc0.start()
    osc0.trigger()
    # wait for data
    while (osc0.status_run()): pass
    print ('triggered')

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # show only the part of the buffer requested by pre/post trigger timing
    data = osc0.data(N)
    plt.plot(data)
    plt.show()
    ```

    This code will generate a waveform and display it using matplotlib. If you want to remove the unchanged example files, you would need to replace the code with your own, and ensure that the new code is compatible with the existing codebase.
