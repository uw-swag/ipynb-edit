The code you've provided is a part of a larger code snippet that uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to make predictions. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. It creates a new instance of a NoopTranslator, which is a type of Translator that does nothing. It's used to convert input data into a format that the LSTM model can understand.

2. It creates a new instance of a Predictor, which is a class that uses a Translator to make predictions. In this case, it's using the LSTM model.

3. It uses the Predictor to make predictions on a set of features. The features are passed to the Predictor, and the predictions are retrieved.

4. It converts the time and x values to float arrays and creates two ScatterTrace objects, one for the time data and one for the 1-step predictions.

5. It creates a layout for the ScatterTrace objects, sets the title for the x and y axes, and creates a new Figure with the layout and the ScatterTrace objects.

6. Finally, it prints the 1-step predictions.

Please note that the code snippet you've provided is incomplete and may not work as expected. It's missing the part where the LSTM model is trained and the predictions are made.
