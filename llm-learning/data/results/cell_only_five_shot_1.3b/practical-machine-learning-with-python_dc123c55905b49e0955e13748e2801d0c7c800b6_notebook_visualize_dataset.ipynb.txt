    The code you provided is a set of functions and data manipulation operations. It uses the Python language and the libraries pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. The code is generating a random dataset, cleaning up column names, and performing various data analysis and visualization tasks.

    However, there's no code to remove the warning messages. The code you provided is a set of operations that are performed in a Jupyter notebook environment, and the warning messages are generated by the libraries used in the code.

    If you want to remove the warning messages, you can do so by commenting out the lines of code that generate the warning messages. For example, you can comment out the lines of code that generate the warning messages for the `pd.to_datetime` function:

    ```python
    # df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df.date)
    ```

    This will remove the warning message from the code. However, please note that this will not remove the warning messages from the libraries used in the code, such as `numpy` and `matplotlib`.

    If you want to remove the warning messages from all libraries, you can use the `warnings.filterwarnings` function to remove all warning messages:

    ```python
    import warnings
    warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
    ```

    This will ignore all warning messages, but it will not remove the warning messages from the libraries used in the code.

    Please note that removing warning messages is generally a good practice, as it can help to prevent potential issues in your code.
