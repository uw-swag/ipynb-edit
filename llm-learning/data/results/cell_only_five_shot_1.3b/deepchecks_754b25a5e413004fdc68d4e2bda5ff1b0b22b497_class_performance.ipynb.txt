```python
    class ClassPerformance:
        def run(self, train_ds, test_ds, yolo, prediction_formatter=det_formatter):
            # Your code here
            pass

    check = ClassPerformance()
    check.run(train_ds, test_ds, yolo, prediction_formatter=det_formatter)
    ```

    This code is a placeholder for the actual implementation of the `run` method. The `ClassPerformance` class is a placeholder for the actual class you're working with. The `train_ds`, `test_ds`, `yolo`, and `prediction_formatter` parameters are placeholders for the actual parameters you're using.
