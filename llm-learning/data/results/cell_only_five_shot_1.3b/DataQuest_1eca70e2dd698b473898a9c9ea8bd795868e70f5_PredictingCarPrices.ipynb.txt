    The code you provided is a guided project for predicting car prices using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The project is broken down into six steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is preprocessed by handling missing values, outliers, and normalizing the features.

2. **Model Training**: The KNN model is trained on the training data. The model is trained using the `knn_train_test_Univariate` function.

3. **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using the mean squared error (MSE) as a metric. The MSE is calculated for each feature in the test set.

4. **Feature Importance**: The importance of each feature in the prediction process is analyzed.

5. **Model Optimization**: The model's hyperparameters (like the number of neighbors `k_value`) are optimized using a process called grid search.

6. **Prediction**: The model is used to predict the car prices for the test set.

The code provided is a guide to follow, but it's important to note that the actual project might be more complex and involve more steps, such as data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning.
