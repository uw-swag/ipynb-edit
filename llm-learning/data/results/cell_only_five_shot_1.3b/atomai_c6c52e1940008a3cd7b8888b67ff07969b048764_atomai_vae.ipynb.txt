    ### Response:
    Here is how you can add a new notebook to Google Colab:

    ```python
    from google.colab import files
    uploaded = files.upload()

    for fn in uploaded:
        print('File name:', fn)
    ```

    This code will prompt you to select a file to upload. After you've uploaded a file, it will print the name of the file you uploaded.

    Please note that you need to run this code in a Colab notebook.
