    The code you provided is a part of a larger project, and it seems to be cleaning up a dataset for a sentiment analysis task. Here's a brief explanation of what the code does:

1. It imports necessary libraries and modules.
2. It defines a function `get_decoy_dataset` that generates a new dataset by adding a decoy word to a random part of the input text. The decoy word is inserted at a random position in the text, with a certain probability.
3. It then uses this function to generate three new datasets: one for training, one for development, and one for testing.
4. Each dataset is saved to a CSV file in the specified file path.
