    The code you provided is for a machine learning model, specifically a Linear Regression model. The code is using the sklearn library version 0.18. 

    The code is splitting the data into a training set and a validation set, and then fitting the model to the training set and evaluating it on the validation set. The RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) is calculated for both the training and validation sets.

    The code also uses the `plot_learning_curves` function to visualize the learning curves. The learning curves are a graphical representation of how the model's performance changes as the size of the training set increases.

    The code is then using a Linear Regression model, and calling the `plot_learning_curves` function to visualize the learning curves. The learning curves are then plotted with an axis range of 0 to 80, and a label for the y-axis.

    The code is then saving the figure with the name "underfitting_learning_curves_plot".

    The final line `plt.show()` is used to display the figure.

    The code is not actually running, as it is a Jupyter notebook cell. It's not meant to be run as a standalone program.

    Please note that the code is for educational purposes only. It's not recommended to use this code in a real-world application.
