    ## Code Explanation
    # The code is a Python script that uses the pandas library to process and analyze a dataset. The dataset is a sports statistics dataset from the 'data/' directory. The script restructures the data, creates features that represent the EMA of the data, and then applies a weighted average to each row. The restructured data is then used to train a logistic regression model.

    ## Dependencies
    # The script requires the following dependencies:
    - pandas
    - scikit-learn
    - matplotlib
    - os
    - getml

    ## How to Use
    # To use the script, you would need to run it in a Python environment. The script will read the dataset from the 'data/' directory, process it, and then use the processed data to train a logistic regression model.
