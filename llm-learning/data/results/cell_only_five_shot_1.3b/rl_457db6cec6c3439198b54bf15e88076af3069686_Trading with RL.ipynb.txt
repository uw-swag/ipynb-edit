    ### Table of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

    | Algorithm | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | Q-Learning | A value iteration method for estimating the value of a state-action pair. |
    | Deep Q-Learning (DQN) | A method for training a neural network that can learn to play a game. |
    | Policy Gradients | A method for training a policy, which is a function that maps states to actions. |
    | Actor-Critic Methods | A method for training a model that can learn to play a game. |
    | Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) | A search algorithm for decision-making problems. |
    | Genetic Algorithms | A search-based technique for approximating the value of an optimal policy. |
    | Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) | A method for selecting actions in a multi-armed bandit problem. |
    | Thompson Sampling | A method for sampling from a distribution that is known to be a mixture of several Gaussians. |
