The code you've provided is a Python script that uses the RedPitaya FPGA to collect data from two sensors: a temperature sensor and an alcohol sensor. The collected data is then plotted using matplotlib. 

The dashboard is updated with all sensors by calling the `animate` function every 2 seconds. The `animate` function collects data from the sensors, appends it to a pandas DataFrame, and then plots the data.

The dashboard is displayed using the `plt.show()` function. The `plt.show()` function displays the plot and keeps it open until it is closed.

The `df.size` line is used to get the current size of the DataFrame, which is used to set the timestamp.

The `df.index.name = 'timestamp'` line is used to set the name of the index of the DataFrame to 'timestamp'.

The `df` line is used to print the entire DataFrame.

The `plt.gcf().autofmt_xdate()` line is used to format the x-axis date labels to display in a more readable format.

The `plt.ticklabel_format(useOffset=False,axis='y')` line is used to remove the y-axis tick labels.

The `plt.legend()` line is commented out, as it is not necessary for the plot to display the legend.

The `plt.show()` function is used to display the plot.

The `ani = FuncAnimation(plt.gcf(), animate,interval=2000)` line creates an animation of the plot, where the `animate` function is called every 2 seconds.

The `plt.show()` function is used to display the plot.
