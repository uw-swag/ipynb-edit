    # OpenAI's EGS (Expert Systems)
    # OpenAI's EGS is a system that uses logic gates to perform complex computations.
    # It's a fundamental part of digital electronics and computer architecture.
    # Here are some related notes:

    # 1. Logic Gates: Logic gates are the building blocks of digital circuits. They are used to perform logical operations.
    # 2. Combinational Logic: Combinational logic is a type of logic where the output depends only on the input.
    # 3. Sequential Logic: Sequential logic is a type of logic where the output depends on the previous inputs.
    # 4. Digital Logic: Digital logic is a type of logic that is used in digital circuits.
