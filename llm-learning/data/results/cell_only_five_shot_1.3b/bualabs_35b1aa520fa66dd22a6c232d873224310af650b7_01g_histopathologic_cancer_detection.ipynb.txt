    The code you provided is a part of a larger code for a machine learning project. It's a PyTorch implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The code includes the following steps:

1. Mounting Google Drive to access Kaggle datasets.
2. Downloading and unzipping the datasets.
3. Preprocessing the datasets.
4. Training the model using the training data.
5. Evaluating the model on the validation data.
6. Submitting the model to the Kaggle competition.

The code is using the Ranger optimizer, which is a fast and efficient optimizer for machine learning. However, the code is not complete and there are some missing parts.

The missing parts are:

- The code for setting up the notebook for PySpark.
- The code for training the model with the Ranger optimizer.
- The code for evaluating the model.
- The code for submitting the model to the Kaggle competition.

Please provide the missing parts of the code.
