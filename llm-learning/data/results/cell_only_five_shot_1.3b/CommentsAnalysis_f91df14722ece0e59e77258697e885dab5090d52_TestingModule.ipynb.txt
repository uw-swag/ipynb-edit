```python
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

    # Split the data
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Create a Logistic Regression model
    model = LogisticRegression(min_df=1, class_weight='balanced', less_regularization=False, fit_intercept=False, threshold=0.5)

    # Fit the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Predict the test set
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Calculate the accuracy
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

    print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
    ```

    This code will create a Logistic Regression model with the specified parameters. It then fits the model to the training data and makes predictions on the test data. Finally, it calculates and prints the accuracy of the model.
