```python
    import pickle
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/pickle', methods=['POST'])
    def pickle_model():
        data = request.get_json()
        model = pickle.load(open('model.pkl', 'rb'))
        prediction = model.predict([data['features']])
        return jsonify({'prediction': prediction[0]})

    @app.route('/logistic_regression', methods=['POST'])
    def logistic_regression():
        data = request.get_json()
        with open('model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
            model = pickle.load(f)
        prediction = model.predict([data['features']])
        return jsonify({'prediction': prediction[0]})

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True)
    ```

    This code adds two new routes to the Flask application:

    - `/pickle`: This route uses the pickle module to load a pre-trained model and make a prediction. The model is loaded from a file named 'model.pkl'.

    - `/logistic_regression`: This route uses the Logistic Regression model from scikit-learn. The model is loaded from a file named 'model.pkl'.

    The `pickle_model` and `logistic_regression` functions are decorated with `@app.route`, which means they are accessible at the corresponding URLs. The `request.get_json()` function is used to get the JSON data from the request, and the `jsonify` function is used to return a JSON response.
