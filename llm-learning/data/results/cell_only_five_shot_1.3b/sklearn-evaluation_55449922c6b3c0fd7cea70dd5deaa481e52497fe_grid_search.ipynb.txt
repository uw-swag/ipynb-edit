    Jupyter Book is a new format for documenting Jupyter notebooks. It's a project that aims to make it easier to create, maintain, and share Jupyter notebooks.

    Here are the steps to migrate your docs to Jupyter Book:

    1. **Install Jupyter Book**: You can install Jupyter Book using pip:

       ```bash
       pip install jupyter-book
       ```

    2. **Create a new Jupyter Book**: Create a new directory for your book and initialize it as a Jupyter Book:

       ```bash
       jupyter-book create my-book
       ```

    3. **Move your docs into the book's directory**: Move your docs into the `docs` directory of your book.

    4. **Start the Jupyter Book server**: Navigate into your book's directory and start the Jupyter Book server:

       ```bash
       cd my-book
       jupyter-book serve
       ```

    5. **Open your book in a web browser**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`. You should see your docs in a new tab.

    This is a basic guide. Depending on your needs, you might need to customize your Jupyter Book further. For more information, refer to the [Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/).
