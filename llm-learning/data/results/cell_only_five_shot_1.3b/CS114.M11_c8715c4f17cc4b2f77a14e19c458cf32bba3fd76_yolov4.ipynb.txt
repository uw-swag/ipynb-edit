```python
    # Load the pre-trained Keras model, ensuring the head FC layer sets are left off
    model = load_model('yolov4.weights.h5')

    # Load the pre-trained model's configuration file
    with open('yolov4.cfg') as f:
        config = f.read()

    # We need to compile our model a second time, this time specifying the optimizer and the
    # loss function. Even though we are using a config file, we can also specify the 
    # optimizer and loss function manually.
    model.compile(optimizer = Adam(), loss = 'objective_function', config = config)

    # Then we can train our model to the same place but with a different 
    # configuration file
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_data = (X_test, y_test), batch_size = 10, epochs = 10)

    # Save the model
    model.save('yolov4_trained.h5')
    ```
