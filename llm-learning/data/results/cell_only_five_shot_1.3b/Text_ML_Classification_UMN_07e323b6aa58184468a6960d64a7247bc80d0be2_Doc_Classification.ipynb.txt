    ## Create a new notebook in Google Colab

    Google Colab is a free cloud service that allows you to create and run Jupyter notebooks in a browser. It's a great tool for experimenting with data analysis and machine learning.

    Here's how you can create a new notebook in Google Colab:

    1. Go to the Google Colab website (https://colab.research.google.com/).
    2. Click on the "New Notebook" button.
    3. Select the "Python" kernel (the first one in the list).
    4. Click on the "Create" button.

    Now you have a new notebook in Google Colab. You can start coding in the cells that are marked with `# START` and `# END` comments.

    Here's an example of how you can use Google Colab to create a new notebook:

    ```python
    # START
    # Create a new notebook in Google Colab

    # Go to the Google Colab website (https://colab.research.google.com/)
    # Click on the "New Notebook" button.
    # Select the "Python" kernel (the first one in the list).
    # Click on the "Create" button.

    # Now you have a new notebook in Google Colab. You can start coding in the cells that are marked with `# START` and `# END` comments.
    # END
    ```

    Remember, you can run the code in the cells that are marked with `# START` and `# END` comments in the notebook itself.

    Google Colab is a powerful tool for experimenting with data analysis and machine learning. It's particularly useful for prototyping and testing your ideas.
