    The notebook has been completed successfully. It reads a CSV file, splits it into training and validation sets, and then trains a model using the movie reviews dataset. The model is a simple binary classifier, which is a part of the deep learning approach. The model is trained using the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model, which is a type of recurrent neural network. The LSTM model is used to classify the movie reviews as positive or negative.

    The notebook also finishes by unzipping a file, loading a pickle file, and using the pickle file to convert n-grams to indices.

    The final output of the notebook is the number of training and validation examples, and the accuracy of the model on the validation set.
