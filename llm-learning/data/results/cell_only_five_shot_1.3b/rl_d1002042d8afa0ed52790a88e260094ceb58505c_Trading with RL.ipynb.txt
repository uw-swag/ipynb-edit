    Your code is a simulation of a trading strategy using a Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. The strategy involves simulating market data, applying a simple harmonic motion trend to the stock prices, adding noise and damping, and then simulating trading actions. The resulting data is then plotted using Plotly.

    The strategy is profitable if the total reward is positive, which is the sum of the reward for each timestep. The simulation is run for 100000 time steps, with a tick length of 100000 ticks. The simulation is run for 1000 time steps to get a more accurate simulation.

    The simulation is run with a constant coefficient of 100, which is a common value for simple harmonic motion. The amplitude of the trend is set to 0, which means there is no trend in the market data. The start trend is set to 100, which means the trend starts at 100. The trend per tick is set to 0.0, which means there is no trend per tick. The noise is set to 0.1, which means there is some noise in the market data. The damping is set to 0.05, which means there is some damping in the market data.

    The simulation is run with a verbose level of 1, which means more information is printed to the console.

    The simulation is run with a window size of 2 * pi * sqrt(1/coef), which is the period of the OU process.

    The simulation is run with a tick length of total_time/ticks, which is the time between each tick in the simulation.
