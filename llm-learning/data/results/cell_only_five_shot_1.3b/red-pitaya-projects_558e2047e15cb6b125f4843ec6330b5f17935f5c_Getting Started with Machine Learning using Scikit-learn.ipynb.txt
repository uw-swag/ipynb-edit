```python
    # Importing necessary libraries
    import serial

    # Opening the serial port
    ser = serial.Serial('COM3', 9600)

    # Reading data from the serial port
    data = ser.read(10)

    # Converting the binary data to string
    string_data = data.decode()

    # Printing the data
    print(string_data)

    # Closing the serial port
    ser.close()
    ```

    This code will read data from a serial port connected to the COM3 port. The data is then decoded from binary to string and printed. The serial port is then closed.

    Please replace 'COM3' with the actual port name if it's different.

    Also, please note that you need to have the necessary permissions to access the serial port.
