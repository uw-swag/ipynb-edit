```python
    import openai
    import requests
    from PIL import Image

    # Set up the OpenAI API key
    openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

    # Define the prompt for the image
    prompt = "A cute cat"

    # Use DALL-E to generate an image
    response = openai.Image.create(
        prompt=prompt,
        n=1,
        size="1024x1024"
    )

    # Save the generated image
    image_url = response['data'][0]['url']
    image_data = requests.get(image_url).content
    with open('generated_image.png', 'wb') as handler:
        handler.write(image_data)

    # Create an image from the saved file
    img = Image.open('generated_image.png')
    img.show()
    ```

    This code uses the DALL-E model from OpenAI to generate an image based on the provided prompt. The generated image is then saved as a PNG file and displayed using the PIL library.
