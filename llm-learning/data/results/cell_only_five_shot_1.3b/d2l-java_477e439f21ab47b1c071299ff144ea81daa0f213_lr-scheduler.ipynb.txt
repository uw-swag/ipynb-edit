The code you provided is a part of a machine learning model training process using the DL4J (Deep Learning for Java) library. The version of DL4J you're using is 0.13.0, and the commit message indicates that there's a bug or issue with the code when working with italic text.

The italic text in the code is used to denote comments or instructions, which is not a standard way to format text in code. The code is written in Java, and the italic text is not a recognized language syntax.

If you're seeing this issue, it's likely that the code is not correctly formatted or the DL4J library is not updated to the version you're using. You might want to check the DL4J documentation or the DL4J GitHub repository to see if there's a known issue with the version you're using.

If the issue persists, you might want to consider updating the DL4J library to the latest version, or using a different method to format your code.
