    # In a real-world scenario, you would replace this with the actual version bump code.
    # For example, if you're using Semantic Versioning, you might increment the major version (0.x.x)
    # and then increment the minor version (x.0.x) or the patch version (x.x.0) as needed.
    # Here, we're just incrementing the patch version for the sake of this example.
