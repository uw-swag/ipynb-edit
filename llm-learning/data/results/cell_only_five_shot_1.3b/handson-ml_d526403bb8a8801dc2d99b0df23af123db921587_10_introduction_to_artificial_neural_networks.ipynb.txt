    The code you provided is already using TensorFlow 1.0.0. TensorFlow 1.0.0 is the latest stable version of the TensorFlow library. It is a major version upgrade from TensorFlow 0.12, and it includes many improvements, bug fixes, and new features.

    However, it's important to note that TensorFlow 1.0.0 is not backward-compatible with TensorFlow 0.12. This means that you can't directly use TensorFlow 0.12 code in a TensorFlow 1.0.0 environment. You'll need to rewrite your code to be compatible with TensorFlow 1.0.0.

    In your code, you're using the `tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits` function, which is a TensorFlow 0.12 function. If you want to use TensorFlow 1.0.0 features, you'll need to replace this function with the equivalent TensorFlow 1.0.0 function.

    For example, in TensorFlow 0.12, you would use `tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits`. In TensorFlow 1.0.0, you would use `tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits`.

    If you're using TensorFlow 0.12 code, you'll need to replace all instances of `tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits` with `tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits`.

    In summary, you should replace all instances of `tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits` with `tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits` in your TensorFlow 1.0.0 code.
