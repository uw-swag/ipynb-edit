The code you provided is a demonstration of how to use the `evidently` library to create a data drift dashboard and profile. The dashboard is used to visualize the differences between two datasets, and the profile is used to analyze the data drift.

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. The first part of the code imports necessary libraries and loads the Boston housing dataset.

2. The second part of the code creates a data drift dashboard for the first 200 rows of the dataset.

3. The third part of the code creates a column mapping and calculates the data drift for the first 200 rows of the dataset.

4. The fourth part of the code creates a data drift profile for the first 200 rows of the dataset.

5. The last part of the code calculates the data drift profile and converts it to JSON format.

The code is organized in a way that makes it easy to follow along with the examples. The dashboard and profile are saved to HTML files in the 'reports' directory.

To move the GitBook docs to the repository, you would need to commit and push the changes to the repository. The exact process depends on the version control system you are using (e.g., Git, SVN, etc.).
