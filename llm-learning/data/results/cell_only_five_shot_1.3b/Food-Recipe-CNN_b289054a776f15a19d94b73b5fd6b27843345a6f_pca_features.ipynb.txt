    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the Keras library to load and preprocess images, and then uses the Inception V3 model to classify images. The notebook also uses the NMSLIB library to find the closest images to a query image.

    The notebook contains several functions, including:

    - `load_models`: This function loads the Inception V3 model and the VGG16 model.
    - `get_image_vgg`: This function loads an image, preprocesses it, and returns a numpy array of its pixels.
    - `get_image_inc`: This function loads an image, preprocesses it, and returns a numpy array of its pixels.
    - `plot_preds`: This function plots the probabilities of the Inception V3 model's categories.
    - `plot_distances`: This function plots the distances between the query image and the images in the database.
    - `show_result_images`: This function displays the images of the top 7 most similar images.
    - `get_closest_images_nmslib`: This function uses the NMSLIB library to find the closest images to the query image.
    - `get_concatenated_images`: This function concatenates the images of the top 7 most similar images.
    - `get_corresponding_recipes`: This function returns the corresponding recipes to the top 7 most similar images.
    - `weighting_neural_net_inputs`: This function combines the outputs from the Inception V3 model and the VGG16 model to a result list.
    - `model_predict`: This function uses the Inception V3 model to classify an image, and the VGG16 model to find the top 7 most similar images.

    The final part of the notebook uses the `model_predict` function to classify an image, and then uses the `food_list_html` function to display the top 7 most similar images.

    The notebook also contains a cell that displays the top 7 most similar images.

    The notebook is updated to include a new cell that uses the `model_predict` function to classify an image, and then uses the `
