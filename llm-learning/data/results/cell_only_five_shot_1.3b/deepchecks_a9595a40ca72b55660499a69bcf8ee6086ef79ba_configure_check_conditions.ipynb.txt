    ## 7-14 collab and github links pointed to original repo main

    The original repository can be found at: https://github.com/original_username/original_repo_name

    The links to the 7th to 14th collaborators in the repository can be found at:
    - https://github.com/username/repo_name/pull/7
    - https://github.com/username/repo_name/pull/8
    - https://github.com/username/repo_name/pull/9
    - https://github.com/username/repo_name/pull/10
    - https://github.com/username/repo_name/pull/11
    - https://github.com/username/repo_name/pull/12
    - https://github.com/username/repo_name/pull/13
    - https://github.com/username/repo_name/pull/14

    The main branch of the repository can be found at: https://github.com/username/repo_name/tree/main
    ```
    This code will generate the documentation for the 7-14 pull requests in the original repository.
    Please replace `original_username`, `original_repo_name`, and `username` with your actual GitHub usernames.
    Also, make sure to replace the links with the actual links to the pull requests in the original repository.
    The main branch link is just a placeholder, you should replace it with the actual link to the main branch.
    The code assumes that the links are for the 7th to 14th pull requests. If the range of pull requests is different, you will need to adjust the code accordingly.
    Please note that this code will only work if the original repository has been forked and the collaborators have been added to the forked repository.
    If the original repository is not forked, you will need to manually add the collaborators to the forked repository.
    Also, the code assumes that the collaborators have access to the original repository. If they do not, you will need to add them to the forked repository.
    The code also assumes that the collaborators have access to the main branch of the repository
