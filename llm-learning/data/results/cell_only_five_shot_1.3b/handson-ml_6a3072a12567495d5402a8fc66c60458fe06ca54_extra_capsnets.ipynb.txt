    The code you provided seems to be correct. The error in the code is that the `saver.restore(sess, checkpoint_path)` line is missing a closing parenthesis. Here is the corrected version:

    ```python
    with tf.Session() as sess:
        saver.restore(sess, checkpoint_path)
    ```

    Also, the `caps2_output`, `decoder_output`, and `y_pred` variables are not defined in the provided code. Make sure they are defined before using them in the `sess.run` function.
