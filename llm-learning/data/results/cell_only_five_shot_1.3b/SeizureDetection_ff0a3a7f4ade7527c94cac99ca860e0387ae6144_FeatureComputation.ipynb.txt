    The code you provided is a set of functions for feature extraction from EEG data. The functions are designed to extract various features from the EEG data such as time domain features, frequency domain features, and correlation features.

    The functions are:

    1. `leftRightHemisphericChannels`: This function is used to compute the average left and right hemisphere power.

    2. `computeTimeDomainFeatures`: This function is used to compute various time domain features such as mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, standard deviation, median, zero cross rate, coefficient of variation, root mean square, peak to peak, and sample entropy of the input signal.

    3. `psd`: This function is used to compute the power spectral density of the input signal.

    4. `featureExtractionLeftRight`: This function is used to extract features from the left and right hemisphere of the EEG data.

    5. `featureExtractionAverage`: This function is used to extract features from a surrogate signal.

    6. `featureExtractionFull`: This function is used to extract features from the full EEG data.

    The code also includes a function `computeCorrelation`, which is not included in the original code you provided.

    Please note that the code is written in Python and uses the pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn libraries.

    The code is designed to be modular and can be easily extended to include additional features or to use different methods for feature extraction.
