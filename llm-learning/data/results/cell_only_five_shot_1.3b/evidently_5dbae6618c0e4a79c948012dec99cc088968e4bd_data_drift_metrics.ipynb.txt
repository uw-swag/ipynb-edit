    ### Explanation:
    The provided code is a test suite for a data quality test. The test preset used in this test suite is a NoTargetPerformanceTestPreset, which is a simple test that checks the performance of a model by comparing the performance of a model on the current data with a model on the reference data.

    The test preset is configured to check the performance of a model by comparing the "education-num" and "hours-per-week" columns of the current data with the "education-num" and "hours-per-week" columns of the reference data.

    The code snippet renames the parameters in the test preset to "education-num" and "hours-per-week" to avoid any confusion or potential misinterpretation.

    The updated code is then run on the current_data and reference_data. The result of the test suite is then printed.

    The final output of the code will be the result of the test suite, which includes the results of the test preset.
