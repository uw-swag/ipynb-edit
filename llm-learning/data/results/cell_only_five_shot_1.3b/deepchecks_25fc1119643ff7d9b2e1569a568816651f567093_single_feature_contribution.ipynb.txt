    Commit Message: "Adding nblinks instead of copy (#292)"
    Original Code Cells:
    '''
    nblinks = ds.buildings.nblinks
    '''
    ]

    ### Response:
    The code you provided is already using the `nblinks` attribute of the `ds.buildings` object, which is a list of links between buildings. This attribute is not a copy, it's a property of the `ds.buildings` object.

    If you want to create a copy of this attribute, you can use the `copy()` method. Here's how you can do it:

    ```python
    nblinks_copy = ds.buildings.nblinks.copy()
    ```

    This will create a new list `nblinks_copy` that is a copy of the original `nblinks` list.

    If you want to use the `nblinks` list in your code, you can just use it as you normally would.

    If you're seeing a different result, please provide more context or the original code you're referring to.
