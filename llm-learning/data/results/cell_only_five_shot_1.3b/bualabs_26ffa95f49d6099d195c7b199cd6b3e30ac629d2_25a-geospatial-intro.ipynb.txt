```python
    # Install geopandas
    !pip install geopandas

    # Install kaggle
    !pip install kaggle --upgrade

    # Set the config path in kaggle
    !kaggle config set -n path -v "{config_path}/My Drive"
    ```

    The above code snippet is used to install geopandas and kaggle, and set the config path in kaggle. The `{config_path}/My Drive` is a placeholder for the actual path where you want to set the config path. You need to replace it with the actual path where you want to set the config path.
