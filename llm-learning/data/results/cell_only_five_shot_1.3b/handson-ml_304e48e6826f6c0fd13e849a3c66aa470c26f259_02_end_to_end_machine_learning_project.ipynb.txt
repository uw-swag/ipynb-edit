    The code provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses various machine learning algorithms to predict housing prices in the Boston dataset. The notebook starts with importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset. Then, it prepares the data for machine learning by scaling it and splitting it into training and testing sets.

    The notebook then trains a Linear Regression model, a Random Forest Regressor model, and a Support Vector Regressor model. The notebook also uses GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for these models.

    The notebook then uses RandomizedSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for these models. The notebook also uses Exponential and Reciprocal distribution to generate samples and histograms them.

    The notebook ends with a comparison of the results of the different models.

    The notebook's output is saved in the "images" directory of the current working directory.

    The notebook's output is the same every time it is run, as the random seed is set to 42.

    The notebook's output is displayed in the notebook itself, and the plots are saved as images in the "images" directory of the current working directory.

    The notebook's output is the same every time it is run, as the random seed is set to 42.
