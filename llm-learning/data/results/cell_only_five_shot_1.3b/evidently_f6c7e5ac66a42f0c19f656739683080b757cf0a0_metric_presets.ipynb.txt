    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook and it's written in Python. It's using the Evidently library, which is a Python library for creating, analyzing, and visualizing data-driven insights.

    The code is adding a new metric to the report. The new metric is a custom metric that calculates the performance metrics for a classification problem. The performance metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The `ColumnMapping` class is used to map the target column to the prediction column.
    - The `DataIntegrityMetrics` class is used to calculate metrics for data integrity.
    - The `DataIntegrityValueByRegexpMetrics` class is used to calculate metrics for data integrity based on a regular expression.
    - The `DataIntegrityNullValuesMetrics` class is used to calculate metrics for data integrity based on null values.
    - The `DataDriftTable` class is used to create a table of data drift metrics.
    - The `RegressionPerformanceMetrics` class is used to calculate metrics for regression performance.
    - The `DataQualityMetrics` class is used to calculate metrics for data quality.
    - The `DataQualityStabilityMetrics` class is used to calculate metrics for data quality stability.
    - The `DataQualityValueListMetrics` class is used to calculate metrics for data quality based on a list of values.
    - The `DataQualityValueRangeMetrics` class is used to calculate metrics for data quality based on a range of values.
    - The `DataQualityValueQuantileMetrics` class is used to calculate metrics for data quality based on a quantile of values.
    - The `DataQualityCorrelationMetrics` class is used to calculate metrics for data quality based on correlation.
    - The `ClassificationPerformanceMetrics` class is used to calculate metrics for classification performance.
    - The `ClassificationPerformanceMetricsTopK` class is used to calculate metrics for classification performance based on the top k classes.
    - The `ClassificationPerformanceMetricsThreshold` class is used to calculate metrics for classification performance based on a threshold.

    The `report.run` method is used to run the metrics on the current and reference data
