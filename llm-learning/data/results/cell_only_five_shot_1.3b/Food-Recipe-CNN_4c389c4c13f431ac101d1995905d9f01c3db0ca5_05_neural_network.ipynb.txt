```python
    import os
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from PIL import Image

    # Assuming that you have a function to load images
    def load_image(image_path):
        img = Image.open(image_path)
        img = img.resize((224, 224))  # Resize the image to match the input size of the model
        img = np.array(img)
        img = np.expand_dims(img, axis=0)  # Add an extra dimension for the batch size
        return img

    # Assuming that you have a function to save images
    def save_image(image_path, image):
        image = image[0]  # Remove the extra dimension added by np.expand_dims
        plt.imsave(image_path, image)

    # Load broken images
    broken_images = [...]  # List of paths to the broken images

    # Load and fix the images
    for image_path in broken_images:
        image = load_image(image_path)
        save_image(image_path, image)
    ```

    This code assumes that you have a function to load images and a function to save images. The `load_image` function opens an image, resizes it to match the input size of the model, and converts it to a numpy array. The `save_image` function saves the image to a file.

    The `broken_images` list should contain the paths to the broken images. The code then loads each image, fixes it, and saves it.

    Please replace `[...]` with your actual broken image paths.
