    ## SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED
    ## This error occurs when the SSL certificate of the server is not valid or not trusted.
    ## To fix this issue, you need to install a valid SSL certificate on your server.
    ## If you are using a third-party server, you might need to contact your hosting provider to get a valid SSL certificate.
    ## If you are using a local server, you can use a self-signed SSL certificate.
    ## In Python, you can use the ssl module to create a self-signed certificate.
    ## Here is an example:

    ```python
    import ssl
    import socket

    # Create a self-signed certificate
    context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_SERVER)
    context.load_cert_chain('certfile.pem', 'keyfile.pem')

    # Create a server socket
    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM, 0)
    server_socket.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
    server_socket.bind(('localhost', 8443))
    server_socket.listen(5)

    # Accept a client connection
    client_socket, fromaddr = server_socket.accept()
    context.wrap_socket(client_socket, server_side=True)

    # Get the certificate details
    cert = client_socket.getpeercert()
    print(f"Certificate details: {cert}")
    ```

    ## After creating the certificate, you can use it to run your server.
    ## Remember to replace 'certfile.pem' and 'keyfile.pem' with the paths to your actual certificate and key files.

    ## Please note that this is a very basic example and in a real-world scenario, you would need to handle more cases, such as handling multiple clients, managing connections, etc.

    ## Also, this code will not work if you are running it on a server that is not configured to use SSL.
