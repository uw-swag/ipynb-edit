    The provided code is a Jupyter notebook that uses Dash, a Python framework for building web applications, to create a dashboard for visualizing flight delay time statistics. The dashboard allows users to input a year and see the average delay times for different airline carriers, weather conditions, NAS, security, and late aircraft delays.

    The `compute_info` function is used to compute the average delay times for each airline carrier, weather condition, NAS, security, and late aircraft delay for a given year. The `get_graph` function is used as the callback function, which is called whenever the user inputs a new year in the input field. This function computes the required information and returns a list of figures, each representing a different delay time category.

    The dashboard is then run using the `app.run_server` method, which starts the server and opens the dashboard in a new browser tab.

    The dashboard is interactive, so the user can zoom in and out, hover over data points, and interact with the plots. The user can also change the year input to see the changes in the delay times for different airline carriers, weather conditions, NAS, security, and late aircraft delays.

    The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly and easy to understand, with clear instructions and visualizations.
