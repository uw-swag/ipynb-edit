```python
    from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

    smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
    X_res, y_res = smote.fit_resample(X, y)
    ```
    The `SMOTE` function from the `imblearn` library is used to handle the imbalance in the dataset. The `fit_resample` function is used to apply the SMOTE algorithm to the dataset. The `random_state` parameter is set to 42 to ensure that the results are reproducible.
