```python
    import tqdm

    for i in tqdm.tqdm(range(100)):
        time.sleep(0.01)  # simulate a long-running task
    ```

    This code will create a progress bar that updates in real-time as the loop runs.

    Please note that the `tqdm` library is not a part of the standard Python library. You need to install it using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install tqdm
    ```

    Also, the `time.sleep(0.01)` is a very simple way to simulate a long-running task. In a real-world application, you would likely use a more sophisticated method to measure the time taken by the task.
