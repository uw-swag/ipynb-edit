    The mini-batch K-Means performance comparison diagram is a visualization of the performance of the K-Means algorithm in different scenarios. The x-axis represents the number of clusters (K), and the y-axis represents the ratio of the inertia to the time taken to fit the model.

    The plot shows that the performance of the K-Means algorithm is notably affected by the choice of the number of clusters (K) and the mini-batch size (the number of samples used in each iteration of the fit method). The inertia (sum of squared distances) is a measure of the total within-cluster sum of squares, and the time taken to fit the model is a measure of the computational cost.

    The plot also shows that the performance of the mini-batch K-Means algorithm is generally better than the K-Means algorithm for large datasets, but it can be slower and more memory-intensive than the K-Means algorithm.
