The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses TensorFlow and Keras to train a model on a binary classification task. The notebook includes several cells for data preparation, model building, training, evaluation, and prediction.

Here's a brief explanation of each cell:

1. `dhtml(str)`: This function is used to display HTML content. It's used to display text in a HTML format.

2. `import warnings; warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')`: This line is used to ignore all warnings that are not errors.

3. `import tensorflow as tf,pylab as pl,numpy as np`: These lines are used to import the necessary libraries.

4. `import tensorflow.keras.layers as tkl`: This line is used to import the layers from the keras library.

5. `import tensorflow_datasets as tfds`: This line is used to import the tensorflow datasets library.

6. `@register_line_magic`: This is a Jupyter notebook magic command that allows you to use a line magic command in a cell.

7. `make_XOR(N)`: This function is used to generate a XOR dataset.

8. `display_data(data)`: This function is used to display the data.

9. `display_predictions(data)`: This function is used to display the predictions.

10. `train_input_fn(x_train,y_train,batch_size)`: This function is used to create a training input function.

11. `valid_input_fn(x_valid,y_valid,batch_size)`: This function is used to create a validation input function.

12. `test_input_fn(x_test,y_test,batch_size)`: This function is used to create a test input function.

13. `train_valid(pars)`: This function is used to train and evaluate the model.

14. `model=tf.keras.Sequential([...])`: This line is used to create a sequential model.

15. `model.compile(optim
