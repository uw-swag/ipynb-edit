    # You can add files via the upload feature in the Jupyter notebook.
    # Here is an example of how to do it:

    # First, you need to upload the file. You can do this by clicking on the "Upload" button in the toolbar at the top of the notebook.
    # Then, you can add the file to your notebook by using the following code:

    from IPython.display import FileUploader

    uploader = FileUploader()
    uploader

    # After the file is uploaded, you can use the following code to add the file to your notebook:

    uploaded = uploader.files.values()
    for file in uploaded:
        display(file)
        with open(file.name, 'wb') as f:
            f.write(file.data.read())

    # Now, the file is in your notebook and you can use it as you would any other file.
    # For example, you can read the file and display its content:

    with open('my_file.txt', 'r') as f:
        print(f.read())

    # You can also use the `display` function to display the content of the file:

    display(FileLines(filename='my_file.txt'))

    # You can also use the `display` function to display the content of the file as HTML:

    display(HTML(filename='my_file.txt'))

    # You can also use the `display` function to display the content of the file as a plot:

    display(plot(filename='my_file.txt'))

    # You can also use the `display` function to display the content of the file as a table:

    display(Table(filename='my_file.txt'))

    # You can also use the `display` function to display the content of the file as a markdown cell:

    display(Markdown(filename='my_file.txt'))

    # You can also use the `display` function to display the content of the file as a code cell:

    display(Code(filename='my_file.txt'))

    # You can also use the
