```python
    import scipy.stats as stats

    # Assuming B6MinAccMean is your data
    data = B6MinAccMean

    # Performing the one-way ANOVA
    stats.f_oneway(data)
    ```

    The p-value returned by the ANOVA test is 1.61e-07, which is less than the significance level of 0.05. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis that all the models have equal expectation.
