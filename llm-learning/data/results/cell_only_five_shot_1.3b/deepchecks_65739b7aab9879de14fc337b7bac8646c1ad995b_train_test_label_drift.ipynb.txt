    In the above GitHub action, we are setting up a job named "links-check" that runs on the latest version of Ubuntu. The job first checks out the code, then sets up Python 3.8, and then installs the dependencies. Finally, it runs the links_check script.

    Please replace `links_check` with the actual script name that you have in your project.

    Also, replace `requirements.txt` with the actual file name that contains the list of dependencies for your project.

    The `links_check` script should be a Python script that checks the links in the code.

    Please note that the `links_check` script should be written in a way that it can be run from the command line.

    The `links_check` script should be able to handle different types of links (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc.) and different types of URLs (e.g., relative, absolute, etc.).

    The `links_check` script should be able to handle different types of errors (e.g., HTTP errors, URL not found, etc.) and different types of exceptions (e.g., HTTPError, URLError, etc.).

    The `links_check` script should be able to handle different types of URLs (e.g., relative, absolute, etc.) and different types of parameters (e.g., query parameters, fragment identifier, etc.).

    The `links_check` script should be able to handle different types of HTTP methods (e.g., GET,
