    ### 1. Introduction

    The purpose of this notebook is to assist in the peer assignment process for the course "Data Science for Business". The assignment involves the use of various data science techniques to analyze and interpret business data.

    ### 2. Data Collection

    The first step in any data science project is to collect the data. In this case, we will be using the Avocado dataset, which is a dataset of global average prices of avocados sold in a variety of regions, and the date they were sold.

    ### 3. Data Cleaning

    The data collected from the Avocado dataset needs to be cleaned. This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring the data is in the correct format.

    ### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis

    The cleaned data is then analyzed to understand the patterns, trends, and correlations in the data. This will help in understanding the data better and identifying any potential issues.

    ### 5. Feature Engineering

    Features are engineered from the cleaned data. This involves creating new features that might be useful in predicting the price of avocados.

    ### 6. Model Building

    A machine learning model is built using the features engineered. This could be a regression model, a classification model, or a clustering model. The choice of model depends on the nature of the data and the problem at hand.

    ### 7. Model Evaluation

    The model is evaluated using appropriate metrics. This includes metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

    ### 8. Conclusion

    The final step in the process is to summarize the results
