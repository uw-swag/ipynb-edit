    ## Documentation and Readme

    ### Overview
    This project is a part of the MMTF (Molecular Machine Translation Framework) project, which is a collaboration between the University of California, Santa Cruz, and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences.

    The MMTF project aims to develop a comprehensive framework for the translation of molecular structures. The project is designed to be a collaborative effort between scientists from diverse fields, including molecular biology, computer science, and materials science.

    The project is currently in the early stages of development, and the current version of the MMTF framework is still in its early stages. The project is being developed in collaboration with the University of California, Santa Cruz, and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences.

    ### Getting Started
    To get started with the MMTF project, you will need to install the necessary software and dependencies. The project is designed to be a collaborative effort and requires a strong understanding of molecular biology, computer science, and materials science.

    ### Features
    The MMTF project currently offers the following features:

    - Structure translation: The project is designed to translate molecular structures from one format to another.
    - Structure annotation: The project is also designed to annotate molecular structures with information from other sources.
    - Structure visualization: The project provides tools to visualize molecular structures.

    ### Roadmap
    The MMTF project is still in its early stages and is not yet ready for widespread use. The project is being developed in collaboration with the University of California, Santa Cruz, and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences.

    ### Contributing
    We welcome contributions from anyone interested in the MMTF project. Please refer to the contributing guidelines for more information.
