```
    The code you provided is a tutorial on using the SQLiteTracker library in Python. The SQLiteTracker library is a simple and efficient way to track and manage experiments in Python.

    The code is divided into two parts:

    1. The first part is a simple demonstration of how to use the SQLiteTracker library to track the performance of different machine learning models on the iris dataset.

    2. The second part is a more complex example. It demonstrates how to use the SQLiteTracker library to track the performance of a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model.

    The code also includes a comment that explains the purpose of the SQLiteTracker library.

    The final part of the code is a query that retrieves the best performing model from the tracked experiments.

    Please note that the SQLiteTracker library is not included in the standard Python library, so you will need to install it using pip:

    ```
    pip install SQLiteTracker
    ```

    Also, make sure to replace the 'experiments' table in the SQLite database with the actual name of your table.

    Finally, the code assumes that you have a SQLite database set up and that you have the necessary permissions to create and read from the 'experiments' table.

    Please let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
