    Here is the updated code with the dataset properties updated:

    ```python
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    from torch.utils.data import Dataset

    # Assuming df_train and df_test are your dataframes
    df_train, df_test = train_test_split(df_train, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Adding a random label to the train dataset
    label = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(df_train.shape[0],))
    df_train['target'] = label

    # Creating the train dataset
    train_dataset = Dataset(df_train, label='target')

    # Adding a random label to the test dataset
    label = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(df_test.shape[0],))
    df_test['target'] = label

    # Creating the test dataset
    test_dataset = Dataset(df_test, label='target')
    ```

    This code splits the data into a training set and a test set, adds a random label to the training set, and then creates the training and test datasets. The label is a binary random number, which is used as the target variable in the model.
