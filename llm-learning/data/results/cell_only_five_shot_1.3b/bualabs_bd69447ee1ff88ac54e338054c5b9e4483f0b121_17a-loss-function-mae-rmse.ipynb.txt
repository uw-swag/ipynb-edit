    ### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

    MAE is the mean absolute error of a regression model. It is the mean of the absolute value of the errors.

    ```python
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

    y_true = [3, -0.5, 2, 7]
    y_pred = [2.5, 0.0, 2, 8]

    mae = mean_absolute_error(y_true, y_pred)
    print('Mean Absolute Error:', mae)
    ```

    ### Mean Squared Error (MSE)

    MSE is the mean squared error of a regression model. It is the mean of the squared errors.

    ```python
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

    y_true = [3, -0.5, 2, 7]
    y_pred = [2.5, 0.0, 2, 8]

    mse = mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred)
    print('Mean Squared Error:', mse)
    ```

    ### Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

    RMSE is the root mean squared error of a regression model. It is the square root of the mean of the squared errors.

    ```python
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
    from math import sqrt

    y_true = [3, -0.5, 2, 7]
    y_pred = [2.5, 0.0, 2, 8]

    rmse = sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred))
    print('Root Mean Squared Error:', rmse)
    ```

    ### R Squared (R²)

    R² is the coefficient of determination. It is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model.
