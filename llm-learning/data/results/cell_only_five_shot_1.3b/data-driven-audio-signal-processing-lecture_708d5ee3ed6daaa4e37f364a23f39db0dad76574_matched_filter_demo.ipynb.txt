```python
    from skimage import filters
    from skimage.feature import match_descriptors
    from skimage.transform import pyramid_gaussian_filter

    # Load the image
    image = io.imread('image.jpg', plugin='matplotlib')

    # Apply a Gaussian filter to the image
    image_pyramid = pyramid_gaussian_filter(image, sigma=3)

    # Detect the keypoints in the image
    keypoints = detect_keypoints(image_pyramid)

    # Compute the descriptors for the keypoints
    descriptors = compute_descriptors(keypoints, image)

    # Match the descriptors with a reference image
    matches = match_descriptors(descriptors, reference_image, cross_check=True)

    # Draw the matches on the image
    draw_matches(image, keypoints, matches)

    # Show the result
    plt.imshow(image)
    plt.show()
    ```
    This code uses the `skimage` library to perform pattern detection and matching. The `detect_keypoints`, `compute_descriptors`, and `match_descriptors` functions are used to detect keypoints, compute descriptors, and match descriptors respectively. The `draw_matches` function is used to draw the matches on the image.
