    The code you provided is for a machine learning pipeline using Kernel PCA and Logistic Regression. It's a good example of how to use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. However, it's important to note that the sklearn version you're using (0.18) is quite old.

    The recommended way to handle this is to use the newer versions of scikit-learn, which have better support for cross-validation and grid search. Here's how you can do it:

    ```python
    from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, cross_val_score
    from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
    from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_mldata

    mnist = fetch_mldata('MNIST original')
    X = mnist["data"]
    y = mnist["target"]

    clf = Pipeline([
        ("kpca", PCA(n_components=2)),
        ("log_reg", LogisticRegression())
    ])

    param_grid = [
        {"kpca__gamma": np.linspace(0.03, 0.05, 10), "kpca__kernel": ["rbf", "sigmoid"]}
    ]

    grid_search = GridSearchCV(clf, param_grid, cv=3)
    grid_search.fit(X, y)

    print(grid_search.best_params_)
    ```

    This will give you the best parameters found by the grid search, which should be more accurate and faster.
