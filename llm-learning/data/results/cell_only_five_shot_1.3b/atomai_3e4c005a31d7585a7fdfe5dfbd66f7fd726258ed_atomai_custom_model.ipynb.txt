```python
    # Download into VM storage
    !wget -O "graphene_MD_imgs.npy" https://www.dropbox.com/s/r2cz8jqc9m19gaj/cropped_images_new.npy?dl=1
    # download data
    !wget -O "graphene_exp.npy" https://www.dropbox.com/s/33uo35z4siiy2y4/Gr_SiCr.npy?dl=1
    ```

    ### Explanation:
    The code above is used to download two files from Dropbox. The first file is named "graphene_MD_imgs.npy" and it's a numpy array that contains the images. The second file is named "graphene_exp.npy" and it's a numpy array that contains the experimental data.

    The `!wget` command is used to download the files. The `-O` option is used to specify the output file name. The `https://www.dropbox.com/s/r2cz8jqc9m19gaj/cropped_images_new.npy?dl=1` and `https://www.dropbox.com/s/33uo35z4siiy2y4/Gr_SiCr.npy?dl=1` are the URLs of the files to be downloaded.

    The `?dl=1` at the end of the URL is a query string that instructs Dropbox to download the file directly to your current directory.

    The `?dl=1` is a query string that instructs Dropbox to download the file directly to your current directory.

    The `?dl=1` is a query string that instructs Dropbox to download the file directly to your current directory.

    The `?dl=1` is a query string that instructs Dropbox to download the file directly to your current directory.

    The `?dl=1` is a query string that instructs Dropbox to download the file directly to your current directory.

    The `?dl=1` is a query string that instructs Drop
