    The code you provided is a complete Python script for a machine learning project. It includes data loading, data visualization, model training, and prediction.

    The script uses the logistic regression model for binary classification. The data is loaded from a file, visualized, and the model is trained using gradient descent. The model's weights are then printed, and a plot of the loss over iterations is shown.

    The script also demonstrates how to use the trained model to predict the class of new data.

    The script also demonstrates how to use the logistic regression model for a classification task in the iris dataset.
