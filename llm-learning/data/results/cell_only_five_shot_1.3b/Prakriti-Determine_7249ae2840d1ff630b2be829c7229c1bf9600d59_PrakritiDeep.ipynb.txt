    # New feature: Handling chats more accurately
    def handle_chats(self, chat_id, message):
        # Implement the chat handling logic here
        pass

    # New feature: Improving the code

    ## Code Explanation:

    The `sleep_messages` function is a new feature that allows the bot to sleep for a specified number of seconds. This can be useful for creating delays in the bot's response.

    The `handle_chats` function is a new feature that allows the bot to handle chats more accurately. This function should contain the logic for handling the chat messages.

    The `improve_code` function is a new feature that allows the bot to improve the code. This function should contain the logic for improving the code.

    Please note that these are just examples of new features. The actual implementation of these features would depend on the specific requirements of your bot.
