    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the folium library to create maps. The notebook is divided into four sections:

    1. Mounting Google Drive and downloading a dataset from Kaggle.
    2. Creating a base map with plate boundaries.
    3. Adding a heatmap to the map.
    4. Adding a map to visualize earthquake depth.

    Each section is followed by a comment explaining what the code does.

    The number of cores set in the SparkConf is set to 4 to avoid any issues with the Binder service.

    The notebook ends with a final section that creates a choropleth map to visualize population density.

    The notebook also includes a final section that creates a map to visualize earthquake depth and population density.
