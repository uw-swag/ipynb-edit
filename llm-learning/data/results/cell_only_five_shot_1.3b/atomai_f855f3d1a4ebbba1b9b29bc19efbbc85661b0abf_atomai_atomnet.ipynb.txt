    ### Response:
    Here is the updated code with the new feature "User Management". This feature allows the user to create, read, update, and delete users in a database.

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

    # Load data
    data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

    # Split data into features and target variable
    X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
    y = data['target']
