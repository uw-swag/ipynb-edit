    This is a Jupyter notebook written in Python. It includes several code cells, each of which is a part of a larger task. Here's a brief overview of what each cell does:

1. The first cell imports several necessary libraries. It uses the pandas library for data manipulation, the matplotlib and seaborn libraries for data visualization, and the sklearn library for machine learning models.

2. The second cell defines a function `get_is_gum` that checks if a faculty name is related to the "Gumманитарий" (a term used to describe a group of people who are interested in a particular topic).

3. The third cell uses a for loop to iterate over a list of dictionaries, each containing information about a user. It removes certain keys from each dictionary, adds new keys to them, and then adds the modified dictionary to a new list.

4. The fourth cell writes the names of universities with more than 4 faculty members to a file named 'ing.txt'.

5. The fifth cell reads the names of faculty members from the 'ing.txt' file and counts the number of times each name appears.

6. The sixth cell writes the names of faculty members that are not related to the "Gumманитарий" to a file named 'gum.txt'.

7. The seventh cell uses seaborn to create a count plot of the hours of the day.

8. The eighth cell drops any rows in the DataFrame that have an empty 'text' field.

9. The ninth cell writes the DataFrame to a CSV file named 'data/comments.csv.gz'.

10. The tenth cell imports a function from a module named 'module_name'.

11. The eleventh cell uses a for loop to iterate over a list of dictionaries, each containing information about a user. It removes certain keys from each dictionary, adds new keys to them, and then adds the modified dictionary to a new list.

12. The twelfth cell writes the names of universities with more than 4 faculty members to a file named 'ing__.txt'.

13. The thirteenth cell writes the names of faculty members that are not related to the "Gumманитарий" to a file named 'g
