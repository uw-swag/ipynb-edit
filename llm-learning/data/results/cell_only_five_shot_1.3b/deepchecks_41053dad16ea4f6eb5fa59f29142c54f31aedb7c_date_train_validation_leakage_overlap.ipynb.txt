```python
    from deepchecks.checks.methodology import DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap
    from deepchecks.base import Dataset, Suite
    from datetime import datetime
    import pandas as pd

    def dataset_from_dict(d: dict, date_name: str = None) -> Dataset:
        dataframe = pd.DataFrame(data=d)
        if date_name:
            dataframe[date_name] = pd.to_datetime(dataframe[date_name])
        return Dataset(dataframe)

    # Create a dataset
    d = {'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'B': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], 'C': [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]}
    dataset = dataset_from_dict(d, 'date')

    # Create a suite
    suite = Suite(datasets=[dataset])

    # Add a check
    suite.add_check(DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap(date_col='date'))

    # Run the suite
    results = suite.run()

    # Print the results
    print(results)
    ```

    This code will create a dataset from a dictionary, add a check for leakage overlap, and then run the suite. The results will be printed to the console.

    Please note that the `DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap` check is not included in the DeepChecks library. You may need to implement it yourself or find a third-party library that provides this check.
