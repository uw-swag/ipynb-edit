    ### Response:
    To add an image of the KNN algorithm, you can use the matplotlib library in Python. Here's how you can do it:

    ```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Assuming that the iris dataset is loaded into the variable iris
    from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

    iris = load_iris()
    X = iris.data
    y = iris.target

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
    knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)

    print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_
