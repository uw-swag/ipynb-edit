The caching strategy in the provided code is not explicitly mentioned. However, it's important to note that caching is a key feature of many machine learning pipelines, including those in the provided code. 

In the context of the code, the caching strategy is used to store the trained model and its associated metadata (like the framework, dataset size, and accuracy) in a cache. This can be useful for performance optimization, as it allows the model to be reused without needing to retrain it.

However, without a specific caching strategy mentioned, it's hard to provide a more detailed explanation. If you could provide more details about the caching strategy you're using, I would be happy to help further.
