```python
    from google.cloud import storage

    def upload_blob(bucket_name, source_file_name, destination_blob_name):
        """Uploads a file to the bucket."""
        storage_client = storage.Client()
        bucket = storage_client.bucket(bucket_name)
        blob = bucket.blob(destination_blob_name)

        blob.upload_from_filename(source_file_name)

        print(
            "File {} uploaded to {}.".format(
                source_file_name, destination_blob_name
            )
        )
    ```
    This function uploads a file to a Google Cloud Storage bucket. The `bucket_name` is the name of the bucket, `source_file_name` is the path to the file you want to upload, and `destination_blob_name` is the name you want to give to the uploaded file in the bucket.

    You can use this function like this:

    ```python
    upload_blob('my_bucket', 'local/path/to/my_file.txt', 'my_blob_name')
    ```

    This will upload the file `local/path/to/my_file.txt` to the bucket `my_bucket` with the blob name `my_blob_name`.
