```python
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Generate some data
    x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
    y = np.sin(x)

    # Plot the data
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.plot(x, y, label='sin(x)')
    plt.xlabel('x')
    plt.ylabel('y')
    plt.title('Sine wave')
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()

    ### Response:
    The code you provided is already scaling the data. The `plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))` line is setting the size of the figure to 10 units wide and 6 units high. This is a common practice when creating plots to ensure they are properly scaled.

    However, if you're experiencing issues with the scaling, it could be due to a variety of factors. Here are a few things you could try:

    1. Check the data: Ensure that the data you're plotting is within the range that the scaling function can handle. If the data is too large, it could cause overflow.

    2. Check the scaling function: If you're
