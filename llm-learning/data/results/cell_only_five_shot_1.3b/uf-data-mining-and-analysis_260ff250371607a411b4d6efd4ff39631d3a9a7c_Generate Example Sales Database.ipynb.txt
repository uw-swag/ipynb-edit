    ## Introduction
    This document provides an overview of the project.

    ## Data
    The data used in this project is the sequences10k dataset, which contains 10,000 protein sequences. The sequences are encoded as integers, where each integer represents the amino acid (Amino-acid) that the sequence corresponds to.

    ## Methods
    The methods used in this project are:
    1. Data preprocessing: Removing missing positions, converting numeric sequences to amino-acid sequences.
    2. Feature selection: Selecting the most significant amino-acids from the sequences.
    3. Model training: Training a machine learning model to predict the optimal growth temperature of a source-organism.

    ## Results
    The results of this project are:
    1. The most significant amino-acids are identified and used to train a machine learning model to predict the optimal growth temperature of a source-organism.
    2. The model's performance is evaluated using the sequences10k dataset.
