    The code provided is a major update to the NLP-based feature engineering process. Here's a brief overview of what has been updated:

    1. **Common Libraries**: The libraries used in the code have been updated to the latest versions. This includes `nltk`, `gensim`, `textstat`, `nltk.corpus`, `spacy`, `sklearn`, and `pandas`.

    2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The data is loaded from a JSON file and preprocessed to remove any irrelevant or redundant information. The data is split into training and testing sets, and the target variable is defined.

    3. **Text Cleaning**: The text data is cleaned by removing any unnecessary characters, numbers, or symbols. Stopwords are removed from the text data.

    4. **Feature Extraction**: The text data is further processed to extract various features such as word count, character count, average word length, number of digits, uppercase letters, and punctuation marks.

    5. **Feature Engineering**: The text data is further processed to create various features such as Flesch-Kincaid Grade, Polarity, and Subjectivity.

    6. **Part of Speech (POS) and Dependency Parsing**: The text data is further processed to extract POS tags and dependency parsing.

    7. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: The text data is further processed to extract named entities.

    8. **Word Clouds**: Word clouds are created to visualize the most common words in the text data.

    9. **Sentiment Analysis**: The text data is further processed to perform sentiment analysis.

    10. **Feature Selection**: The features are selected using various techniques such as Chi-Square, Recursive Feature Elimination, and Lasso Regression.

    11. **Model Training and Evaluation**: The text data is further processed to train a Naive Bayes classifier and evaluate its performance.

    12. **Word2Vec Model**: A Word2Vec model is trained on the text data to generate word embeddings.

    13. **Feature Creation**: New
