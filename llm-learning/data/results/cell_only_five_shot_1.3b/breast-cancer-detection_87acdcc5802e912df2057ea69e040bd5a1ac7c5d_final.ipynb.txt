```python
    from xgboost import XGBClassifier

    # Initialize XGBoost classifier
    xgb_clf = XGBClassifier(use_label_encoder=False, eval_metric='mlogloss')

    # Fit the model
    xgb_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Predict on the test set
    y_pred = xgb_clf.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model
    print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
    ```
    This code cell implements an optimized XGBoost Classifier for improved model performance. The classifier is initialized, then fitted to the training data. The model is then used to make predictions on the test set, and the results are evaluated.
