The code you've provided is a function call that checks for feature drift in a machine learning model. The function `TrainTestFeatureDrift().add_condition_drift_score_not_greater_than()` is used to check if the feature drift score is greater than a certain threshold. If the score is not greater than the threshold, the function will return True, indicating that the feature drift is detected.

However, the code you've provided is not a complete Jupyter notebook. It's a part of a larger code snippet. If you're looking to add a new notebook, you would need to provide the complete code.

If you're looking to add a new notebook, you can do so by following these steps:

1. Open your Jupyter notebook.
2. Click on the "New" button in the menu bar.
3. Select "Python 3" and then "Notebook".
4. Give your notebook a name and click "Create".

After creating a new notebook, you can add your code to it. Remember to save your work regularly, as Jupyter notebooks are interactive and you can modify your code as you go along.
