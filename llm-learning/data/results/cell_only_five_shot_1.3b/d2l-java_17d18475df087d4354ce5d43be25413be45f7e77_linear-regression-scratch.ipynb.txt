    The above Maven commands are used to add the new versions of the dependencies to the Maven repository.

    The first line is for the snapshot repository, which is used for testing and development. The second line is for the release repository, which is used for production.

    The `%maven` command is used to add a new dependency to the Maven repository. The first argument is the group id of the dependency, the second argument is the artifact id of the dependency, and the third argument is the version of the dependency.

    The `%mavenRepo` command is used to specify the repository URL. In this case, the snapshot repository is specified as `https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/`, and the release repository is specified as `https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/`.

    The `%maven` commands are repeated for each dependency, with the version number updated to `0.8.0-SNAPSHOT`.

    Please note that you need to have the necessary permissions to add dependencies to the Maven repository.
