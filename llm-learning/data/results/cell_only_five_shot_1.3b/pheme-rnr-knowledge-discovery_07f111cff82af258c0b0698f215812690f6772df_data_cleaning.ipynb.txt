```python
    ## Changed the word 'error' to 'accuracy' in classification models.ipynb

    ## Accuracy is a more accurate measure of a model's performance.
    ## It's the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions.

    ## Accuracy is a good measure to evaluate the performance of a classification model,
    ## but it's not always the best metric to use for regression models.
    ## For example, in a dataset where the target variable is a continuous value,
    ## accuracy might not be the best metric to use.

    ## In such cases, other metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE),
    ## or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) can be more appropriate.

    ## These metrics provide a more balanced perspective on the model's performance.
    ## For example, MAE gives an idea of how wrong the predictions were,
    ## while MSE and RMSE give an idea of how far off the predictions were.

    ## Therefore, it's important to use a metric that's appropriate for the problem at hand.
