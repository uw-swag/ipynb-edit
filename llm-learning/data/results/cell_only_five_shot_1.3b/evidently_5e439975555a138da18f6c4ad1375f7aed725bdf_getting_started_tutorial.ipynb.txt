    The code you provided is a Python script for getting started with the Evidently library, a Python library for creating and evaluating data-driven insights.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    1. Import necessary libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, evidently.

    2. Fetch the California housing dataset from sklearn.datasets.

    3. Define a ColumnMapping object to specify the column mapping for the report.

    4. Create a Report object and run it with the reference and current data.

    5. Create a TestSuite object and add the tests for data stability and target drift.

    6. Run the tests and print the report.

    7. Create a TestSuite object and add the tests for checking the number of columns with missing values, rows with missing values, constant columns, duplicated rows, duplicated columns, column type, and number of drifted columns.

    8. Run the tests and print the results.

    The code is a good starting point for anyone looking to use Evidently for data-driven insights.
