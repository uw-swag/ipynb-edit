```
    import matplotlib.image as mpimg

img = mpimg.imread('my_square_function.png')
print img.shape, img.dtype
img = np.arange(100*100).reshape(100, 100)
print img
plt.imshow(img)
plt.show()
```

    The code is already compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3. The `imread` function from `matplotlib.image` is available in both Python 2 and Python 3. The `np.arange` and `reshape` functions are also available in both Python 2 and Python 3. The `plt.imshow` function is also available in both Python 2 and Python 3.
