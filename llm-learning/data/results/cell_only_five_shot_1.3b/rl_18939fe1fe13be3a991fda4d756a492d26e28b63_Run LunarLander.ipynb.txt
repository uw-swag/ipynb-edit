    The code you provided is a Python implementation of the REINFORCE (Reinforcement Learning) algorithm, which is a method for training agents to perform an action in an environment. The agent learns to perform the action by taking actions in the environment and observing the results.

    The code is divided into several sections:

    1. The `REINFORCE_Agent` class is defined, which is a subclass of the `Agent` class from the `nannyml` library. The class is used to create an agent that can perform actions in an environment.

    2. The `__init__` method initializes the agent with various parameters, such as the state size, action size, learning rate, discount rate, number of hidden layers, hidden layer size, activation function, regularization penalty, dropout rate, filename, and verbosity.

    3. The `reset` method is used to reset the agent's state.

    4. The `build_model` method is used to build the model for the agent. The model is a deep neural network with a custom loss function.

    5. The `act` method is used to select an action based on the current state.

    6. The `remember` method is used to store the state, action, and reward.

    7. The `train` method is used to train the agent. It first standardizes the discounted rewards, then trains the model using the standardized rewards.

    8. The `save` and `load` methods are used to save and load the agent's model.

    9. The `env` variable is used to create an environment, and the `agent` variable is used to create an agent.

    The code also uses the `gym` library to create an environment and the `nannyml` library to create an agent.

    The code is a simple implementation of the REINFORCE algorithm, and it may not be suitable for all environments or problems. It is a good starting point for understanding the REINFORCE algorithm and how to implement it in a custom environment.

    Please note that the code provided is a simplified version of the REINFORCE algorithm. The actual implementation of the algorithm may require more complex code and may not work as expected.
