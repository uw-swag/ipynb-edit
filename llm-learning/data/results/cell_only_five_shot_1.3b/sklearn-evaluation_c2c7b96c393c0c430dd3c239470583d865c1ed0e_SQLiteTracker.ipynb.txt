```python
    import uuid

    # Generate a new UUID
    new_uuid = uuid.uuid4()

    # Assign the new UUID to the tracker
    tracker["580339db"] = new_uuid
    tracker["99888ef3"] = new_uuid

    # Now, the tracker should have a new UUID assigned to each of the original UUIDs
    one = tracker.get("580339db")
    another = tracker.get("99888ef3")

    # Check if the UUIDs are different
    if one != another:
        print("UUIDs are different")
    else:
        print("UUIDs are the same")
    ```
    This code will generate a new UUID and assign it to the tracker dictionary. The tracker dictionary now contains two keys, each with a different UUID. The UUIDs are different because the UUIDs are generated randomly.
