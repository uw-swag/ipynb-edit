    Here is a reduced version of your code. I've removed the unnecessary variables and functions, and replaced them with more readable and concise code.

```python
from torch.optim import SGD

num_epochs = 500
lr = 1

# Assuming 'net', 'dataset', 'vocab', 'device', and 'manager' are defined elsewhere in your code
# And 'trainCh8' is a function that takes these parameters and trains a model

optimizer = SGD(net.parameters(), lr=lr)

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in dataset:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = net(batch)
        loss = loss_function(output, target)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

This version of the code is more concise, but it's still the same as your original code. The `trainCh8` function is not used in this version, and the `loss_function` and `net` variables are not defined in this version. You'll need to replace these with your actual variables and functions.
