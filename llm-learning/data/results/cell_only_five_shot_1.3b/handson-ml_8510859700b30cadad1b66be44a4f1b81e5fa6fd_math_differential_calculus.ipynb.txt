    ### Part 1: Derivatives

    #### Derivative of a function
    # Let's consider a function f(x) = x^2. Its derivative is given by f'(x) = 2x.

    def derivative_of_f(x):
        return 2*x

    #### Derivative of a function with respect to x
    # If we have a function f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2, its derivative with respect to x is given by f'(x) = 2x.

    def derivative_of_f_with_respect_to_x(x, y):
        return 2*x

    #### Derivative of a function with respect to y
    # If we have a function f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2, its derivative with respect to y is given by f'(y) = 2y.

    def derivative_of_f_with_respect_to_y(x, y):
        return 2*y

    ### Part 2: Integrals

    #### Integral of a function
    # Let's consider a function f(x) = x^2. Its integral is given by int(f(x)) = x^3/3.

    def integral_of_f(x):
        return (x**3)/3

    #### Integral of a function with respect to x
    # If we have a function f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2, its integral with respect to x is given by int(f(x)) = x^3/3.

    def integral_of_f_with_respect_to_x(x, y):
        return (x**3)/3

    #### Integral of a function with respect to y
    # If we have a function f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2, its integral with respect to y is given by int(f(y)) = y^3/3.

    def integral_of_f_with_respect_to_y(x,
