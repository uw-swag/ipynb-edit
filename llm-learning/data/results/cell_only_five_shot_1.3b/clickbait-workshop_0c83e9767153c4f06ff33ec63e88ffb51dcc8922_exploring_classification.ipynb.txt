    ## Exploration Notebook

    ## Overview
    This notebook is designed to explore the Multinomial Variational Autoencoder (MVAE) model. MVAE is a type of autoencoder model that is specifically designed to work with categorical data.

    ## Importing Libraries
    We will be using the following libraries:
    - `numpy` for numerical computations
    - `pandas` for data manipulation
    - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
    - `sklearn` for machine learning
    - `keras` for building the MVAE model
    - `tensorflow` for training the MVAE model

    ## Data Preprocessing
    We will be using the `pandas` library to preprocess the data. The data will be split into training and testing sets.

    ## Building the MVAE Model
    The MVAE model is built using the `keras` library. The model is composed of two parts: the encoder and the decoder. The encoder part is responsible for encoding the categorical data into a latent space, and the decoder part is responsible for reconstructing the original categorical data from the latent space.

    ## Training the MVAE Model
    The MVAE model is trained using the `tensorflow` library. The model is trained for a number of epochs.

    ## Exploring the Results
    The results of the model are explored. This includes visualizing the latent space, comparing the reconstruction error of the model, and comparing the performance of the model with a baseline model.

    ## Conclusion
    The MVAE model is a powerful tool for dealing with categorical data. It can be used to create a more robust and accurate model for classification tasks.

    ## Further Work
    The MVAE model can be further improved by experimenting with different architectures, hyperparameters, and techniques.
