## 1. Introduction

Vision is a comprehensive platform for building, training, and deploying machine learning models. It provides a wide range of features, including data preprocessing, model training, and model deployment. Vision is designed to be user-friendly, allowing users to easily perform data preprocessing, model training, and model deployment.

## 2. Getting Started

To get started with Vision, you need to install the Vision library. You can do this using pip:

```python
pip install vision
```

After installation, you can start using Vision by importing the necessary modules:

```python
from vision.data_preprocessing import DataPreprocessor
from vision.model_training import ModelTrainer
from vision.model_deployment import ModelDeployer
```

## 3. Data Preprocessing

Vision provides a DataPreprocessor class that allows you to preprocess your data. This class includes methods for handling missing values, outlier detection, and normalization.

Here's an example of how to use the DataPreprocessor:

```python
data_preprocessor = DataPreprocessor()
preprocessed_data = data_preprocessor.preprocess(raw_data)
```

## 4. Model Training

Vision provides a ModelTrainer class that allows you to train your model. This class includes methods for model selection, training, and evaluation.

Here's an example of how to use the ModelTrainer:

```python
model_trainer = ModelTrainer()
trained_model = model_trainer.train(preprocessed_data, model_config)
```

## 5. Model Evaluation

Vision provides a ModelEvaluator class that allows
