    The code you provided is a test for a recommendation system using the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm. The ALS algorithm is a popular collaborative filtering algorithm that is used to make predictions about the interests of a user by collecting preferences from many users.

    The code is divided into several steps:

    1. It imports necessary libraries and modules.
    2. It downloads the MovieLens 100k dataset from the internet.
    3. It preprocesses the data by cleaning it, converting it into a suitable format, and splitting it into training and testing sets.
    4. It creates a pivot table from the training data, which is a matrix where each row represents a user and each column represents a movie.
    5. It trains the ALS model on the pivot table.
    6. It makes recommendations for the first 471 users in the test set and the remaining users.
    7. It evaluates the performance of the recommendations using several metrics.

    The code uses the `evidently` library to create a report of the performance of the recommendations.

    Please note that the code provided is a basic example and may not work as expected. It is recommended to run this code in a suitable environment to get a more accurate and reliable recommendation system.
