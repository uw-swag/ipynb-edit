    The function `read_and_store_data` is designed to read and store data from an EDf (Electroencephalogram) file. The data is read in chunks, and each chunk is stored in a numpy array. The function also handles seizure detection and marking the corresponding records in the data.

    The function `readEdfFile` is used to read an EDf file and return a numpy array containing the data.

    The function `get_seizure_period` is a helper function that is used to identify the start and length of a seizure in an EDf file.

    The function `read_and_store_data` returns a pandas DataFrame containing the data read from the EDf files. The DataFrame is sorted by patient and by seizure.

    The DataFrame is then saved to a CSV file.

    The function `read_and_store_data` is called with the path to the dataset folder, the sample rate, and the number of channels.

    The function `read_and_store_data` returns the DataFrame.

    The DataFrame can be used for further analysis or machine learning tasks.
