    ### Response:
    The new feature you're adding is `new-feature.ipynb`. It seems to be a new Jupyter notebook file.

    Here's the content of `new-feature.ipynb`:

    ```python
    # This is a new feature
    print("This is a new feature.")
    ```

    This feature is added to the codebase.

    ### Response:
    The code in the cells you've provided is already well-organized and readable. However, there are a few improvements that could be made:

    1. Use of more descriptive variable names.
    2. Adding comments to explain complex parts of the code.
    3. Using meaningful function and class names.

    Here's an example of how you might refactor the code:

    ```python
    # Import necessary libraries
    from utils.plot_utils import plot_utils
    from utils.data_points import DataPoints
    from utils.training import Training

    # Load data
    data_points = DataPoints.load()
    training = Training.load()

    # Plot data
    plot
