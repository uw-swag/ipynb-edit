```go
    package main

    import (
        "fmt"
        "time"
    )

    func main() {
        fmt.Println("Hello, world!")

        messages := make(chan string)

        go func() {
            time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
            messages <- "ping"
        }()

        msg := <-messages
        fmt.Println(msg)
    }
    ```

    ### Installation
    You can install the Go programming language from the official website: https://golang.org/doc/install

    After installing Go, you can use the `go run` command to run your Go programs. For example, to run the above code, you would use the following command:

    ```
    go run main.go
    ```

    This will output:

    ```
    Hello, world!
    ping
    ```

    Please note that the `go run` command is used to run the Go program, not the Go language itself. The Go language is a statically typed, compiled language, and the `go run` command is used to compile and run the Go program.
