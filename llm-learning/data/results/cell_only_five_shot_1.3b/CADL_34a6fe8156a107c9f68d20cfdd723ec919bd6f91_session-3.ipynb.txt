    The code you provided is a TensorFlow 2.x code snippet for a simple autoencoder. The code initializes a TensorFlow session, trains an autoencoder on a dataset, and then reconstructs the input images.

    The code is using TensorFlow 2.x, which is a powerful deep learning framework. The code is also using a TensorFlow Dataset, which is a high-level interface for working with data in TensorFlow.

    The code is also using matplotlib to create a montage of the reconstruction. This is a common technique for visualizing the output of a deep learning model.

    The code is also using a preprocessing function, which is a function that takes a batch of data and returns a batch of preprocessed data. The preprocessing function is used to normalize the data and to reshape the data.

    The code is also using a deprocessing function, which is a function that takes a batch of preprocessed data and returns a batch of deprocessed data. The deprocessing function is used to denormalize the data and to reshape the data back to its original form.

    The code is also using a utils function, which is a function that takes a batch of deprocessed data and returns a batch of processed data. The utils function is used to create a montage of the reconstruction.

    The code is also using a cost function, which is a function that takes the output of the network and the target and returns the cost. The cost function is used to train the network.

    The code is also using an optimizer, which is a function that takes the gradients of the cost function and updates the weights of the network. The optimizer is used to train the network.

    The code is also using a function to ask for the output of the network, Y, and to give it our test examples. This is used to reconstruct the input.

    The code is also using a function to resize the 2d to the 4d representation. This is used to create a montage of the reconstruction.

    The code is also using a function to clip to avoid saturation. This is used to ensure that the images are not too bright.

    The code is also using a function to store for gif. This is used to create a gif of
