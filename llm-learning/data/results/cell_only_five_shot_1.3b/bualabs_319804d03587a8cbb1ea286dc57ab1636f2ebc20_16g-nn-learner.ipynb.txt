    This is a simple example of a 16GB neural network model. The model is a sequential model with three layers, each with 64 neurons. The last layer is a dense layer with 10 neurons and uses softmax activation. The model is compiled with Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function. The model is trained for 5 epochs and then evaluated on the test set. The model is saved to a file 'my_model.h5' and then loaded for prediction.
