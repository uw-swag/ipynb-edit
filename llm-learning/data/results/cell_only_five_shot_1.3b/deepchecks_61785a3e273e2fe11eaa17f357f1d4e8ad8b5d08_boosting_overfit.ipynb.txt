    The code you provided is already correct. It uses the mlchecks library to check for overfitting in an AdaBoost classifier. The function `boosting_overfit` is used to evaluate the model's performance on the training and validation datasets.

    If you want to modify the check without using a function, you can simply remove the function call from the code. Here's how you can do it:

    ```python
    from mlchecks import Dataset
    from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier

    train_ds = Dataset(train_df, label='target')
    validation_ds = Dataset(val_df, label='target')

    clf = AdaBoostClassifier(random_state=0)
    clf.fit(train_ds.features_columns(), train_ds.label_col())
    ```

    This will create a new AdaBoost classifier and fit it to the training data.

    Please note that the `boosting_overfit` function is not used in the provided code. If you want to modify the check without using a function, you can simply remove the function call from the code.
