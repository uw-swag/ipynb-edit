    ### 7.1 Introduction to Machine Learning

    #### 7.1.1 Definition of Machine Learning

    Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building intelligent machines that can learn from experience. It is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.

    #### 7.1.2 Importance of Machine Learning

    Machine Learning plays a crucial role in various fields such as healthcare, finance, marketing, and more. It helps businesses to automate decision-making, improve efficiency, and make data-driven decisions.

    #### 7.1.3 Types of Machine Learning

    There are several types of Machine Learning:

    - Supervised Learning: The model is trained on a labeled dataset. The goal is to learn a function that maps inputs to outputs.

    - Unsupervised Learning: The model is trained on an unlabeled dataset. The goal is to find patterns in the data.

    - Semi-supervised Learning: The model is trained on a mixture of labeled and unlabeled data.

    - Reinforcement Learning: The model learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment.

    #### 7.1.4 Challenges in Machine Learning

    While Machine Learning has many advantages, it also faces several challenges:

    - Overfitting: The model learns the training data too well, leading to poor generalization.

    - Underfitting: The model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data.

    - Interpretability: Machine Learning models often require human interpretation to understand their decision-making process.

    ## 7.2 Supervised Learning

    Supervised Learning is a type of Machine Learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset. The goal is to learn a function that maps inputs to outputs.

    ## 7.3 Unsupervised Learning

    Unsupervised Learning is a type of Machine Learning where the model is trained on an unlabeled dataset. The goal is to find patterns in the data.

    ## 7.4 Reinforcement Learning

    Reinforcement Learning is a type of Machine Learning where the model learns to make decisions by interacting with
