The code you provided is a live plotting of temperature data from an XADC (analog to digital converter) in Python using matplotlib. The data is appended to a pandas DataFrame and then plotted in real-time.

However, there are a few changes you can make to make this code more efficient and cleaner:

1. You can use a `for` loop to append the data to the DataFrame and then plot it. This will make your code more efficient and easier to read.

2. You can use the `time.time()` function to get the current time in seconds and then use this to update the plot.

Here's an example of how you could modify your code:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.dates as mdates
from matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation
import pandas as pd
import time

headers = ["Temperature (oC)","Time(Minutes)"]
df = pd.DataFrame() #Create an empty data frame to append to later

def animate(i):
    global df
    current_temp = !xadc_get_value_temp
    temp_value = float(current_temp[0][:5])
    clean_data_table = pd.DataFrame({'Temperature (oC)': [temp_value], 'Time(Minutes)': [i/60]})
    df = df.append(clean_data_table)
    
    x = df['Time(Minutes)']
    y1 = df['Temperature (oC)']
    plt.cla()
    plt.plot(x,y1)
    plt.gcf().autofmt_xdate()
    plt.xlabel('Time (Minutes)')
    plt.ylabel('Temprature (C)')
    plt.title("Temperature - Arcylic Case with Fan")

ani = FuncAnimation(plt.gcf(), animate,interval=1000)
plt.show()
```

In this version of the code, the data is appended to the DataFrame and then plotted in real-time. The `time.time()
