    The code you provided is a set of Python code that uses the DeepChecks library to compare the sizes of a training dataset and a test dataset. The DeepChecks library is a Python library for data quality checks, which is used to ensure the quality of the data used in machine learning models.

    The code first imports the necessary libraries and classes. It then defines a custom check `DatasetSizeComparison` that compares the sizes of the training and test datasets. The `run_logic` method of this class runs the check logic, which compares the sizes of the datasets and returns a `CheckResult` object.

    The `CheckResult` object contains the results of the check, which in this case is a dictionary with the sizes of the training and test datasets. The `display` attribute of the `CheckResult` object is a list of functions that will be called to display the results of the check.

    The code then creates a dummy dataset and runs the check. The results are then displayed using a matplotlib graph.

    Finally, the code ends with a comment that explains what the code does.

    The code is a good example of how to use the DeepChecks library to perform data quality checks.
