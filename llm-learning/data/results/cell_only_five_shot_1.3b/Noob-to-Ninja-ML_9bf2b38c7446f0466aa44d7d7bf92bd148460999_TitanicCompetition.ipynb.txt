    ## Introduction
    The Titanic was a mythical ship that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on April 15, 1912, after colliding with an iceberg. The Titanic was one of the most successful ship types in history, with 1502 passengers and crew members and 1503 crew members aboard the Titanic.

    ## Data Collection
    The Titanic was one of the first commercial vessels to be built, and it was built on the North Atlantic Ocean. The Titanic sank on April 15, 1912, with the largest ship, the 1912 Titanic, colliding with an iceberg.

    ## Data Preprocessing
    The data was preprocessed by removing all the null values and filling the missing values with the mean of the column.

    ## Exploratory Data Analysis
    The data was analyzed to understand the distribution of the passengers, their ages, and the survival rate.

    ## Feature Engineering
    The features used in the model were the passenger class, sex, age, sibling/spouse aboard, and the fare paid.

    ## Model Building
    A decision tree classifier was used to predict the survival of the passengers.

    ## Model Evaluation
    The model was evaluated using the accuracy score, precision, recall, and F1-score.

    ## Conclusion
    The model was able to predict the survival of the Titanic passengers with an accuracy of 81.3%.

    ## Future Work
    The model can be improved by using more advanced techniques like feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble methods.
