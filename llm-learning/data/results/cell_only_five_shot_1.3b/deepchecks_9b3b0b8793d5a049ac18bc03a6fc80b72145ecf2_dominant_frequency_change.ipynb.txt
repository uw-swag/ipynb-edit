    # The automatic commit feature is enabled by default.

    # Let's start with a simple example.
    # Suppose we have a dataframe df with some data.

    import pandas as pd

    # Create a dataframe
    df = pd.DataFrame({
        'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
        'B': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50],
        'C': ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
    })

    # Now, let's say we want to update the dataframe df.
    # We can do this by simply assigning a new value to a column.

    df['A'] = 10

    # Now, the automatic commit feature will automatically save the changes.
    # The commit message will be "[Automatic] Examples Update (#496)"

    # Let's print the dataframe to check the changes.
    print(df)
    ```
