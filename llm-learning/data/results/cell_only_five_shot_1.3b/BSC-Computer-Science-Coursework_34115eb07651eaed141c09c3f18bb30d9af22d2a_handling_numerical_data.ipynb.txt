    The code cells you provided are related to handling numerical data in a data science project. Here's a brief overview of the tasks:

    1. **Data Preprocessing**: This includes scaling numerical data to a range (0-1 or -1 to 1) and standardizing numerical data to have zero mean and unit variance.

    2. **Handling Missing Values**: This includes handling missing values in a dataset. The code cell for this task uses the `SimpleImputer` class from `sklearn.impute` to fill missing values with the mean of the respective column.

    3. **Handling Outliers**: This involves identifying and handling outliers in a dataset. The code cell for this task is not provided, but it's a good idea to use statistical methods to identify and handle outliers.

    4. **Feature Scaling**: This involves normalizing numerical features to have a common scale. The code cells for this task are provided, but it's important to note that scaling features to a common range can sometimes improve the performance of certain machine learning algorithms.

    5. **Handling Categorical Data**: This involves dealing with categorical data in a dataset. The code cells for this task are not provided, but it's a good idea to handle categorical data to make your machine learning models work better.

    6. **Handling Numerical Data**: This includes handling numerical data in a dataset. The code cells for this task are provided.

    7. **Clustering**: This involves grouping similar data points together. The code cell for this task is provided, but it's a good idea to use clustering to group similar data points.

    8. **Dimensionality Reduction**: This involves reducing the number of features in a dataset. The code cells for this task are not provided, but it's a good idea to use dimensionality reduction techniques to reduce the dimensionality of your data.

    9. **Handling Text Data**: This involves dealing with text data in a dataset. The code cells for this task are not provided, but it's a good idea to handle text data to make your machine learning models work better.

    10. **Handling Time Series Data**: This involves dealing with time series data in a dataset. The code cells for
