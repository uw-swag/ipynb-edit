```
    %maven ai.djl:basicdataset:0.20.0
    %maven ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-engine:0.20.0
    %maven org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:2.0.1
    ```
    The above cells are used to update the dependencies in your Maven project. The first two lines are for the `ai.djl` and `ai.djl.mxnet` libraries, while the last line is for the `org.slf4j` library.

    The version `0.20.0` is used in the above cells to represent the specific version of the libraries you are using. You should replace it with the latest version available.

    For example, if you want to update the `ai.djl` library to version `0.21.0`, you would replace the first two lines in the above cells with:

    ```
    %maven ai.djl:basicdataset:0.21.0
    %maven ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-engine:0.21.0
    ```

    Similarly, you can update the other dependencies as per your requirements.

    Please note that you should replace the version with the latest available version.
