    ### Response:
    The code you provided is already a complete data cleaning process. It reads a CSV file, drops any missing or duplicate rows, and saves the cleaned data to a new CSV file.

    If you want to add more cleaning steps, you can do so by modifying the code. For example, if you want to convert a column to a specific data type, you can do so like this:

    ```python
    # Convert 'column_name' to a specific data type
    df['column_name'] = df['column_name'].astype('new_data_type')
    ```

    If you want to perform more complex cleaning operations, you can use additional Python libraries like `pandas` and `numpy`.
