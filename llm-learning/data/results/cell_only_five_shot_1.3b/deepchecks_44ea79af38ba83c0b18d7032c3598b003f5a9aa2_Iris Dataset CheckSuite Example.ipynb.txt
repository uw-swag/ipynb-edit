```python
    # Importing necessary libraries
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
    from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

    # Loading the dataset
    data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

    # Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
    X = data.iloc[:, :-1].values
    y = data.iloc[:, -1].values
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 0)

    # Feature Scaling
    sc = StandardScaler()
    X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = sc.transform(X_test)

    # Training the Random Forest Classifier
    classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators = 10, criterion = 'entropy', random_state = 0)
    classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Predicting the Test set results
    y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)

    # Validating the model
    cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
    print(cm)
    print('Accuracy: ', accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
    ```
    This is a simple validation of the model using the confusion matrix and accuracy score. The model is trained on the training set and then the accuracy and confusion matrix are printed.
