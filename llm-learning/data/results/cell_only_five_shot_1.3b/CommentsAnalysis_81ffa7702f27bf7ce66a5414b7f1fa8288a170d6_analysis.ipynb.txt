    The code you've provided is a Jupyter notebook that includes several tasks, including data loading, data analysis, and data visualization. Here's a brief overview of what each section does:

    1. **Data Loading**: This section loads the `comments` and `users` data from the `.pkl` files. These data are then converted into a Pandas DataFrame.

    2. **Data Analysis**: This section filters the users based on their university and faculty, counts the number of users with each condition, and calculates the delta between the number of users with and without a university. It also drops users with no university and calculates the value counts of the 'is_gum' column.

    3. **Data Visualization**: This section creates a bar plot of the value counts of the 'is_gum' column, and a count plot of the 'hour' column. It also creates a factor plot of the 'likes' column and saves the resulting DataFrame to a CSV file.

    The final section of the notebook is a data cleaning process. It drops rows with empty 'text' values, calculates the 'hour' column from the 'date' column, and saves the resulting DataFrame to a CSV file.

    The notebook also includes a section that uses the 'sex' column to create a new column 'is_gum' and maps the values to boolean.

    The notebook also includes a section that uses the 'hour' column to create a new column 'is_gum' and maps the values to boolean.

    The notebook also includes a section that uses the 'likes' column to create a new column 'is_gum' and maps the values to boolean.

    The notebook also includes a section that uses the 'from_id' column to create a new column 'is_gum' and maps the values to boolean.

    The notebook also includes a section that uses the 'text' column to create a new column 'is_gum' and maps the values to boolean.

    The notebook also includes a section that uses the 'bdate' column to create a new column 'bmonth' and calculates the value counts of the 'bmonth' column.

    The notebook also includes a section that uses the '
