    The code you've provided is used to analyze the results of a machine learning experiment. The results are stored in a pandas DataFrame, which is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. The data is organized in a way that is easy to navigate and manipulate.

    The code is used to:

    1. Load the results from a directory of pickle files.
    2. Concatenate the results into a single DataFrame.
    3. Filter the results to only include the best performing models.
    4. Plot the training and test loss and accuracy for each model.

    The code is also used to:

    1. Identify the best pair of hyperparameters based on the difference in accuracy between the two most recent versions of the model.
    2. Plot the training and test loss and accuracy for the best pair of hyperparameters.

    The code is also used to:

    1. Sort the results by the final accuracy of the model.

    The final result is a DataFrame that contains the best pair of hyperparameters for each model, as well as the training and test loss and accuracy for each model.
