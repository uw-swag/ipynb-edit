    ## 1. Data Cleaning
    ## This step involves cleaning the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and outliers.

    ## 2. Feature Extraction
    ## This step involves extracting the features from the data. This could be done through various methods such as:
    ## - Handling categorical features: One-hot encoding, label encoding, etc.
    ## - Numeric features: Scaling, normalization, etc.
    ## - Time-series features: Windowing, differencing, etc.

    ## 3. Feature Transformation
    ## This step involves transforming the features to a form that is more suitable for machine learning algorithms. This could be done through various methods such as:
    ## - Polynomial features: Creating new features based on the existing ones.
    ## - Interaction features: Creating new features that combine the effects of two or more features.
    ## - Binary features: Creating new features that convert categorical features into binary.

    ## 4. Feature Selection
    ## This step involves selecting the most important features for the model. This could be done through various methods such as:
    ## - Filter methods: Selecting features based on their importance.
    ## - Wrapper methods: Selecting features based on their correlation with the target variable.
    ## - Embedded methods: Selecting features based on their relationship with other features.

    ## 5. Feature Combination
    ## This step involves combining the features to create new features that can improve the model's performance.

    ## 6. Feature Scaling
    ## This step involves scaling the features to a standard range. This is important for the performance of many machine learning algorithms.

    ## 7. Feature Encoding
    ## This step involves converting categorical features into numerical features. This is important for the performance of many machine learning algorithms.
