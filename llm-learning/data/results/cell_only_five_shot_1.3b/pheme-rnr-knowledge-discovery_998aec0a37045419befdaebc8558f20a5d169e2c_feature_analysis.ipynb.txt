The code you provided is used to present the correlation between different features and the rumor label. The features are the variables that we are interested in. The correlation coefficient is a statistical measure that describes the degree of association between two variables. A correlation of 1 means that for every positive increase in one variable, there is a positive increase of 1 in the other variable, and a correlation of -1 means that for every positive increase in one variable, there is a negative decrease in the other variable.

The code uses the seaborn library to create a bar plot, which is a type of chart that is used to present the relationship between two variables. The x-axis represents the features, and the y-axis represents the correlation coefficient.

The code also uses the matplotlib library to create the bar plot. The labels for the features are created using a list comprehension, which is a compact way of creating a list of values. The labels are then used to set the y-axis labels and the x-axis labels of the plot.

The code also uses the scipy.stats library to calculate the pearson correlation coefficient between the features and the rumor label. The result is then sorted and displayed on the plot.

The code also uses the pandas library to calculate the correlation coefficient and to create the bar plot. The result is then displayed in a matplotlib figure.
