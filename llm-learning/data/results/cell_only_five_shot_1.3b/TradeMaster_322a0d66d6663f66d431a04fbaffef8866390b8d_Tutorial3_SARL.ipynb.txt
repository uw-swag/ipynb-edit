    ## Tutorial 1: Introduction to NumPy

    NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

    ## Tutorial 2: Basic Operations in NumPy

    NumPy provides a large collection of mathematical functions to operate on arrays. Here are some of the most common operations:

    - Addition: `np.add(x, y)`
    - Subtraction: `np.subtract(x, y)`
    - Multiplication: `np.multiply(x, y)`
    - Division: `np.divide(x, y)`
    - Power: `np.power(x, y)`
    - Square root: `np.sqrt(x)`
    - Logarithm: `np.log(x)`
    - Trigonometric functions: `np.sin(x)`, `np.cos(x)`, `np.tan(x)`
    - Exponential and logarithmic functions: `np.exp(x)`, `np.log(x)`

    ## Tutorial 3: Broadcasting in NumPy

    Broadcasting is a feature in NumPy that allows you to perform arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes. It's particularly useful when working with multi-dimensional arrays.

    - Addition: `np.add(x, y)`
    - Subtraction: `np.subtract(x, y)`
    - Multiplication: `np.multiply(x, y)`
    - Division: `np.divide(x, y)`

    ## Tutorial 4: More Operations in NumPy

    NumPy also provides a large collection of mathematical functions to operate on arrays. Here are some more operations:

    - Dot product: `np.dot(x, y)`
    - Matrix multiplication: `np.matmul(x, y)`
    - Matrix inverse: `np.linalg.inv(x)`
    - Matrix determinant: `np.linalg.
