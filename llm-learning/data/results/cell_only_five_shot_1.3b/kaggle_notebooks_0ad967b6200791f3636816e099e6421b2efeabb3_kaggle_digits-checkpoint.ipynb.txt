    ### Kaggle Digits

    The Kaggle Digits dataset is a dataset of 8x8 images of digits. It contains 1797 8x8 images and 10 classes. The digits have been size normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.

    ## Digits Classification

    This notebook provides an example of how to use the Kaggle Digits dataset to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for digit classification. The CNN model is then used to classify the digits in the Kaggle Digits dataset.

    The notebook also includes an example of how to use a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model for digit classification. The MLP model is also used to classify the digits in the Kaggle Digits dataset.

    The notebook also includes an example of how to use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for digit classification. The RNN model is also used to classify the digits in the Kaggle Digits dataset.

    The notebook also includes an example of how to use a Multi-Class Classification model for digit classification. The Multi-Class Classification model is also used to classify the digits in the Kaggle Digits dataset.
