```python
    def callback(model, X, y, n_iter, n_epochs):
        # This function will be called after each epoch
        # model: the model being trained
        # X: the input data
        # y: the target values
        # n_iter: the number of iterations performed so far
        # n_epochs: the total number of epochs performed

        # You can add more information to the callback function
        print(f"Iteration: {n_iter}, Epochs: {n_epochs}")

        # You can also use the model to make predictions on the input data
        y_pred = model.predict(X)

        # You can calculate metrics such as the RMSE, MAE, etc.
        rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y, y_pred))
        print(f"RMSE: {rmse}")

        return
    ```
    This callback function will be called after each epoch, and you can add more information to the callback function. You can also use the model to make predictions on the input data and calculate metrics such as the RMSE.
