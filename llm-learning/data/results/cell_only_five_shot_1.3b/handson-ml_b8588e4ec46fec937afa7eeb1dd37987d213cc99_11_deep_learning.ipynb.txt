    ## Code Explanation

    The code snippet provided is a part of a larger process that includes hyperparameter tuning for a deep neural network model using the Scikit-Learn library. The hyperparameters are varied to find the best model. The hyperparameters include the number of neurons in the network, the batch size, the learning rate, and the activation function.

    The code also includes a new macro `NEXT_NOTEBOOK_URL` which is used to provide a link to a Kaggle notebook that can be used for further exploration.

    The code is divided into three main parts:

    1. The initial part of the code imports the necessary libraries and loads the data.

    2. The second part of the code defines the hyperparameter distribution for the model. This includes the number of neurons, batch size, learning rate, and activation function.

    3. The third part of the code uses a `RandomizedSearchCV` to tune the hyperparameters. This involves fitting the model to the training data and validating it on the validation data. The `RandomizedSearchCV` uses a randomized grid search to find the best hyperparameters.

    The code also includes a fourth part that adds a new hyperparameter, `dropout_rate`, to the model. This is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of the input units to 0 at each update during training time, which helps prevent overfitting.

    The final part of the code adds a new macro `NEXT_NOTEBOOK_URL` to the code. This macro is used to provide a link to a Kaggle notebook that can be used for further exploration.

    The final part of the code is a comment that provides a link to a Kaggle notebook that can be used for further exploration.

    The code is written in Python and uses the Scikit-Learn library for model tuning.
