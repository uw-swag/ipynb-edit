Here's how the code works:

1. The code imports necessary libraries and modules.
2. It fetches the California housing dataset and creates a dataframe.
3. It defines the target variable and the numerical and categorical features.
4. It creates a column mapping object to map the target and features.
5. It calculates the data drift dashboard for numerical and categorical features.
6. It calculates the data drift profile for numerical and categorical features.
7. It calculates the data and target drift dashboard for numerical and categorical features.
8. It calculates the data and target drift profile for numerical and categorical features.
9. It calculates the data and target drift dashboard and profile for numerical and categorical features.
10. It saves the dashboards to HTML files.

The code also includes a test generator usage example. The test generator is used to generate synthetic data for testing the model. The synthetic data is then used to calculate the model's performance metrics.

The updated README file includes:

1. Removed examples with dashboards and profiles from the sample_notebooks.
2. Added an example with test generators usage to how_to_questions.

The README file is updated to reflect these changes.
