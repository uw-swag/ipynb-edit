    The function `string_mismatch_comparison` is used to compare two dataframes. The function will return a list of rows where the strings in the 'col1' column of the two dataframes are not the same.

    The function is designed to handle strings that contain special characters, such as '$deeP$', which are not recognized by the function. The function will replace these special characters with their equivalent in the 'col1' column of the compared_data, and then compare the modified strings.

    The function will return a list of rows where the strings in the 'col1' column of the two dataframes are not the same.
