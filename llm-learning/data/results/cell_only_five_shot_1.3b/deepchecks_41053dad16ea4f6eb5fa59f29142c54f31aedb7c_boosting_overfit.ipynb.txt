```python
    from deepchecks import Dataset
    from deepchecks.checks.methodology.boosting_overfit import BoostingOverfit

    # Assuming train_df and val_df are your DataFrames
    train_ds = Dataset(train_df, label='target')
    validation_ds = Dataset(val_df, label='target')

    # Create a BoostingOverfit check
    bof_check = BoostingOverfit(train_ds)

    # Perform the check
    report = bof_check.run(validation_ds)

    # Print the report
    print(report)
    ```

    This code will perform the BoostingOverfit check on the training dataset and print the report. The report will provide information about the overfitting in the model.
