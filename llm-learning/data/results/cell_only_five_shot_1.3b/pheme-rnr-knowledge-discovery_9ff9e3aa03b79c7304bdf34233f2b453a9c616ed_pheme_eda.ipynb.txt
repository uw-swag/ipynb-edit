    The code you provided is already thread-level dataset. It fetches the event data as a Pandas DataFrame, and it also cleans the PHEME dataset by parsing the JSON data stored in directories of the PHEME dataset into a CSV file.

    The function `get_event_data` fetches the event data as a Pandas DataFrame. If the cleaned CSV file does not exist, it creates it by parsing the JSON data stored in directories of the PHEME dataset into a CSV file.

    The function `clean_pheme_by_event` parses json data stored in directories of the PHEME dataset into a CSV file.

    The function `tweet_to_df` converts tweet meta-data to DataFrame instance.

    The last two lines of the code are used to fetch the event data and display the first few rows of the DataFrame.

    The `refresh` parameter in the `get_event_data` function is used to refresh the data if it has not been refreshed before.

    The `refresh` parameter in the `tweet_to_df` function is used to convert the tweet meta-data to DataFrame instance.
