    The FocalLoss function is used in the code above. It is a loss function that is used in the Focal Loss for multi-class classification. The alpha parameter is the focusing parameter, and n_classes is the number of classes.

    The FocalLoss function is a modification of the standard cross-entropy loss function, but it is designed to give more weight to the wrong predictions, which can be useful in cases where the classes are imbalanced.

    The CutMix is a data augmentation technique that is used to increase the diversity of the training set. It works by randomly selecting a small part of a sample and mixing it with a larger part of the sample.

    The code above changes the loss function to FocalLoss and the data augmentation technique to CutMix.
