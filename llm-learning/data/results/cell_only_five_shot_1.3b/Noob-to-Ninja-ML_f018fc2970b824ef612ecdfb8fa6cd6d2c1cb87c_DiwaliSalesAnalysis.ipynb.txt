    # You can add files via upload by using the `upload` function provided by the `ipywidgets` library. Here's an example:

    ```python
    from IPython.display import FileUpload
    from IPython.display import display

    upload = FileUpload()
    display(upload)
    ```

    After running this code, you'll be able to select the files you want to upload. Once you've selected the files, you can then use the `files` property of the `FileUpload` object to access the uploaded files.

    Here's an example of how you might use the `files` property:

    ```python
    if 'file' in upload.files:
        uploaded_file = upload.files['file']
        # You can now use the uploaded_file object to perform any operations on the file
    ```

    Please note that the `upload` function will only work in a Jupyter notebook environment. If you're running this code in a different environment, you'll need to replace the `FileUpload` and `display` functions with the appropriate functions for your environment.
