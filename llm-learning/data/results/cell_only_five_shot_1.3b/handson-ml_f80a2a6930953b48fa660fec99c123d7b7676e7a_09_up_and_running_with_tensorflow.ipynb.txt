    The code you provided is a mix of Python and TensorFlow code. It's not clear what you're asking for, but here's a brief explanation of what the code is doing:

    1. It's defining a TensorFlow graph with a variable `x` and a variable `y`.
    2. It's defining a function `f` that computes the value of `x` squared times `y` plus `y` plus 2.
    3. It's computing the gradients of `f` with respect to `x` and `y`.
    4. It's initializing the variables `x` and `y`, running the graph, and printing the result.

    If you have a specific question or need help with a different part of this code, please provide more details.
