    This function will crop the image to the square shape if the image is not a square shape. If the image is a square shape, it will return the original image.
    The function is designed to handle images of any size, not just square images.
    The function uses integer division to determine the number of pixels to crop from each side. If the number of pixels to crop is an even number, it will crop from the center. If it's an odd number, it will crop from the center and one pixel to the side.
    The function uses the numpy library to perform the cropping.
    The function is named `imcrop_tosquare` to make it clear that it's a function to crop images to square shapes.
    The function takes an image as input and returns the cropped image.
    The function is documented with a docstring to provide a description of what the function does and what its parameters and return values are.
    The function is tested with a variety of images to ensure it works as expected.
    The function is also tested with a large number of images to ensure it handles large images
