The code you provided is a part of a larger process that includes training a model for image classification, and it also includes the calculation of the area under the curve (AUC) for sensitivity-specificity plots.

The training process is done using a pretrained VGG16 model from torchvision. The model is then modified to have a single output neuron for binary classification, and the weights of the pretrained model are loaded into the model.

The code then plots sensitivity-specificity curves for both all data and filtered data. The AUC is also calculated for each of the three types of filtered data.

The code is not complete and does not include the evaluation of the model on the validation set, which is necessary for the AUC calculation.

The code also does not include the calculation of the AUC for each of the three types of filtered data, which is also necessary for the sensitivity-specificity plots.

Here is a complete version of the code:
