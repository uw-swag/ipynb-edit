Here's a new example and new install docs:

**Example:**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
	"time"

	"github.com/goml/gobrain"
)

func main() {
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())

	patterns := [][]float64{
		{0, 0}, {0},
		{0, 1}, {1},
		{1, 0}, {1},
		{1, 1}, {0},
	}

	ff := &gobrain.FeedForward{}
	ff.Init(2, 2, 1)
	ff.Train(patterns, 1000, 0.6, 0.4, true)
	ff.Test(patterns)
	ff.SetContexts(1, nil)
}
```

**Installation:**

You can install the `goml/gobrain` package using the following command:

```bash
go get github.com/goml/gobrain
```

This will download and install the package to your local Go workspace.

Please note that the `goml/gobrain` package is a simple implementation of a feedforward neural network, and it's not suitable for complex tasks. For more complex tasks, you might want to consider using a more advanced library or package.
