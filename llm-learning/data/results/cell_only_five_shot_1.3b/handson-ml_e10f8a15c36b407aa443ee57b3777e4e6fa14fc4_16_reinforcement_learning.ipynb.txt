    The code you provided is a part of a larger codebase, and it seems to be related to the rendering of an environment in a reinforcement learning task, such as CartPole or MsPacman.

    The code is trying to render the environment, and then perform an action in the environment. The action is hard-coded, and the environment is reset and rendered again after each action.

    The issue you're facing is likely due to the way the environment is being rendered. The current rendering method is using the `render` method of the environment, which returns a numpy array of RGB values. However, the `render` method of the environment is not designed to be used in a Jupyter notebook, as it does not display the rendered image in a notebook.

    To fix the issue, you can use a matplotlib figure to display the rendered image. Here's how you can modify your code:

    ```python
    def plot_environment(env, figsize=(5,4)):
        plt.figure(figsize=figsize)
        img = env.render(mode="rgb_array")
        plt.imshow(img)
        plt.axis("off")
        plt.show()
    ```

    This code will display the rendered image in a Jupyter notebook.

    However, please note that the `render` method of the environment is not designed to be used in a Jupyter notebook, as it does not display the rendered image in a notebook.
