```python
    # Clear output and minor fix on notebooks (#121)
    from IPython.display import clear_output

    # Clear the output
    clear_output()

    # Minor fix on notebooks (#121)
    # Fixes the issue where the notebook was not running as expected
    # The issue was due to the fact that the notebook was not properly closed after running the code
    # This was fixed by adding a line to close the notebook after running the code
    import IPython
    IPython.display.close_notebook()
    ```
