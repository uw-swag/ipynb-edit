```python
    # Improve model performance by tuning hyperparameters

                              wordEmb_file=wordEmb_file,
                              entityEmb_file=entityEmb_file,
                              epochs=epoch,
                              lr=0.01,
                              batch_size=32,
                              hidden_dim=100,
                              dropout=0.5,
                              early_stopping_patience=5)

    # Re-run the model with the new hyperparameters
    if run_MIND_small:
        input_creator = DKNTextIterator
        model = DKN(hparams, input_creator)
        model.fit(train_file, valid_file)

    # Save the model for future use
    model.save('dkn_model.pkl')
    ```
    This code changes the hyperparameters of the model to improve its performance. The new hyperparameters include learning rate (lr), batch size (batch_size), hidden dimension (hidden_dim), dropout rate (dropout), and early stopping patience (early_stopping_patience). The model is then re-run with these new hyperparameters and the model is saved for future use.
