    ## Example 1: Customising the model for a specific task
    ## Here, we customize the model for a specific task, such as image inpainting.
    ## We use the CLIPSeg model for image inpainting, and we customize the pipeline
    ## to use the model and the processor.

    ## Example 2: Customising the input and output
    ## Here, we customize the input and output of the model.
    ## We use a custom input function that decodes a base64 encoded image,
    ## and a custom output function that encodes the generated image as a base64 string.

    ## Example 3: Customising the prediction endpoint
    ## Here, we customize the prediction endpoint.
    ## We use a custom predictor that uses a different instance type,
    ## and a custom serializer and deserializer.

    ## Example 4: Customising the model deployment
    ## Here, we customize the model deployment.
    ## We use a custom endpoint name, and we customize the model to use a different framework version.

    ## Example 5: Customising the model deployment
    ## Here, we customize the model deployment.
    ## We use a custom endpoint name, and we customize the model to use a different py_version.

    ## Example 6: Customising the model deployment
    ## Here, we customize the model deployment.
    ## We use a custom endpoint name, and we customize the model to use a different role.

    ## Example 7: Customising the model deployment
    ## Here, we customize the model deployment.
    ## We use a custom endpoint name, and we customize the model to use a different region.

    ## Example 8: Customising the model deployment
    ## Here, we customize the model deployment.
    ## We use a custom endpoint name, and we customize the model to use a different bucket.

    ## Example 9: Customising the model deployment
    ## Here, we customize the model deployment.
    ## We use a
