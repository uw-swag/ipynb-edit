    ]

    ### Response:
    Your web application is now structured with a Flask application. The home page is served by the `home` route, and the prediction page is served by the `predict` route.

    The `home` route renders the 'home.html' template, which is a simple HTML page that contains a form for user input. The `predict` route handles the POST request made when the form is submitted, and it's where you would add your prediction code.

    The `if __name__ == '__main__':` line ensures that the code is only run when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module.

    Please note that you need to create a 'home.html' template in a templates directory in the same directory as your Python script. This template should contain a form for user input and a place to display the prediction result.

    Also, you need to handle the form submission in the 'predict' route, and you can use the `request` object to access the form data.

    Remember to replace the placeholder code in the `predict` route with your actual prediction code.
