```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np

    # Load the data
    df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

    # Preprocess the data
    # This is a simple example, you may need to adjust it based on your specific dataset
    df['column_to_normalize'] = (df['column_to_normalize'] - df['column_to_normalize'].mean()) / df['column_to_normalize'].std()

    # Split the data into features and target
    X = df.drop('target_column', axis=1)
    y = df['target_column']

    # Normalize the features
    X = (X - X.mean()) / X.std()

    return X, y
    ```
    This code will preprocess the data by normalizing a specific column and splitting the data into features and target. The preprocessing step is a simple example and may need to be adjusted based on the specifics of your dataset.
