    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the evidently library to analyze the data drift in the California housing dataset. The notebook first imports the necessary libraries and loads the dataset. It then calculates a Data Drift Dashboard, which shows the statistical properties of the numerical features in the dataset.

    The notebook then uses the Anderson's test to compare the statistical properties of the numerical features in the reference and production data. The Anderson's test is a non-parametric test that is used to compare the distribution of a sample to a reference distribution. The test returns a p-value, which is used to determine if the sample is significantly different from the reference distribution.

    The notebook then uses the Data Drift Profile to analyze the numerical features in the dataset. The Data Drift Profile shows the statistical properties of the numerical features in the dataset, such as the mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis.

    The notebook then uses the Data Drift Options to customize the statistical tests and the number of bins for the numerical features. The Data Drift Options allow you to specify the confidence level and the number of bins for the numerical features.

    The notebook finally shows the Data Drift Dashboard and the Data Drift Profile. The Data Drift Dashboard shows the statistical properties of the numerical features in the dataset, while the Data Drift Profile shows the statistical properties of the numerical features in the dataset.

    The notebook ends with the JSON representation of the Data Drift Profile.

    Please note that the code you provided is a part of a larger codebase and it's not clear what the purpose of the code is. The code is used to analyze the data drift in the California housing dataset and it's not clear what the purpose of the code is.
