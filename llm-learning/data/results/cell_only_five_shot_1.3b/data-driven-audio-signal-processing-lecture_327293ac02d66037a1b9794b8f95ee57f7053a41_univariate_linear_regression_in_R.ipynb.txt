```R

    # This will be the notebook for univariate linear regression

    # Load necessary libraries

    # Load the dataset
    data <- read.csv("data.csv")

    # Perform linear regression
    model <- lm(formula = y ~ x, data = data)

    # Print the summary of the model
    summary(model)

    ggplot() +

    This R code performs a simple univariate linear regression on the data in the "data.csv" file. The `lm()` function is used to fit a linear model, and the `summary()` function is used to print the model summary. The `ggplot()` function is used to create a plot of the data and the fitted line.
