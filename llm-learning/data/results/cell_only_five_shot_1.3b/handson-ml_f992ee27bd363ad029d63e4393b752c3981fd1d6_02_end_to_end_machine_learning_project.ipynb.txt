```python
    # Exercise 1
    # Write a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list that contains only the even numbers from the input list.

    def get_even_numbers(numbers):
        return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]

    # Exercise 2
    # Write a Python function that takes a string as input and returns a new string that contains the same characters in reverse order.

        return s[::-1]

    # Exercise 3
    # Write a Python function that takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list that contains only the strings that are palindromes.

    # Exercise 4
