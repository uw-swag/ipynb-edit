The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the Deepchecks library to analyze the performance of a model on the MNIST dataset. The notebook first loads the dataset and the model, then it runs a robustness report on the dataset. The robustness report is a check that measures the robustness of a model by comparing the model's predictions to the true values. The check is then used to filter out any predictions that are not greater than 0.05.

The code is written in Python and uses the Deepchecks library, which is a Python library for data quality checks. The Deepchecks library provides a wide range of checks for data quality and performance, including robustness checks.

The notebook ends with the result of the robustness report, which includes the value of the check and the visualization of the results.

The code can be deleted as it is not necessary for the task at hand.
