    The code you provided is already in the correct format. It's a Python code snippet that uses the DeepChecks library to perform performance checks on a model trained on the COCO dataset. The `VisionData` class is used to load the dataset, and the `ImageSegmentPerformance` class is used to evaluate the model's performance. The `DetectionPredictionFormatter` class is used to format the predictions from the model, and the `add_condition_score_from_mean_ratio_not_less_than` method is used to add a condition to the performance check.

    The code is well-structured and follows the Pythonic practices. However, it seems like you're using the `VisionData` class, which is deprecated and replaced by the `VisionDataset` class in the DeepChecks library. You might want to replace `VisionData` with `VisionDataset` to ensure the code works as expected.

    Here's the updated code:

    ```python
    from deepchecks.vision.datasets.detection import coco
    from deepchecks.vision.utils.detection_formatters import DetectionPredictionFormatter
    from deepchecks.vision.checks.performance import ImageSegmentPerformance
