    The code you provided is a part of a machine learning project. It's used to load and preprocess data, then train a model on the data. The model is a simple logistic regression model.

    Here's a comparison of the model's performance on the training and test sets:

    ```python
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

    # Train the model
    model = LogisticRegression()
    model.fit(train_df.drop(label_name, axis=1), train_df[label_name])

    # Make predictions
    train_predictions = model.predict(train_df.drop(label_name, axis=1))
    test_predictions = model.predict(test_df.drop(label_name, axis=1))

    # Calculate metrics
    train_accuracy = accuracy_score(train_df[label_name], train_predictions)
    test_accuracy = accuracy_score(test_df[label_name], test_predictions)

    train_precision = precision_score(train_df[label_name], train_predictions)
    test_precision = precision_score(test_df[label_name], test_predictions)

    train_recall = recall_score(train_df[label_name], train_predictions)
    test_recall = recall_score(test_df[label_name], test_predictions)

    train_f1 = f1_score(train_df[label_name], train_predictions)
    test_f1 = f1_score(test_df[label_name], test_predictions)

    print(f"Train Accuracy: {train_accuracy}")
    print(f"Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy}")
    print(f"Train Precision: {train_precision}")
    print(f"Test Precision: {test_precision}")
    print(f"Train Recall: {train_recall}")
    print(f"Test Rec
