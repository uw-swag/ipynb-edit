    # Example 1:
    # Let's say we have a dataset with two features, 'x' and 'y', and we want to use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data.

    from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

    # Assume we have the following data
    X = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8], [9, 10]]

    # Standardize the features
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

    # Create a PCA object
    pca = PCA(n_components=2)

    # Fit and transform the data
    X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_scaled)

    print(X_pca)

    # Example 2:
    # Let's say we have a dataset with two features, 'x' and 'y', and we want to use a logistic regression model to predict the class of a data point.

    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

    # Assume we have the following data
    X = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8], [9, 10]]
    y = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

    # Create a logistic regression object
    logistic_regression = LogisticRegression()

    # Fit the model
    logistic_regression.fit(X, y)

    # Predict the class of a new data point
    new_data = [[6, 7]]
    new_data_scaled = scaler.transform(new_data)
    new_data_pca = pca.transform(new_data_scaled)
    prediction = logistic_regression.predict(new_data_pca)
