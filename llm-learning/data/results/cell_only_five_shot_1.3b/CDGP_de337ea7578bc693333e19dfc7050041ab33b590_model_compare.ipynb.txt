    The code you provided is a comparison of two models for a task of masked language modeling. The first model is a BERT model, and the second model is a CLOTH&GDen model. The CLOTH&GDen model is a language model that is trained to predict the next word in a sentence given the previous words.

    The code is divided into several sections:

    1. The code imports necessary libraries and models.
    2. The code defines the questions and their answers and distractors.
    3. The code initializes the BERT model and the CLOTH&GDen model.
    4. The code tokenizes the questions and distractors, and then uses the BERT model to predict the next word for each question.
    5. The code counts the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each model.

    The code is not complete and does not run. It is a part of a larger code that is not provided here.

    Please note that the CLOTH&GDen model is not provided in the code you provided. You need to train a CLOTH&GDen model on your data or use a pre-trained model.
