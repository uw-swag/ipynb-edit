    The code you provided seems to be a part of a machine learning model training process. The error in the code is likely due to a missing import for the `autogen` package.

    The `autogen` package is not a standard package in the DJL library, so it's not included in the code you provided. 

    You need to add the following import to your code:

    ```java
    import ai.djl.autogen;
    ```

    This import statement is missing in your code. 

    After adding this import, your code should compile and run without any errors.
