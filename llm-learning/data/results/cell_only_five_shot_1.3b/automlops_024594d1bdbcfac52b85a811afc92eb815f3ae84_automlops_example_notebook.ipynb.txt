    The code you've provided is a part of a function call in Python, which is used to install a package using pip. The package name is 'AutoMLOps', and the version number is '1.0.2'. The `--user` flag is used to install the package for the current user.

    However, the code you've provided is not a complete Python script. It's a part of a Jupyter notebook, and it's not clear what the purpose of this code is. 

    If you're looking to create a Python package and distribute it to PyPI, you would need to create a setup.py file in your project directory, and then use the `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel` command to create a source distribution and a wheel distribution. After that, you can use the `twine upload dist/*` command to upload your package to PyPI.

    If you're looking to use this code in a different context, please provide more details so I can give a more accurate answer.
