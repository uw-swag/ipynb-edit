```python
    # Import necessary libraries
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

    # Load the dataset
    df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

    # Data preprocessing
    # This step depends on the specific dataset. You may need to handle missing values, outliers, etc.

    # Split the dataset into features and target variable
    X = df.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
    y = df['target_variable']

    # Split the dataset into training set and test set
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Feature scaling
    sc = StandardScaler()
    X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = sc.transform(X_test)

    # Model training
    classifier = LogisticRegression(random_state=42)
    classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Model prediction
    y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)

    # Model evaluation
    print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
    print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

    # Visualization
    # You can use seaborn or matplotlib to visualize the performance of your model.
    # For example, you can plot a confusion matrix or a ROC curve.

    # Note: This is a basic example. Depending on the specific dataset and problem, you may need to perform more advanced preprocessing, model tuning, and visualization.
