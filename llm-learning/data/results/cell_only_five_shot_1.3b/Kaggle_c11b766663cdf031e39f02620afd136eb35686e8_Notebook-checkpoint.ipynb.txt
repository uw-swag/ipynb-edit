The code you provided is a good start for a logistic regression model. However, it's not optimal for this task. The accuracy of the model is not very high. 

Here are a few things you could do to improve the accuracy:

1. **Feature Engineering**: You've created new features that might be useful for the model. However, you need to ensure that these new features are relevant to the problem at hand.

2. **Model Tuning**: You're using a grid search to find the best parameters for the logistic regression model. You could use a more efficient method, like RandomizedSearchCV, to find the best parameters.

3. **Model Selection**: You're using a neural network model. While it's a good start, you might want to try other models like decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting machines.

4. **Data Preprocessing**: You're dealing with categorical features. You might want to use one-hot encoding or label encoding for these features.

5. **Early Stopping**: In the XGBoost model, you're using early stopping. This can help to prevent overfitting.

6. **Ensemble Methods**: You can also try ensemble methods like bagging or boosting to improve the accuracy.

Here's how you could implement these improvements:

```python
# Tune hyperparameters
param_test = {'max_depth':range(3,10), 'eta':np.logspace(-4,-0.5,50), 'min_child_weight':range(1,6)}
gsearch = GridSearchCV(estimator = xgb.XGBClassifier(use_label_encoder=False,eval_metric='logloss'), 
param_grid = param_test, scoring='accuracy',n_jobs=4,iid=False, cv=5)
gsearch.fit(X,Y)

# Use the best parameters
best_model = gsearch.best_estimator_
best_model.fit(X,Y)

# Predict
Y_pred = best_model.predict(X_test)

# Check accuracy
accuracy_score(Y, Y_pred)
```

Remember, the best way
