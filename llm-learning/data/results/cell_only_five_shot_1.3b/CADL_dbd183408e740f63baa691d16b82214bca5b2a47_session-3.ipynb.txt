The error you're encountering is because the `std()` function in Pandas DataFrame returns a Series, not a single number. To get a single number, you need to use the `values` attribute of the DataFrame. Here's how you can do it:

```python
std_img = ds.std().values[0]
plt.imshow(std_img)
print(std_img.shape)
```

This will convert the Series returned by `std()` into a single number, which you can then use for your image display.
