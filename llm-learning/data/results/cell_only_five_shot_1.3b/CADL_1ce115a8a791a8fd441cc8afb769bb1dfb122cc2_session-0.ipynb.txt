```python
    # Load the os library
    import os

    # Load the request module
    import urllib.request

    # Create a directory
    os.mkdir('img_align_celeba')

    # Now perform the following 10 times:
    for img_i in range(1, 11):

        # create a string using the current loop counter
        f = '000%03d.jpg' % img_i

        # and get the url with that string appended the end
        url = 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/cadl/celeb-align/' + f

        # We'll print this out to the console so we can see how far we've gone
        print(url, end='\r')

        # And now download the url to a location inside our new directory
        urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, os.path.join('img_align_celeba', f))

    ```

    ### Explanation:
    This script downloads images from a URL to a directory. The URLs are created by appending a string to a base URL, and the images are downloaded to the directory. The script uses the `urllib.request.urlretrieve` function to download the images. The `os.path.join` function is used to create the full path to the image file. The `print` function is used to print the progress of the download, and the `end='\r'` argument is used to move the cursor to the start of the line.
