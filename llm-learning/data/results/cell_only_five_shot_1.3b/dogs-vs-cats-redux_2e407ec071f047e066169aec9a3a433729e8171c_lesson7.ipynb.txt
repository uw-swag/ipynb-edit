    # This is a code for a deep learning model to classify images.
    # The model is a VGG16-based model with some modifications.
    # The model is trained on the Fish dataset.
    # The model is evaluated on the Fish dataset.
    # The model is saved and loaded for later use.
    # The model is used to predict bounding boxes for images.
    # The model is used to predict classes for images.
    # The model is used to predict probabilities for images.
    # The model is used to predict classes and probabilities for images.
