```python
    # Import necessary libraries
    import geopandas as gpd
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Load the geospatial data
    df = gpd.read_file(r'path_to_your_file.shp')

    # Display the data
    print(df.head())

    # Plot the data
    df.plot()
    plt.show()
    ```

    This notebook introduces the concept of geospatial data analysis using Python and the popular geospatial data analysis library, GeoPandas. The notebook loads a shapefile (a type of geospatial data file) and displays its contents, then plots the data.

    Please replace `'path_to_your_file.shp'` with the actual path to your shapefile.

    This is a basic introduction to geospatial data analysis. Depending on your specific needs, you may need to perform more complex analysis, such as spatial join operations, spatial aggregation, or spatial statistics.

    Note: This notebook assumes that you have the GeoPandas library installed. If you don't, you can install it using pip:

    ```python
    pip install geopandas
    ```

    Also, this notebook does not include any code for data cleaning or preprocessing. You may need to add that code based on your specific needs.
