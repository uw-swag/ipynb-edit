The code is a simple implementation of a neural network with ReLU activation function. The network has two hidden layers, each with a different number of neurons (nh1 and nh2). The weights and biases for each layer are initialized randomly.

The code starts by importing necessary libraries and defining a function to test if a number is close to zero. This function is used to check if the weights and biases are near zero.

The code then defines the number of neurons in the hidden layers (nh1 and nh2) and initializes the weights and biases for each layer.

The code then defines a function to calculate the linear transformation of the input data with the weights and biases. This function is used to calculate the output of the network.

The code then defines a function to calculate the ReLU activation function. This function is used to apply the ReLU activation function to the output of the network.

The code then calculates the mean and standard deviation of the output of the network.

The code ends with a comment that describes the purpose of the code.
