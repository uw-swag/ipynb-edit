    The code you provided is a TensorFlow 2.x code snippet for a simple image classification model. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    1. It imports necessary libraries and modules.
    2. It sets up the TensorFlow session and checks for GPU availability.
    3. It loads the TensorFlow Datasets module and disables the progress bar.
    4. It defines the model architecture and compiles it.
    5. It prints the model summary.
    6. It defines utility functions for plotting.
    7. It downloads and saves test images.
    8. It zips the test images and downloads the zip file.

    The code also includes a section for downloading the zip file. If the download fails, it simply passes, which is a common practice in machine learning projects.

    The code ends with a call to `try-except` to download the zip file. If the download fails, it simply passes, which is a common practice in machine learning projects.

    Please note that the code snippet you provided is incomplete and does not include the part where the model is trained and the predictions are made.
