    ## Label Drift
    ## Explanation:
    ## Label Drift is a concept in machine learning that refers to the phenomenon where the labels of a dataset change over time. This can be due to various reasons such as new data being introduced, the data being collected from a different source, or the data being collected in a different way.
    ## In the context of machine learning, label drift can be a problem as it can lead to inaccurate predictions.
    ##
    ## This notebook will cover the following steps:
    ## 1. Understanding Label Drift
    ## 2. Detecting Label Drift
    ## 3. Preventing Label Drift
    ## 4. Evaluating Label Drift
    ##
    ## This notebook will also include an example of how to detect label drift in a dataset using the Python library `label_drift`.

    ## 1. Understanding Label Drift
    ## Label drift is a concept in machine learning that refers to the phenomenon where the labels of a dataset change over time. This can be due to various reasons such as new data being introduced, the data being collected from a different source, or the data being collected in a different way.
    ## In the context of machine learning, label drift can be a problem as it can lead to inaccurate predictions.

    ## 2. Detecting Label Drift
    ## Detecting label drift is a critical step in any machine learning project. There are several ways to detect label drift, such as using statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and domain knowledge.
    ## Here, we will use the `label_drift` library to detect label drift in a dataset.

    ## 3. Preventing Label Drift
    ## Preventing label drift is a more advanced step. It involves strategies to ensure that the model is not being overly relied on for its predictions.
    ## This could involve using more accurate models, or using techniques like regularization, or using more data.

    ## 4. Evaluating Label Drift
    ## Evaluating label drift is a crucial step in the machine learning lifecycle. It involves measuring how well the model is performing and how it is handling
