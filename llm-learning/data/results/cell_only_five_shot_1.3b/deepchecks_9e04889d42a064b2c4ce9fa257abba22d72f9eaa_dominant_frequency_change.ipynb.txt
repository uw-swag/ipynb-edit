    Original Code Cells:
    '''
    # Checking for dominant frequency change
    dominant_freq_change = df_spread[df_spread['PercentBet_ML'] != df_spread['PercentBet_Spread']]
    dominant_freq_change
    '''
    ]

    ### Response:
    The code you provided is a check for dominant frequency change in the 'PercentBet_ML' and 'PercentBet_Spread' columns of the dataframe 'df_spread'. It checks for any rows where the 'PercentBet_ML' is not equal to the 'PercentBet_Spread'. If such a row exists, it is added to the 'dominant_freq_change' dataframe.

    However, the code you provided is incomplete. It seems like you want to check for dominant frequency change in the 'PercentBet_ML' and 'PercentBet_Spread' columns of the dataframe 'df_spread'. If such a row exists, it is added to the 'dominant_freq_change' dataframe.

    Here is the complete code:

    ```python
    # Checking for dominant frequency change
    dominant_freq_change = df_spread[df_spread['PercentBet_ML'] != df_spread['PercentBet_Spread']]
    dominant_freq_change
    ```

    This code will return a dataframe 'dominant_freq_change' that contains all the rows in 'df_spread' where the 'PercentBet_ML' is not equal to the 'PercentBet_Spread'.
