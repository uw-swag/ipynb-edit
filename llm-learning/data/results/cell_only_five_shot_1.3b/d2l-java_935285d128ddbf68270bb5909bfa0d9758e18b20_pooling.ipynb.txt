    The Maven repository you've provided is for Maven snapshots. Maven snapshots are the versions that are not released yet.

    The `ai.djl:api:0.7.0-SNAPSHOT`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.26`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:1.7.26`, and `net.java.dev.jna:jna:5.3.0` are dependencies that you're using.

    The `ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-engine:0.7.0-SNAPSHOT` and `ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-native-auto:1.7.0-a` are dependencies that you're using for the MxNet library.

    To update the MxNet-native version, you can use the following commands:

    ```
    %maven ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-engine:0.7.0-SNAPSHOT
    %maven ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-native-auto:1.7.0-a
    ```

    Please replace `0.7.0-SNAPSHOT` with the latest version of the MxNet-native library you want to use.

    After running these commands, Maven will download and install the latest version of the MxNet-native library.

    Please note that the MxNet-native version you're using might not be compatible with the MxNet version you're using. Make sure to check the compatibility before updating.
