The code you provided is a Python script that reads data from a serial port, cleans the data, and then saves it to a CSV file. It also includes a simple plot of the data.

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. The script first imports the necessary modules.
2. It then defines the port path, baud rate, timeout, filename, and maximum number of readings.
3. The `create_serial_obj` function creates a pyserial object with the given parameters.
4. The `is_number` function checks if a string is a number.
5. The `clean_serial_data` function cleans the serial data by removing all characters and converting the string to a float.
6. The `save_to_csv` function saves the cleaned data to a CSV file.
7. The `gen_col_list` function generates a list of column names for the data.
8. The `map_value` function maps the voltage values from 0-1023 to 0-5.
9. The `simple_plot` function generates a simple plot of the data.
10. The `plot_csv` function generates a plot of the data.
11. The script then creates a serial object, reads the serial data, cleans the data, saves it to a CSV file, and plots the data.

Please note that the `plot_csv` function is commented out because it's not working as expected. The commented out code is for a different purpose and it's not clear what it does.
