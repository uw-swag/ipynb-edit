```python
    # Write a function to preprocess/normalize an image, given its dataset object
    # (which stores the mean and standard deviation!)
    def preprocess(img, ds):
        norm_img = (img - ds.mean) / ds.stddev
        return norm_img

    # Write a function to undo the normalization of an image, given its dataset object
    # (which stores the mean and standard deviation!)
    def deprocess(norm_img, ds):
        img = norm_img * ds.stddev + ds.mean
        return img

    # Just to make sure that you've coded the previous two functions correctly:
    assert(np.allclose(deprocess(preprocess(ds.X[0], ds), ds), ds.X[0]))
    ```
