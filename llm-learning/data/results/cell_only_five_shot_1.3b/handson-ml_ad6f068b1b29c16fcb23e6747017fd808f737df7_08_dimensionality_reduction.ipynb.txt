    ### Exercise 2
    # Write a Python function that takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list that contains only the strings that are longer than 5 characters.

        return [string for string in strings if len(string) > 5]

    ### Exercise 3
    # Write a Python function that takes a list of tuples as input and returns a new list that contains only the second element of each tuple.
