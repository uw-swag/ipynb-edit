```python
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

    # Load the dataset
    df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

    # Text preprocessing
    vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
    X = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['text'])

    # Convert the sparse matrix to a DataFrame
    X_df = pd.DataFrame(X.toarray(), columns=vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())

    # Print the DataFrame
    print(X_df)
    ```
    This code will preprocess the text data in the 'text' column of the DataFrame. The CountVectorizer class from the sklearn.feature_extraction.text module is used to convert the text data into a matrix of token counts. The resulting matrix is then converted to a DataFrame for easier manipulation.

    Please replace 'data.csv' with your actual data file path.

    Also, please note that this is a basic example. Depending on your specific needs, you may need to perform additional preprocessing steps such as removing stop words, stemming, lemmatization, etc.

    The preprocessed DataFrame can then be used for further analysis or modeling.
