```
    from evidently.metric_preset import DataDriftPreset
    from evidently.report import Report

    # Define the metrics and color options
    metrics = [DataDriftPreset()]
    color_options = color_scheme

    # Create a Report object
    report = Report(metrics=metrics, color_options=color_options)

    # Run the report
    report.run(current_data=current_data, reference_data=reference_data)

    # Define the tests and color options
    test_preset = DataDriftTestPreset()
    color_options = color_scheme

    # Create a TestSuite object
    data_quality_suite = TestSuite(
        tests=[
            test_preset,
        ],
        color_options=color_options,
    )

    # Run the tests
    data_quality_suite.run(current_data=current_data, reference_data=reference_data)
    ```

    ### Explanation:
    The code above is updating the metrics and tests parameters and options. The metrics are updated to include DataDriftPreset, which is a metric that calculates the difference between the distribution of a feature in two data sets. The tests are updated to include DataDriftTestPreset, which is a test that checks if the data drift is statistically significant. The color options are also updated to match the color scheme used in the report.
