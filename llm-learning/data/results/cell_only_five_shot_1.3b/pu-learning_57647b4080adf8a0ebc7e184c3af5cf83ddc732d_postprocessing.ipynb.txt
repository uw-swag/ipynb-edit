```python
    # Description:
    # This code is used to implement a logistic regression model. The model is trained on the input data `x` and the target variable `s`.
    # The predicted probabilities of the target variable `y` are calculated using the trained model.
    # The predicted probabilities are then compared with a threshold `C`. If the predicted probability is greater than `C`, it is set to 1.0, otherwise, it is set to 0.0.
    # The predicted variable `y_hat` is created by converting the binary variable `y_prob_hat` to an integer variable.
