    The code you've provided is a cell from a Jupyter notebook that uses the DeepChecks library to find and remove special characters from a dataframe. 

    The DeepChecks library is a Python library for data quality checks, which is used to find and remove special characters from a dataframe. 

    The code is creating a dataframe with a dictionary, where each key-value pair represents a column name and a list of values. 

    The 'SpecialCharacters' function from the DeepChecks library is then used to find and remove special characters from the dataframe. 

    The result is a dataframe with all special characters removed.

    However, the code you've provided is not actually running the DeepChecks library. It's just creating a dataframe and using the 'SpecialCharacters' function to find and remove special characters from the dataframe. 

    If you want to run the DeepChecks library, you'll need to install it first, and then run the 'run' function on the dataframe. 

    Here's how you can run the DeepChecks library:

    ```python
    from deepchecks.tabular.checks import SpecialCharacters

    # Assuming 'df' is your dataframe
    SpecialCharacters().run(df)
    ```

    This will return a dataframe with all special characters removed.
