```python
    # Import necessary libraries
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
    from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

    # Load dataset
    df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

    # Data pipeline sections
    # Preprocess the data
    # This step includes cleaning, normalization, and other preprocessing steps
    # For example, you might need to convert categorical variables to numerical variables
    # and handle missing values

    # Split the dataset into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df.drop('target_column', axis=1), df['target_column'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Encode categorical variables
    le = LabelEncoder()
    X_train = X_train.apply(le.fit_transform)
    X_test = X_test.apply(le.fit_transform)

    # Create a data generator
    datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)

    # Train the model
    # This step includes training the model on the training data
    # You might need to adjust the model architecture, loss function, and other parameters
    # depending on the specific task and dataset

    # Evaluate the model
    # This step includes evaluating the model on the testing data
    # You might need to adjust the evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score
    # depending on the specific task and dataset

    # Predict on new data
    # This step includes using the trained model to make predictions on new data
    # You might need to adjust the new data preprocessing steps, such as resizing images, normalizing inputs, etc.
