The code you provided seems to be a mix of Python code and Jupyter notebook cells. The first part of the code is a Python installation and import for geopandas and kaggle, and it's followed by a map creation using Folium. The second part of the code is a map creation using Folium, but it's using a different data source and format. The third part of the code is a map creation using Folium, but it's using a different data source and format. The last part of the code is a map creation using Folium, but it's using a different data source and format.

The code you provided is not complete and it seems to be missing some parts. For example, it seems like the earthquake data is not being processed or visualized, and it's missing the code to create a map.

If you want to fix the code, you should add the code to create a map for the earthquake data. Here's a simple example of how you can do this:

```python
# Create a base map
m_5 = folium.Map(location=[35,136], tiles='cartodbpositron', zoom_start=5)

# Your code here: create a map
Choropleth(geo_data=prefectures.geometry.__geo_interface__, data=stats.density, key_on='feature.id', 
           fill_color='BuPu', 
           legend_name='population density and earthquake magnitude').add_to(m_5)

earthquakes['marker_color'] = pd.cut(earthquakes['Magnitude'], bins=4, 
                              labels=['yellow', 'orange', 'red', 'purple'])

# Your code here: Add a map to visualize earthquake depth
for idx, e in earthquakes.iterrows():    
    Circle(location=[e['Latitude'], e['Longitude']], 
           popup=("{} ({})").format(e['Magnitude'],e['DateTime'].year),
           radius=e['Magnitude']**5.5,           
           color=e['marker_color']).add_to(m_5)

# View the map
