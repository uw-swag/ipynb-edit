    # This step depends on the nature of the data and the problem at hand
    # For example, you might need to handle missing values, normalize or scale data,
    # convert categorical data to numerical, etc.

    # Splitting the data into features and target variable
    X = df.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
    y = df['target_variable']

    # Splitting the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)
