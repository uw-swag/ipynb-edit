```python
    # This is a Python code snippet that turns off auto quotes in Jupyter notebook.
    # This is useful when you're working in a Jupyter notebook and you want to avoid the auto quotes.

    # First, you need to import the necessary libraries.
    from IPython.display import display, HTML

    # Then, you can use the following code to turn off auto quotes.
    display(HTML('<style>.code_cell { display: block; background-color: #f8f8f8; } .prompt { display: none; }</style>'))
    ```
    This code will turn off auto quotes in the Jupyter notebook. It does this by adding a CSS style to the notebook that turns off the auto quotes.

    Please note that this code will only work in a Jupyter notebook environment. If you're not using a Jupyter notebook, you won't be able to use this code.
