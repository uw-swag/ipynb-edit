    The code you provided is a function that uses the Evidently library to detect data drift in a dataset. The function `detect_dataset_drift` takes in a reference dataset and a production dataset, along with a column mapping for the data, and returns a boolean indicating whether data drift has been detected.

    The function uses the `Profile` class from the `evidently` library to calculate a data profile of the dataset. The `DataDriftProfileSection` is then used to extract the metrics for each feature. The p-value for each feature is then compared to a confidence level to determine if the feature is drifting.

    The function also takes an optional parameter `get_ratio`, which if `True`, returns the ratio of drifted features to the total number of features.

    The function is then used to detect data drift in the reference dataset for the months of February to March, April to May, and June to July. The `threshold` parameter determines the minimum ratio of drifted features to non-drifted features that must be detected for a feature to be considered drifting.

    The function is then called with the appropriate parameters to perform the data drift detection.

    The code is written in Python and uses the pandas library for data manipulation and the evidently library for data profiling.
