    The code you provided is a simple example of using the Deepchecks library to perform a confusion matrix report on a dataset. The Deepchecks library is a Python library for data quality and security checks, which can be used to analyze and visualize the performance of machine learning models.

    The code first loads the iris dataset from sklearn, and then trains an AdaBoost classifier on the dataset. The classifier is then used to make predictions on the test set.

    The code then creates a Deepchecks dataset from the test set and the target variable. The ConfusionMatrixReport check is then run on this dataset, which will display a confusion matrix and other performance metrics.

    The code ends with a comment, indicating that the Deepchecks library is used to analyze the performance of the model.

    However, the code you provided is not actually deleting any notebooks. The code is creating a Deepchecks dataset and running a ConfusionMatrixReport check on it, but it's not actually deleting any notebooks. The notebooks are being used to visualize the results of the check, but they are not being deleted.

    If you want to delete the notebooks, you can use the `delete_notebook` function from the `deepchecks.notebook` module. Here's an example:

    ```python
    from deepchecks.notebook import delete_notebook
    delete_notebook(notebook_name='your_notebook_name')
    ```

    Please replace 'your_notebook_name' with the name of the notebook you want to delete.
