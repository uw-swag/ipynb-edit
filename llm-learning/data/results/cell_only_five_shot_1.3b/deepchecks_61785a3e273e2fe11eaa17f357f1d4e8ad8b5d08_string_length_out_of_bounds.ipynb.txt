    The function `string_length_out_of_bounds` is a function that checks for string length out of bounds. It takes a dataframe as input and returns a dataframe with the out-of-bounds strings.

    The function is used to find out-of-bounds strings in the "col1" column of the dataframe. The function is called with the dataframe and the number of percentiles to be considered (1000 in this case).

    The function is then used to find out-of-bounds strings in the "col1" column of the dataframe. The function is called with the dataframe and the number of percentiles to be considered (1000 in this case).
