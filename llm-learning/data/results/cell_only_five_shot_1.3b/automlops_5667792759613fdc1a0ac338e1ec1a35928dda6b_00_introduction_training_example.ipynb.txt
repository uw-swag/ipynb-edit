    This code is used to generate a pipeline in Google Cloud AutoML. The pipeline is set to run every Sunday at midnight.

    Please note that the `pipeline_params` should be a dictionary that contains the parameters for the pipeline. The parameters depend on the type of model you are training. For example, for a classification model, you might have parameters like `'model_type': 'classification', 'num_classes': 10`.

    Also, make sure to replace `PROJECT_ID` with your Google Cloud project ID.
