```python
    import pandas as pd

    # Assuming df is your DataFrame and 'date' is the column you want to update
    df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])

    # Now df['date'] is a datetime object, you can use it as you would with a normal datetime
    df['new_column'] = df['date'].dt.day
    ```
