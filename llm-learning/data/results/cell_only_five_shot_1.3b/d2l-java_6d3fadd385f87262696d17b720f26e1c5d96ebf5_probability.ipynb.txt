```python
    import tensorflow as tf

    # Load the data
    data = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.load_img('path_to_your_image.jpg')

    # Resize the image
    data = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.resize(data, (200, 200))

    # Convert the image to a numpy array
    data = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.img_to_array(data)

    # Normalize the image data
    data = data / 255.0

    # Reshape the data for the model
    data = data.reshape(1, 200, 200, 3)

    # Load the pre-trained model
    model = tf.keras.models.load_model('path_to_your_model.h5')

    # Use the model to predict the image
    prediction = model.predict(data)

    # Print the prediction
    print(prediction)
    ```
    This code will load an image, resize it, convert it to a numpy array, normalize it, reshape it for the model, and then use the model to predict the image. The prediction is then printed.

    Please replace `'path_to_your_image.jpg'` and `'path_to_your_model.h5'` with the actual paths to your image and model.

    Also, please note that the model used in this example is a simple model, and the image and model you use may not yield accurate results. You may need to adjust the model architecture, the image preprocessing, or the model training process to get the best results.
