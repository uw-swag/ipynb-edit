```
    from redpitaya.overlay.mercury import mercury as FPGA
    overlay = FPGA()
    LED = FPGA.led
    led1 = LED(1, 0)
    led1.write(1) 
    led1.write(0)
    import time
    for _ in range(10):
        led1.write(1)
        time.sleep(0.5)
        led1.write(0)
        time.sleep(0.5)
    led1.close()
    ```
    The code is already clean and does not contain any unnecessary changes. It is a simple example of using the FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) on the Red Pitaya platform. The LED on the FPGA is controlled to blink.
