    # Deleting notebooks
    ```
    The code provided is a simple example of using DeepChecks to detect and fix the IdentifierLeakage check in a DataFrame. The code is creating a DataFrame with random data, applying the IdentifierLeakage check, and then printing the results.

    However, if you want to delete the notebooks, you can do so by removing the lines of code that create and run the notebooks. Here's how you can do it:

    ```python
    # Deleting notebooks
    del df
    del dataset
    del my_check
    ```

    Please note that this will delete the DataFrame, the dataset, and the check, but not the notebooks themselves. If you want to delete the notebooks themselves, you'll need to ensure that they are not being used elsewhere in your code.
