    The code you provided is a Multinomial VAE (Variational Autoencoder) implementation in Python. The file names are not updated as per your request. However, the main changes are:

    1. The function names are changed from `readfile_func`, `calculate_cost_func`, `log_gradient_func`, and `gradient_descent_func` to `read_data_func`, `calculate_cost_func`, `log_gradient_func`, and `gradient_descent_func` respectively.
    2. The variable names are changed from `X`, `Y`, `c`, `m`, `alpha`, `ep`, and `max_iter` to `x_train`, `y_train`, `c_val`, `m_val`, `alpha_val`, `ep_val`, and `max_iter_val` respectively.
    3. The function calls in the `buildModel_func` are changed from `readfile_func(filename)` to `read_data_func(filename)`.
    4. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is changed to `if __name__ == "__main__":`.
    5. The `x = input("Enter the number!")` line is changed to `x = int(input("Enter the number!"))`.
    6. The `print(x*m+c)` line is changed to `print(x*m_val+c_val)`.

    Please note that the changes are based on the assumption that the original code was intended to be a Multinomial VAE implementation. If the original code was not intended to be a Multinomial VAE, the changes may not be necessary.
