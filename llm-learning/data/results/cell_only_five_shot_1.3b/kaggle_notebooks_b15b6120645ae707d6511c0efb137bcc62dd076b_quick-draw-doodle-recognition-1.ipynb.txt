    The code you provided is a complete implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. It uses the Keras library in Python, which is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.

    The code is divided into several sections:

    1. Configuration parameters: This section sets the parameters for the model, such as the image size, number of labels, and the number of images per label.

    2. Data loading and preprocessing: This section reads the training data, preprocesses it, and splits it into training, validation, and test sets.

    3. Model definition: This section defines the CNN model, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, dropout layers, and dense layers.

    4. Model training: This section trains the model on the training data, and saves the best model weights.

    5. Model evaluation: This section evaluates the model on the test data and prints the classification report.

    6. Prediction: This section uses the trained model to make predictions on the test data.

    The code also includes additional functions for image processing, such as getting the line between two points, displaying the images, and getting the image from a label.

    The final part of the code is a summary of the results, including the number of correct predictions and the top 10 most common labels.

    Please note that the code is a simplified version of the original code and may not work as expected. The original code was not provided in the question.
