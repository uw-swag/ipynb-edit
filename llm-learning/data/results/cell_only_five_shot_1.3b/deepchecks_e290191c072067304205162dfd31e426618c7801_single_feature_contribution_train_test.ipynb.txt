    ### Example 1:
    ### Description:
    ### This is an example of a Python code that uses the sklearn library to perform a logistic regression on a simple dataset.

    ### Code:
    ```python
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

    # Load the iris dataset
    iris = load_iris()

    # Split the dataset into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris.data, iris.target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Create a Logistic Regression model
    model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions on the testing set
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)

    # Print the accuracy of the model
    print("Accuracy:", model.score(X_test, y_test))
    ```

    ### Example 2:
    ### Description:
    ### This is an example of a Python code that uses the sklearn library to perform a decision tree classification on a simple dataset.

    ### Code:
    ```python
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

    # Load the iris dataset
    iris = load_iris()

    # Split the dataset into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris.data, iris.target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Create a Decision Tree Classifier model
    model = DecisionTreeClassifier()

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train
