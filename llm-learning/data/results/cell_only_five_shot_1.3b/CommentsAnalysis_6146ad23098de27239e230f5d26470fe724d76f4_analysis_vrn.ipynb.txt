    The code you've provided seems to be a mix of Python and Jupyter notebook cells. It's not clear what the purpose of these cells are, but they seem to be part of a larger script or a Jupyter notebook. Here's a brief explanation of what each part of the code does:

1. `comments_df.from_id.nunique()`: This line of code counts the unique number of 'from_id' values in the 'comments_df' DataFrame.

2. `comments_df.shape`: This line of code returns the shape of the 'comments_df' DataFrame, which is the number of rows and columns.

3. `users_with_fac[0]`: This line of code is trying to access the first element of the 'users_with_fac' list. However, 'users_with_fac' is not defined in the provided code.

4. `with open('meta_data/vrn_fac.txt', 'w') as f:`: This line of code opens a file named 'vrn_fac.txt' in the 'meta_data' directory for writing.

5. `ing, gum`: These lines are trying to read from a file named 'vrn_fac.txt' and split the lines into 'ing' and 'gum' lists. However, 'vrn_fac.txt' is not defined in the provided code.

6. `len(ing), len(gum)`: This line of code returns the lengths of the 'ing' and 'gum' lists.

7. `ing[:3], gum[:3]`: These lines are trying to print the first three elements of the 'ing' and 'gum' lists. However, these lists are not defined in the provided code.

8. `users_df.sex.value_counts(True)`: This line of code returns the value counts of the 'sex' column in the 'users_df' DataFrame, sorted in descending order.

9. `delta = users_vc[1] - users_vc[0]`: This line of code calculates the difference between the last value in 'users_vc' and the first value in 'users_vc'.
