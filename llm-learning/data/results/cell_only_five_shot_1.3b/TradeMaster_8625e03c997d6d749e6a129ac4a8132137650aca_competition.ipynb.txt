    ## Project Overview

    This project is a part of the Machine Learning course. The goal of the project is to implement a reinforcement learning algorithm to navigate a simulated environment.

    ## Getting Started

    To get started, you need to install the necessary libraries. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install jupyter
    ```

    ## Usage

    The usage of the project is straightforward. You can run the Jupyter notebook to see the implementation of the reinforcement learning algorithm.
