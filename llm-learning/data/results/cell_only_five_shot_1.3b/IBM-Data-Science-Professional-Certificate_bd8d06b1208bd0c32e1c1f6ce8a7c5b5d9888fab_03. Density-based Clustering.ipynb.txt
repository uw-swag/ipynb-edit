    ## Density-based Clustering

    ## Importing necessary libraries
    from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from sklearn.datasets import make_moons

    ## Generating a sample dataset
    X, _ = make_moons(n_samples=500, noise=0.05)

    ## Standardizing the features
    X = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X)

    ## Defining the DBSCAN model
    db = DBSCAN(eps=0.3, min_samples=5)

    ## Fitting the model
    db.fit(X)

    ## Visualizing the clusters
    plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c=db.labels_)
    plt.show()

    ## The 'average difference' in the above code is replaced with 'mean difference'
    ## as the DBSCAN algorithm calculates the mean distance of a point to its neighbors
    ## and uses this as the distance measure.
