    # This is an example of how to reorganize your code and move GitBook docs to your repository.

    # First, let's move your GitBook docs to your repository.
    # You can use the following command to do this:

    # This is a placeholder for the command to move your GitBook docs to your repository.
    # Replace 'your_gitbook_path' with the path to your GitBook directory.
    # Replace 'your_repo_path' with the path to your repository.

    # $ mv your_gitbook_path/* your_repo_path/

    # Now, let's reorganize your code.
    # This is a placeholder for the code to be reorganized.
    # Replace 'your_code_here' with the code you want to be reorganized.

    # $ your_code_here

    # Now, let's move your reorganized code to your repository.
    # This is a placeholder for the command to move your reorganized code to your repository.
    # Replace 'your_repo_path' with the path to your repository.

    # $ mv your_repo_path/your_reorganized_code_here your_repo_path/

    # Now, you can run your code in your repository.
    # This is a placeholder for the command to run your code.
    # Replace 'your_code_here' with the code you want to run.

    # $ your_code_here

    # Now, you can commit and push your changes to your repository.
    # This is a placeholder for the command to commit and push your changes.
    # Replace 'your_commit_message' with the commit message you want to use.

    # $ git add .
    # $ git commit -m 'your_commit_message'
    # $ git push origin master

    # Now, you have successfully moved your GitBook docs to your repository and reorganized your code.
    ```

    Please replace the placeholders with your actual commands and commit message.
