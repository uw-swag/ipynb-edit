    The code you've provided is a TensorFlow 2.x code snippet for training a VGG16 model on a dataset. The code includes the following steps:

1. It imports necessary libraries and sets up the necessary directories.
2. It loads the VGG16 model and sets up the training and validation data paths.
3. It defines the batch size and number of epochs for training.
4. It fine-tunes the model on the training data.
5. It trains the model for a specified number of epochs.
6. It saves the model weights after each epoch.
7. It uses the trained model to predict the labels for the validation data.
8. It calculates the log loss for the predictions.
9. It saves the predictions to a CSV file.

The code is set up to run in a Jupyter notebook environment, and it uses TensorFlow 2.x. The TensorFlow version used in this code is 2.4.1.
