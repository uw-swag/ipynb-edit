```python
    from fastbook import *
    from fastai.vision.all import *

    # Define the data block
    dblock = DataBlock(
        blocks=(ImageBlock, LabelBlock), 
        get_items=get_image_files, 
        splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed=42),
        get_y=parent_label,
        item_tfms=Resize(224),
        batch_tfms=aug_transforms(min_scale=0.75, max_scale=1.0, rotations=15, max_warp=0, p=0.8),
        batch_size=32
    )

    # Create the data loaders
    dls = dblock.dataloaders(path)
    learn = Learner(dls, model, loss_func, metrics=metrics)
    learn.fine_tune(n_epochs=5)
    ```
    This code block is used to create a data block for fastai library. The data block is used to load and preprocess the data. The data block is then used to create a learner, which is a model that can be trained. The learner is then fine-tuned for 5 epochs.
