    The code above is a Python script that uses the imblearn library to perform majority class undersampling. 

    The `oversamplingSMOTE` function is used to apply SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to the given feature set. SMOTE is a type of over-sampling method that uses the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to create new samples.

    The `datasetBalancing` function is used to apply either SMOTE or ADASYN (Anomaly Detection as a Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to the given feature set.

    The `SMOTE` class from the imblearn library is used to create synthetic samples. The `fit_sample` method of the `SMOTE` class is used to apply the over-sampling to the given feature set.

    The `ADASYN` class from the imblearn library is used to create synthetic samples. The `fit_sample` method of the `ADASYN` class is used to apply the over-sampling to the given feature set.

    The `SMOTE` and `ADASYN` classes are imported from the imblearn library.

    The `SMOTE` and `ADASYN` classes are used to create synthetic samples from the given feature set. The `fit_sample` method of the `SMOTE` and `ADASYN` classes is used to apply the over-sampling to the given feature set.
