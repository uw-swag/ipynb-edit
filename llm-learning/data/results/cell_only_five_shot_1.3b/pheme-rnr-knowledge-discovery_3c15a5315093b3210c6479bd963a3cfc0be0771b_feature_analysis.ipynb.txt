```python
    # Importing necessary libraries
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np

    # Loading the dataset
    df = pd.read_csv('twitter_data.csv')

    # Calculating the proportion of tweets with a shared hashtag
    hashtag_proportion = df['hashtags'].apply(lambda x: len(x.split('#'))).sum() / len(df)

    print(f'The proportion of tweets with a shared hashtag is {hashtag_proportion}')
    ```
    This code will calculate the proportion of tweets in the dataset that have a shared hashtag. The proportion is calculated by splitting each tweet by '#' and counting the number of splits. The sum of these counts is divided by the total number of tweets to get the proportion.
