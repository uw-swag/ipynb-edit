    ### Response:
    Here is a new feature that we have added to the project. This feature is a simple function that calculates the square of a number.

    ```python
    def square(number):
        return number ** 2

    # Test the function
    print(square(10))  # Output: 100
    ```

    This feature is added to the project to make it more efficient and easier to understand.
