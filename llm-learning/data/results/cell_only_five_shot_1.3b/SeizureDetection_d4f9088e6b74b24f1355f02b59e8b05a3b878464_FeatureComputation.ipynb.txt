The issue with the code is that it seems to be missing the definition of the function `computeCorrelation`. This function is used to calculate the correlation between the left and right hemispheres. If this function is not defined, the code will throw an error.

Here is the definition of the function:

```python
def computeCorrelation(left, right):
    corr = np.corrcoef(left, right)[0, 1]
    return corr
```

You can add this function definition to your code. If you're using a Jupyter notebook, you can do this by adding a new cell at the bottom of your notebook and pasting the function definition. If you're using a Python script, you can add this function definition at the end of your script.

Please note that the `computeCorrelation` function is a simple function that calculates the correlation between two arrays. It's not a standard function in the `numpy` library, so you might need to adjust it according to your needs.
