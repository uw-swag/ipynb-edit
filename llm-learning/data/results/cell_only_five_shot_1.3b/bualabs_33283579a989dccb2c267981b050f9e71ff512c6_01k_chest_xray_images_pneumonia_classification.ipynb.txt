    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook that uses the PyTorch and Transformers libraries to train a model for image classification on chest X-ray images. The model is trained on the Pneumonia dataset, which is a public dataset for chest X-ray images.

    The code adjusts the image size to 384x384 pixels, which is a commonly used size for chest X-ray images. This is done by resizing the images using the `RandomResizedCrop` transform. The `RandomResizedCrop` transform randomly resizes the image and then crops it to the specified size.

    The code also adds a description to the code cells. The description is a brief explanation of what the code does, the purpose of the model, and the specific parameters used.

    The code also includes a description of the dataset used, which is the Pneumonia dataset, a public chest X-ray dataset. The dataset contains chest X-ray images of two types of chest X-ray findings: Normal and Pneumonia.

    The code also includes a description of the model used, which is a convolutional neural network with a residual learning framework. The model is trained using the AdamW optimizer, which is a variant of Adam that is designed to be faster and more accurate.

    The code also includes a description of the training process, which is done using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a learning rate scheduler. The learning rate is reduced by a factor of 0.1 after every 10 epochs.

    The code also includes a description of the evaluation metrics, which are the accuracy, F1 score, and recall score. These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model.

    The code also includes a description of the final model, which is the model that was trained on the Pneumonia dataset.
