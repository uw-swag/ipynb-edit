The code you provided seems to be a script for training a machine learning model using the Alpaca Trade API. The script is designed to download and preprocess data, train a model, and then test the model.

However, there are a few issues with the code:

1. The `build_environment` function is not defined. This function is used to create environments for training, validation, and testing. It should be defined before the code.

2. The `build_trainer` function is not defined. This function is used to create a trainer for a specific environment. It should be defined before the code.

3. The `cfg.dump` line is not indented correctly. It should be placed under the `if` statement that checks the `task_name`.

4. The `trainer.train_and_valid()` and `trainer.test()` lines are not indented correctly. They should be placed under the `if` or `elif` statement that checks the `task_name`.

5. The `trainer.test()` line is not indented correctly. It should be placed under the `if` or `elif` statement that checks the `task_name`.

6. The `print("test end")` line is not indented correctly. It should be placed under the `if` or `elif` statement that checks the `task_name`.

7. The `print('win rate is: ', sum(r > 0 for r in daily_return_list) / len(daily_return_list))` line is not indented correctly. It should be placed under the `if` or `elif` statement that checks the `task_name`.

8. The `if` or `elif` statement that checks the `task_name` is not indented correctly. It should be placed under the `if` or `elif` statement that checks the `task_name`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# ... existing code ...

if task_name.startswith("style_test"):
    trainers = []
    for env in test_style_environments:
        trainer = build_trainer(cfg, default_args=dict(train_environment=train_environment,
