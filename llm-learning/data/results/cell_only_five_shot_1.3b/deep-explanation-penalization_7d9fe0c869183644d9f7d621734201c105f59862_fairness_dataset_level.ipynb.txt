    ## Comparing Net Versions

    This notebook compares the versions of the libraries used in the original project.

    ### Libraries Used

    - `pandas`: Data manipulation library
    - `numpy`: Scientific computing library
    - `scikit-learn`: Machine learning library
    - `mmtfPyspark`: Python library for MMTF data
    - `matplotlib`: Data visualization library
    - `autograd`: Automatic differentiation library
    - `pyspark`: Apache Spark library
    - `github-clone`: Python library for cloning GitHub repositories

    ### Comparison

    - `pandas`: Used for data manipulation, but not for data analysis.
    - `numpy`: Used for numerical computations, but not for data analysis.
    - `scikit-learn`: Used for machine learning, but not for data analysis.
    - `mmtfPyspark`: Used for MMTF data, but not for data analysis.
    - `matplotlib`: Used for data visualization, but not for data analysis.
    - `autograd`: Used for automatic differentiation, but not for data analysis.
    - `pyspark`: Used for Apache Spark, but not for data analysis.
    - `github-clone`: Used for cloning GitHub repositories, but not for data analysis.

    ### Future Improvements

    - The comparison can be expanded to include other libraries used in the project.
    - The comparison can be made more detailed, with more information about the versions used.
    - The comparison can be made more interactive, with options for users to select different versions to compare.
