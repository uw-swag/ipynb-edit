    ### ConversationSummaryBufferMemory

    The `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` is a memory object that is used to store the conversation context. It is used in the `ConversationSummary` class to store the conversation context and predict the next message.

    Here is an example of how to use the `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory`:

    ```python
    from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryBufferMemory

    memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(
        llm=llm,
        max_token_limit=50,
    )

    memory.save_context(
        {"input": "Hello"},
        {"output": "What's up"},
    )

    memory.save_context(
        {"input": "Not much, just hanging"},
        {"output": "Cool"},
    )

    memory.save_context(
        {"input": "What is on the schedule today?"},
        {"output": f"{news}"},
    )

    conversation.predict(input="What would be a good demo to show?")
    ```

    The `save_context` method is used to save the conversation context. The first parameter is the input to the system, and the second parameter is the expected output.

    The `predict` method is used to predict the next message based on the conversation context.

    The `llm` parameter is the language model that will be used to predict the next message.

    The `max_token_limit` parameter is the maximum number of tokens that the system can use in the conversation context.
