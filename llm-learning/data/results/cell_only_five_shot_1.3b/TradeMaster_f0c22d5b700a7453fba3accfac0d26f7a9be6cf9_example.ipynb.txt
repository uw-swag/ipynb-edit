```python
    # Importing necessary libraries
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score

    # Assuming you have a dataframe df with your data
    df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

    # Split the data into features and target variable
    X = df.drop('target_column', axis=1)
    y = df['target_column']

    # Train the model on the data
    # model = your_model
    # model.fit(X, y)

    # Predict the target variable for the data
    # y_pred = model.predict(X)

    # Evaluate the model
    print(confusion_matrix(y, y_pred))
    print(classification_report(y, y_pred))
    print(accuracy_score(y, y_pred))
    ```
    This code will print the confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score of your model.
