    This code will perform KNN classification on a dataset. The dataset is loaded from a CSV file, the features are standardized, and then the dataset is split into a training set and a test set. The KNN classifier is created and fitted to the training data, and then the classifier is used to predict the target variable for the test set. The accuracy of the model is then printed.
