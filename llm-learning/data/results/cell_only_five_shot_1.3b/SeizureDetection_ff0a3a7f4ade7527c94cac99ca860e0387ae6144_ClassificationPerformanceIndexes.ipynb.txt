    The code you provided is a Python script for implementing the majority class undersampling technique. Majority class undersampling is a type of over-sampling where the minority class is undersampled to balance the dataset.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The function `classificationPerformanceIndexes` calculates several performance indexes for a binary classification problem.
    - The function `printClassificationPerformanceIndexes` prints these indexes.

    The code then uses these functions to calculate the performance indexes for a binary classification problem.

    The function `metrics.confusion_matrix` is used to create a confusion matrix, which is a table that describes the performance of a classification model on a set of test data for which the true values are known.

    The function `metrics.accuracy_score`, `metrics.f1_score`, `metrics.matthews_corrcoef`, and `metrics.cohen_kappa_score` are used to calculate the performance indexes.

    The function `ravel` is used to flatten the confusion matrix, and the function `ravel` is used to flatten the true and predicted arrays.

    The function `metrics.accuracy_score`, `metrics.f1_score`, `metrics.matthews_corrcoef`, and `metrics.cohen_kappa_score` are used to calculate the performance indexes.
