```python
    import requests
    import zipfile
    import io
    import pandas as pd

    content = requests.get("https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/275/bike+sharing+dataset.zip").content
    with zipfile.ZipFile(io.BytesIO(content)) as arc:
        raw_data = pd.read_csv(arc.open("hour.csv"), header=0, sep=',', parse_dates=['dteday'], index_col='dteday')
    ```

    The code above will download the bike dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and then read the `hour.csv` file into a pandas DataFrame. The `parse_dates` parameter is used to convert the `dteday` column into a datetime index.

    However, if you want to skip SSL verification for the dataset, you can do so by setting the `verify` parameter to `False` in the `requests.get()` function. This will bypass the SSL certificate verification.

    ```python
    content = requests.get("https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/275/bike+sharing+dataset.zip", verify=False).content
    with zipfile.ZipFile(io.BytesIO(content)) as arc:
        raw_data = pd.read_csv(arc.open("hour.csv"), header=0, sep=',', parse_dates=['dteday'], index_col='dteday')
    ```

    Please note that this is not recommended for production environments as it can expose your system to security risks. It's best to use SSL certificates for all requests, unless you have a good reason not to.
