```
    def total_variation_loss(x):
        h, w = x.get_shape().as_list()[1], x.get_shape().as_list()[2]
        dx = tf.square(x[:, :h-1, :w-1, :] - x[:, :h-1, 1:, :])
        dy = tf.square(x[:, :h-1, :w-1, :] - x[:, 1:, :w-1, :])
        return tf.reduce_sum(tf.pow(dx + dy, 1.25))

    with tf.Session(graph=g) as sess, g.device('/cpu:0'):
        tv_loss = total_variation_loss(net_input)
    ```

    ### Explanation:
    The issue with the total variation loss function is that it is trying to get the shape of the tensor as a list, but the shape is a tuple. The function should be called with the shape as a tuple (h, w) instead of as a list.

    The corrected code is:

    ```
    def total_variation_loss(x):
        h, w = x.get_shape().as_list()[1], x.get_shape().as_list()[2]
        dx = tf.square(x[:, :h-1, :w-1, :] - x[:, :h-1, 1:, :])
        dy = tf.square(x[:, :h-1, :w-1, :] - x[:, 1:, :w-1, :])
        return tf.reduce_sum(tf.pow(dx + dy, 1.25))

    with tf.Session(graph=g) as sess, g.device('/cpu:0'):
        tv_loss = total_variation_loss(net_input)
    ```

    This code will work as expected.
