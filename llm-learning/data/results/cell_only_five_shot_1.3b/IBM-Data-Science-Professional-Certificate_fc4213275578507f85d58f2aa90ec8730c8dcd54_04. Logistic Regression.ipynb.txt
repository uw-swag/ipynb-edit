```python
    # Import necessary libraries
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

    # Load the dataset
    df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

    # Preprocess the data
    # This is a placeholder, replace it with your actual preprocessing steps
    df = df.dropna()
    df = pd.get_dummies(df)

    # Split the data into features and target variable
    X = df.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
    y = df['target_variable']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Standardize the features
    sc = StandardScaler()
    X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = sc.transform(X_test)

    # Create a Logistic Regression model
    model = LogisticRegression()

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model
    print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
    print('Accuracy:', accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))

    # Save the model
    import joblib
    joblib.dump(model, 'logistic_regression_model.pkl')
    ```
    This is a simple logistic regression model. You can adjust the code according to your needs.
