    The code you provided is a part of a larger process that involves several steps, including data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation. Here's a brief overview of what each part of the code does:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: This involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and converting categorical variables into numerical ones.

2. **Model Training**: The code uses a regression model to predict the 'bicycle demand' for the 'production' data.

3. **Performance Evaluation**: The code calculates various performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for the predictions.

4. **Dashboard Generation**: The code generates a dashboard that visualizes the performance of the model. The dashboard includes tabs for regression performance, target drift, and data drift.

5. **Weekly Updates**: The code calculates the performance metrics for each week of the production data.

6. **Saving the Dashboard**: The code saves the dashboard to HTML files for later use.
