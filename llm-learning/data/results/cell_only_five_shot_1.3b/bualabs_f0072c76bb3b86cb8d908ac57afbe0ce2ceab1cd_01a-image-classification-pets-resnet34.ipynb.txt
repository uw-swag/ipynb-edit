    ### Response:
    The code cell you provided is a string that contains a percentage value. However, it seems like you're trying to represent a percentage as a number. If you're trying to represent a percentage as a decimal, you should use a float. For example, you can use 94.0 instead of "94%". If you're trying to represent a percentage as a percentage, you should use a string. For example, you can use "94%" instead of "94%".
