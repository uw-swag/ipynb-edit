    The code you provided is a part of a larger process that involves several steps, including data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and feature extraction. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

    1. `featureNormalization(ft)`: This function normalizes the features in the dataframe `ft`. The normalization process scales the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

    2. `dimentionalityReduction(features, pca_tolerance)`: This function applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the features. The number of components to keep is specified by the `pca_tolerance` parameter.

    3. `read_and_store_data(dataset, sample_rate)`: This function reads a dataset from a file, applies a sample rate to it, and then stores the result in a new file.

    4. `leftRightHemisphericChannels(df)`: This function is a placeholder for a function that might be used to separate the left and right hemispheric channels from a dataset.

    5. `featureExtraction(ndf, sample_rate, step)`: This function is a placeholder for a function that might be used to extract features from a dataset.
