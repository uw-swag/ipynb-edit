    ## Updating Project Notes

    The project notes have been updated to reflect the changes made to the data. The data cleaning process has been performed to ensure that the data is in a suitable format for further analysis.

    The data cleaning process includes:

    1. Replacing values in the 'min_playtime' column that are greater than 525 with 525.
    2. Replacing values in the 'min_playtime' column that are less than 10 with 10.
    3. Replacing values in the 'max_playtime' column that are greater than 1100 with 1100.
    4. Replacing values in the 'max_playtime' column that are less than 10 with 10.
    5. Replacing values in the 'max_players' column that are greater than 40 with 40.
    6. Replacing values in the 'max_players' column that are less than 2 with 2.
    7. Replacing values in the 'min_players' column that are less than 1 with 1.

    The updated data is then saved to a new CSV file named 'bg_clean30.csv'.

    The updated project notes reflect the changes made to the data cleaning process, which is a crucial step in data preparation for further analysis.
