```
    pipeline(**pipeline_params)
    ```
    This code will run the pipeline with the provided parameters. The pipeline consists of two tasks:

    1. The first task, `finetune_t5_model`, will finetune a Flan-T5 model on a dataset.
    2. The second task, `deploy_and_test_model`, will deploy the finetuned model to a Vertex AI endpoint, and then run a prediction test.

    The parameters for the pipeline are defined in the `pipeline_params` dictionary. You can modify these parameters to customize the pipeline according to your needs.

    Please replace `SERVICE_ACCOUNT`, `PROJECT_ID`, `BUCKET_URI`, `SERVING_IMAGE` with your actual values.

    Note: This code assumes that you have the necessary permissions to run these tasks and access the necessary resources.
