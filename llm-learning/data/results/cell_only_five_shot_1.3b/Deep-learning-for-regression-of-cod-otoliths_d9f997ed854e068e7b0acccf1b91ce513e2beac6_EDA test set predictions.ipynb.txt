    ### Response:
    The LaTeX code has been added to the code cells. The LaTeX syntax is used to display mathematical expressions and formulas in a document. The `$` symbol is used to denote LaTeX commands. The `{` and `}` symbols are used to enclose the LaTeX code, and the `\` symbol is used to escape special LaTeX characters.

    The original code was not changing the outliers table, but the LaTeX code was added to display the results in a more readable format.
