    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook that uses the Deep Java Library (DJL) for deep learning. The notebook is designed to train a model on the FashionMnist dataset, and it also includes the implementation of a batch normalization block.

    The batch normalization block is a part of the model that normalizes the inputs to a layer. It does this by calculating the mean and variance of the inputs, normalizing the inputs, and shifting and scaling the outputs.

    The batch normalization block is used in the forward method of the BatchNormBlock class, which is called in the forward method of the model.

    The model is trained for a number of epochs, and the loss and accuracy of the model are tracked. The loss is tracked separately from the accuracy, as the accuracy is not a part of the loss function.

    The notebook also includes a line plot that shows the loss and accuracy over the epochs.

    The notebook is designed to be run in a Jupyter notebook environment. The code is written in Java, and it uses the DJL library to perform deep learning.
