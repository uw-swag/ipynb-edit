    # Upgrading to DL灵感（DJL）0.13.0

    DJL is a high-level API for deep learning, which is a key component of the current state of the Deep Java Library (DJL).

    The main changes in this version are:

    - The `CenteredLayer` class has been renamed to `AbstractBlock`.
    - The `forwardInternal` method has been renamed to `forward`.
    - The `getOutputShapes` method has been renamed to `getOutputShape`.
    - The `MyLinear` class has been renamed to `AbstractBlock`.
    - The `forwardInternal` method has been renamed to `forward`.
    - The `getOutputShapes` method has been renamed to `getOutputShape`.

    Please note that the `forward` method in the `MyLinear` class is not a public method anymore. This is because the `forward` method is a protected method in the `AbstractBlock` class, and it is not recommended to make it public.

    If you are using the DJL 0.13.0, you should update your code to use the new classes and methods.

    For more information, please refer to the DJL 0.13.0 release notes: https://github.com/deepjavalibrary/djl/releases/tag/v0.13.0

    Thank you for your contribution to the DJL project.
