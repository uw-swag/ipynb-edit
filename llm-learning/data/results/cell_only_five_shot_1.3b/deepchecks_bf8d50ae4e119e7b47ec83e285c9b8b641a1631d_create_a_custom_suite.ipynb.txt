The code you provided is used to create a suite of checks for data leakage in deepchecks, a Python library for data quality checks. The suite is customized by removing all conditions for the SingleFeatureContributionTrainTest and updating the suite's name.

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. `from deepchecks.suites import data_leakage_suite`: This line imports the data_leakage_suite function from the deepchecks.suites module. This function is used to create a suite of checks for data leakage.

2. `customized_suite = data_leakage_suite()`: This line creates a new suite of checks for data leakage.

3. `customized_suite[2].clean_conditions()`: This line removes all conditions from the third check in the suite.

4. `customized_suite.name = 'New Data Methodology Suite'`: This line sets the name of the suite to 'New Data Methodology Suite'.

5. `print(customized_suite)`: This line prints the suite to the console.

Please note that the code provided is a part of a larger codebase and it's not clear what the purpose of the code is. The code is used to customize a suite of checks for data leakage in deepchecks, but it's not clear what the purpose of the code is.
