    The code you provided is a set of instructions for a machine learning project. It includes importing necessary libraries, setting up a training environment, defining a model, training the model, and evaluating the model.

    However, the code you provided is not complete and does not provide a complete solution to the problem. It is missing the definition of the functions `get_batches`, `get_classes`, `Adam`, and `l2`.

    The complete code would look something like this:

    ```python
    from theano.sandbox import cuda
    cuda.use('gpu1')
    %matplotlib inline
    from __future__ import print_function, division
    from keras.optimizers import Adam
    from keras.regularizers import l2
    from keras.models import Sequential
    from keras.layers import BatchNormalization, Flatten, Dense, Convolution2D, MaxPooling2D
    from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
    import numpy as np
    import os
    import shutil
    from glob import glob
    from IPython.display import FileLink

    # Define your functions here

    def get_batches(path, batch_size=32, shuffle=True):
        # Your implementation here

    def get_classes(path):
        # Your implementation here

    def Adam():
        # Your implementation here

    def l2(lr=0.01):
        # Your implementation here

    # Your main code here
    ```

    Please replace the `# Your implementation here` comments with the actual code you need.

    Also, please note that the code you provided is a part of a larger codebase and it's not clear what the purpose of this code is. It seems to be a part of a larger machine learning project, but the code is not complete and does not provide a complete solution to the problem.
