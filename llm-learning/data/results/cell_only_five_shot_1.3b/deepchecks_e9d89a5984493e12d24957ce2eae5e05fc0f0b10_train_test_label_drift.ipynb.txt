    # Refactor the code to handle label drift
    # This is a placeholder for the refactoring process
    # You need to implement the refactoring logic here
    # For example, you can use a rolling window to detect label drift
    # and then apply the appropriate transformations or models to handle the drift

    # Refactor the code to generate a printable PDF
    # This is a placeholder for the PDF generation process
    # You need to implement the PDF generation logic here
    # For example, you can use the matplotlib library to generate a PDF
    # and save it to a file
