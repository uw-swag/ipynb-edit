    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook. The commit message "Updated tutorials to support new Tab/Section interface" suggests that the tutorials are being updated to use a new interface for tabs and sections.

    The new interface for tabs and sections in Jupyter notebooks is a more user-friendly and flexible way to organize and manage the notebook's content. The tabs and sections allow you to organize your notebook's content into different sections, each with its own set of cells. This makes it easier to navigate and understand the content of your notebook.

    The updated code is using the new interface for tabs and sections to calculate the regression performance, target drift, and data drift dashboards. The regression performance tab displays the performance metrics of a regression model, while the target drift and data drift tabs provide detailed insights into the drift of the target variable and the data respectively.

    The code also calculates the profile of the data drift, which provides a detailed report of the data drift. The profile includes information about the distribution of the numerical and categorical features, the correlation between the features, and the statistical significance of the features.
