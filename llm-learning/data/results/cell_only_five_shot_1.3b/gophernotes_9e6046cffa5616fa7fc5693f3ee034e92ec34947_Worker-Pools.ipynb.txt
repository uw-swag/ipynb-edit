    ### Response:
    ```Dockerfile
    # Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
    FROM python:3.7-slim

    # Set the working directory in the container to /app
    WORKDIR /app

    # Add the current directory contents into the container at /app
    ADD . /app

    # Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
    RUN pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org -r requirements.txt

    # Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
    EXPOSE 80

    # Run app.py when the container launches
    CMD ["python", "app.py"]
    ```

    This Dockerfile uses the official Python 3.7 image and sets the working directory to /app. It then adds the current directory contents into the container at /app and installs any packages specified in requirements.txt. The EXPOSE instruction makes port 80 available to the outside world. The CMD instruction specifies that the container should run the python app.py command when it launches.
