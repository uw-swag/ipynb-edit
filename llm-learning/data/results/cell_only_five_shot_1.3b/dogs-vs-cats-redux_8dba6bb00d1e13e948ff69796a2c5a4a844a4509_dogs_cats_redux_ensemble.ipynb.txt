    The ResNet architecture is a type of deep learning model that is widely used in various applications such as image classification, object detection, and more. It consists of a series of convolutional and pooling layers, and it has been shown to be effective in various image classification tasks.

    The ResNet architecture is composed of three main parts:

    1. The first part is the convolutional layer, which applies a set of filters to the input. The number of filters is usually 64, but it can be increased or decreased.

    2. The second part is the batch normalization layer, which normalizes the activations of the previous layer at each batch.

    3. The third part is the activation function, which applies a non-linear transformation to the output of the previous layer.

    The ResNet architecture is also known as Residual Networks, which is a variant of the standard ResNet architecture. In ResNet, the shortcut connection between layers is used to reduce the amount of parameters in the model, which can help to speed up the training process.
