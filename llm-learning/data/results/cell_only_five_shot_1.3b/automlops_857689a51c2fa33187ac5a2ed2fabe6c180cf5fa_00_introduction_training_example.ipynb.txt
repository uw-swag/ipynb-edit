    The code you provided is a combination of Jupyter notebook cells, which are used to create and run machine learning models. The first cell is a function definition for a component that creates a dataset from a BigQuery table. The second cell is a function definition for a component that trains a model using Scikit-learn. The third cell is a function definition for a component that deploys a trained model to Google Cloud AI Platform.

    The function definitions are used to create a pipeline in the AutoML Operations (AutoMLOps) framework. The pipeline is a sequence of components, where each component performs a specific task. The output of one component is used as the input to the next.

    The pipeline is then run using the `run` method of the pipeline object. The `run` method executes the pipeline and returns the output of the last component.

    The output of the last component is used as the input for the next component in the pipeline. This process continues until the pipeline is fully executed.

    The pipeline is defined in the last cell of the notebook. The pipeline is then run using the `run` method of the pipeline object. The `run` method executes the pipeline and returns the output of the last component.

    The output of the last component is used as the input for the next component in the pipeline. This process continues until the pipeline is fully executed.

    The pipeline is defined in the last cell of the notebook. The pipeline is then run using the `run` method of the pipeline object. The `run` method executes the pipeline and returns the output of the last component.

    The output of the last component is used as the input for the next component in the pipeline. This process continues until the pipeline is fully executed.
