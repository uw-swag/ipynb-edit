    ## Notebook Comparison

    This notebook compares the versions of the models that were trained using different hyperparameters and weights. The results are presented in a tabular format, with each row representing a different model and each column representing a different hyperparameter or weight.

    The hyperparameters and weights are stored in separate pickle files, which are loaded into pandas dataframes and concatenated into a single dataframe. The shape of the dataframe is printed at the end, indicating the total number of models and their corresponding hyperparameters and weights.

    The notebook also includes a section for visualizing the results, which is not included in the original code.

    ### Code Details

    The code is written in Python and uses the following libraries:

    - `os`: for file operations
    - `numpy`: for numerical computations
    - `matplotlib.pyplot`: for plotting
    - `tqdm`: for progress bar
    - `pickle`: for serialization
    - `pandas`: for data manipulation

    The notebook is designed to be interactive, so you can run it in a Jupyter notebook environment.
