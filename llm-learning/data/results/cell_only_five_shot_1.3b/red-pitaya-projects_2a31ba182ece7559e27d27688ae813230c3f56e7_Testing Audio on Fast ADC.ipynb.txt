    ## Audio Test

    This notebook demonstrates the use of the FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) to generate audio. The FPGAs are used to create a simple audio signal generator. The audio signal is generated using a low-pass filter and then played back using the `IPython.display.Audio` function.

    ### Code Explanation

    The first part of the code is importing the necessary libraries. The `osc` function from the `fpga` library is used to create an oscillator. The `decimation` property is set to 45000, which reduces the data rate of the oscillator. The `trigger_pre` and `trigger_post` properties are set to 0, which means the trigger is set at the start and end of the buffer. The `trig_src` property is set to 0, which means the trigger source is the module itself. The `reset`, `start`, `trigger`, and `status_run` methods are used to start, trigger, and wait for the data. The `data` method is used to get the data from the buffer, and the `IPython.display.Audio` function is used to play the audio signal.

    ### Results

    The audio signal is generated using a low-pass filter, and the `IPython.display.Audio` function is used to play the signal. The audio signal is displayed using a Matplotlib plot.

    ### Conclusion

    This notebook demonstrates the use of FPGAs to generate audio. The FPGAs are used to create a simple audio signal generator, and the `IPython.display.Audio` function is used to play the signal.
