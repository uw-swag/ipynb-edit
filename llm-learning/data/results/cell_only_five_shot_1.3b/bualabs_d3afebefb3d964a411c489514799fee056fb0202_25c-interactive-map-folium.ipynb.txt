The error message "Found bug folium cannot handle more than 3000 circles." is due to the fact that folium's Circle object can only handle a maximum of 3000 circles. This limit is imposed by the underlying leaflet.js library. 

To resolve this issue, you can create a GeoDataFrame from the earthquakes data and then use the `add_to` method of the GeoDataFrame to add the circles to the map. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from geopandas.tools import geocode

# Geocode the earthquakes
earthquakes['Location'] = earthquakes['Location'].apply(geocode)

# Create a GeoDataFrame from the earthquakes
gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(earthquakes, geometry='Location')

# Add the circles to the map
for idx, e in gdf.iterrows():    
    Circle(location=[e['Latitude'], e['Longitude']], radius=5000, color=e['marker_color']).add_to(m_2)

m_2
```

This code will create a GeoDataFrame from the earthquakes data, geocode the locations, and then add the circles to the map.
