The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook that uses the Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Plotly libraries to perform data analysis and visualization. It also uses the `evidently` library to create a dashboard for data drift analysis.

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. It imports necessary libraries and loads a Boston housing dataset.
2. It defines a `ColumnMapping` object, which maps the columns in the dataset to the target and prediction columns.
3. It sets up a `DataDriftOptions` object, which specifies the parameters for detecting dataset drift.
4. It creates a `Dashboard` object, which is used to visualize the data drift analysis.
5. It calculates the data drift and visualizes it using the `Dashboard` object.
6. It creates a `Profile` object, which is used to analyze the data drift.
7. It calculates the data drift and visualizes it using the `Profile` object.

The code is organized in a way that makes it easy to understand and maintain. The data is loaded and processed in a single cell, and the results are displayed in a separate cell. The code is also commented to make it easier to understand.

As for the GitBook documentation, it seems like the documentation for this code is not provided. If you have a specific question or need help with something, please provide more details.
