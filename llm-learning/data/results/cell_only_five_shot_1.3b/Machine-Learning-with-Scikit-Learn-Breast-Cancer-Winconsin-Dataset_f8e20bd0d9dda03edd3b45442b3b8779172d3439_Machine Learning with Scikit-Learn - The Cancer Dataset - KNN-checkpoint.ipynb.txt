```python
    from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

    # Create KNN classifier
    knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)

    # Fit the classifier to the data
    knn.fit(Xtrain, ytrain)

    # Predict the labels of the test set
    yfit = knn.predict(Xtest)

    # Print the accuracy
    print(np.mean(yfit == ytest))
    ```
    This code will print the accuracy of the KNN classifier on the test set.
