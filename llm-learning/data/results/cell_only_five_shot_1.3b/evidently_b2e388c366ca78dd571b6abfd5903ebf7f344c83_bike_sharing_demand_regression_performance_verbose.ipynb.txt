```python
    import dash
    import dash_core_components as dcc
    import dash_html_components as html

    app = dash.Dash(__name__)

    app.layout = html.Div([
        dcc.TabPanel(label='Tab 1', children=[
            html.Div('This is Tab 1 content.')
        ]),
        dcc.TabPanel(label='Tab 2', children=[
            html.Div('This is Tab 2 content.')
        ]),
        dcc.TabPanel(label='Tab 3', children=[
            html.Div('This is Tab 3 content.')
        ])
    ])

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run_server(debug=True, port=8050)
    ```

    ### Explanation:
    The code above is a simple example of using Dash with tabs. The `verbose_level` parameter is used to set the level of verbosity for the Dashboard. The `include_widgets` parameter is used to include widgets in the Dashboard.

    The `verbose_level` parameter can be set to a number from 0 to 4, where:

    0: No output.
    1: Warnings and errors.
    2: Info, warnings, and errors.
    3: Debug, info, warnings, and errors.
    4: Debug, info, warnings, errors, and tracebacks.

    The `include_widgets` parameter is a boolean that determines whether to include widgets in the Dashboard.

    In this example, the `verbose_level` is set to 2, which means that the Dashboard will display warnings and errors. The `include_widgets` is set to True, which means that the Dashboard will include widgets in the tabs.

    Please note that the `verbose_level` and `include_widgets` parameters are optional and can be set to their default values (0 and False, respectively) if not specified.
