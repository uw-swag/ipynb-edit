    ## Introduction

    This notebook provides an introduction to the topic of gradient descent optimization algorithms, particularly the methods of batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and mini-batch gradient descent. The focus is on the implementation of these methods in Python using the scikit-learn library.

    ## Code Explanation

    The code provided in the notebook is a demonstration of how to implement these methods in Python. The code is divided into two main sections: the first section is for the data visualization and the second section is for the actual implementation of the methods.

    ## Results

    The results of the code are the convergence of the gradient descent algorithms to the optimal solution of the normal equation. The code also demonstrates the use of the mini-batch gradient descent method, which is a variant of the batch gradient descent method that uses a subset of the data at each iteration.

    ## Conclusion

    The conclusion of this notebook is that gradient descent optimization algorithms are powerful tools for solving optimization problems. The methods of batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and mini-batch gradient descent are all widely used in machine learning and data science.
