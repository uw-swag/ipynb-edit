The code provided is a simple comparison of different models in the iris dataset. The `SimpleModelComparison` check is used to compare the performance of different models. The models compared are 'random', 'constant', and 'tree' with a condition that the gain in feature importance (measured by the `add_condition_gain_not_less_than` method) should be greater than 0.2.

The `run` method of the `SimpleModelComparison` check is used to execute the comparison. The `run` method takes three arguments: the training dataset, the test dataset, and the model to compare.

The `SimpleModelComparison` check returns a DataFrame with the comparison results. The DataFrame can be used to analyze the performance of the different models.

The comparison results can be used to select the best model for the given dataset and task.
