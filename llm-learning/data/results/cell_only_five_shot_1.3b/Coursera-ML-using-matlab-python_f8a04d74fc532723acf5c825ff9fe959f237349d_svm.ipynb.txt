    ### Response:
    It seems like you're trying to upload files to your Jupyter notebook. However, you didn't provide any code or any specific instructions. 

    If you're trying to upload a file, you can do it by using the `files` function in the `ipywidgets` library. Here's an example:

    ```python
    from IPython.display import files

    files.upload()
    ```

    This will open a dialog box where you can select the files you want to upload.

    If you're trying to add files to your notebook, you can do it by using the `%%bash` magic command. Here's an example:

    ```python
    %%bash
    touch test.txt
    ```

    This will create a new file named `test.txt` in the current directory.

    Please provide more specific instructions if you need help with these or any other code changes.
