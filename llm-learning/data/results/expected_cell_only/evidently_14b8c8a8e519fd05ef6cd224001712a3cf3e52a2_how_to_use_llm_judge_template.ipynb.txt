    ["Why do we have seasons?",
     "We have seasons because the Earth is tilted on its axis, which causes different parts of the Earth to receive more or less sunlight throughout the year.",
     "Seasons occur because of the tilt of the Earth’s axis, leading to varying amounts of sunlight reaching different areas as the Earth orbits the sun."],

    ["How do magnets work?",
     "Magnets work because they have a magnetic field that can attract or repel certain metals, like iron, due to the alignment of their atomic particles.",
     "Magnets generate a magnetic field, which can attract metals like iron by causing the electrons in those metals to align in a particular way, creating an attractive or repulsive force."],

    ["Why does the moon change shape?",
     "The moon changes shape, or goes through phases, because we see different portions of its illuminated half as it orbits the Earth.",
     "The moon appears to change shape as it orbits Earth, which is because we see different parts of its lit-up half at different times. The sun lights up half of the moon, but as the moon moves around the Earth, we see varying portions of that lit-up side. So, the moon's shape in the sky seems to change gradually, from a thin crescent to a full circle and back to a crescent again."]
