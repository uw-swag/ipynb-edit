    The commit message "bump of D2L Java book version to 0.8.0 (#58)" is a request to bump the version of the D2L Java book to 0.8.0. This is a major version upgrade, which could potentially include changes to the book's content, structure, or functionality.

    The original code cells are not provided, but I can provide a brief explanation of what they do.

    - `<Cell_0>` and `<Cell_1>`: These cells are setting up the Maven repository and importing necessary Java libraries.

    - `<Cell_2>`: This cell is loading a Java file from the utils directory.

    - `<Cell_3>`: This cell is defining the batch size and whether to shuffle the training data.

    - `<Cell_4>`: This cell is defining a custom activation function for the softmax function.

    - `<Cell_5>`: This cell is creating a new instance of the Model class.

    - `<Cell_6>`: This cell is defining the loss function for the model.

    - `<Cell_7>`: This cell is setting up a learning rate tracker and optimizer.

    - `<Cell_8>`: This cell is setting up the training configuration with the loss function, model accuracy, and logging.

    - `<Cell_9>`: This cell is initializing the model with the training configuration.

    - `<Cell_10>`: This cell is setting up the metrics for the model.

    - `<Cell_11>`: This cell is defining the number of epochs for the training.

    - `<Cell_12>`: This cell is training the model with the training data and validation data.

    Please note that the actual changes to the code will depend on the specifics of the D2L Java book and the changes requested in the commit message.
