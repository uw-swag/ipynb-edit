    The code you've provided seems to be a part of a Jupyter notebook, and it's using the Deep Java Library (DJL) to perform some operations on GPUs. However, the code you've provided is not complete and does not seem to be a bug. 

    The code is supposed to run a function `run` on an input `NDArray`, and then measure the time it takes to run this function on CPU and GPU devices. The code also includes a function `copyToCPU` to copy the result of the GPU operation to the CPU.

    However, the code you've provided is incomplete and does not seem to be a bug. It's also not clear what the purpose of the code is. 

    If you're seeing a significant performance difference between the CPU and GPU devices, it might be due to a bug in the code. If you're not seeing a significant performance difference, it might be due to other factors.

    Please provide more information or a complete code snippet to help me identify the problem.
