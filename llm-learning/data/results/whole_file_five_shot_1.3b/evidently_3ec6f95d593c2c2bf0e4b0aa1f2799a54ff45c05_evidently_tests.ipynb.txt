    The code you've provided is a collection of examples for data quality and regression tests. Here's a brief explanation of what each section does:

    1. `<Cell_0>`: This cell imports the necessary libraries.

    2. `<Cell_1>`: This cell imports the MNIST dataset and normalizes the data.

    3. `<Cell_2>`: This cell imports the adult dataset, removes some instances with education levels that are not 'Some-college', 'HS-grad', or 'Bachelors'.

    The rest of the cells perform different types of tests on the adult dataset. For example, they test the number of columns, rows, missing values, and columns with missing values, and so on.

    The tests are run on the reference and current datasets, and the results are printed out.

    Please note that the code you've provided is a part of a larger codebase and it's not clear what the purpose of each section is.
    It's also worth noting that the code you've provided is a collection of examples and not a complete solution.
    The actual implementation of these tests would depend on the specific requirements of your project.
    For example, the tests for regression would need to be adjusted based on the actual data and the type of regression model you're using.
    Similarly, the tests for classification would need to be adjusted based on the actual data and the type of classification model you're using.
    The code you've provided is a starting point and you would need to adjust it to fit your specific needs.
