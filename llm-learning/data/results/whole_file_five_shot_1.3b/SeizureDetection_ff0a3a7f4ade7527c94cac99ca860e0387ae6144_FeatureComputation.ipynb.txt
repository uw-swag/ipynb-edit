    The code you provided is a set of functions for feature extraction from EEG data. These functions are designed to extract various features from the EEG data such as time domain features, frequency domain features, and correlation features.

    The functions are:

    1. `leftRightHemisphericChannels`: This function is used to separate the left and right hemisphere channels of the EEG data.

    2. `averageChannels`: This function is used to compute the average of the left and right channels.

    3. `computeTimeDomainFeatures`: This function is used to compute various time domain features such as mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, standard deviation, median, zero cross rate, coefficient of variation, root mean square, peak to peak, and sample entropy of the EEG signal.

    4. `psd`: This function is used to compute the power spectral density of the EEG signal.

    5. `computeCorrelation`: This function is used to compute the correlation between two EEG signals.

    6. `featureExtractionLeftRight`: This function is used to extract features from the left and right hemisphere channels of the EEG data.

    7. `featureExtractionAverage`: This function is used to extract features from the average of the left and right channels of the EEG data.

    8. `featureExtractionFull`: This function is used to extract features from the full EEG data.

    These functions are designed to be used in a pipeline where the EEG data is preprocessed and passed to these functions for feature extraction.

    Please note that the functions are not directly executable. They are meant to be used in a pipeline where the EEG data is preprocessed and passed to these functions for feature extraction.
