    This code is written in Java and uses the Deep Java Library (DJL) for deep learning. DJL is a machine learning library for the JVM that provides a high-level, user-friendly interface for building and training machine learning models.

    Here's a brief overview of the code:

    1. The code imports necessary libraries for image processing, deep learning, and the bounding box detection.

    2. The code loads an image from a URL.

    3. The code defines a function to convert the bounding box coordinates into a rectangle format.

    4. The code creates a list of class names and a list of probabilities for each class. It also creates a list of bounding boxes.

    5. The code detects objects in the image using the bounding boxes and class names.

    6. The code draws the detected objects on the original image.

    This is a simple example of object detection using the DJL library. The code uses a pre-trained model from the DJL model zoo to detect objects in an image. The model is trained to recognize dogs and cats.

    Please note that this code is a simplified example and may not work as expected in a real-world scenario.

    The code also uses the MXNet engine, which is a deep learning framework for Apache MXNet. MXNet is a powerful open-source platform for deep learning and artificial intelligence.

    The code also uses the MXNet native auto layer, which is a layer that provides a high-performance implementation of the MXNet engine.

    The code also uses the Apache SLF4J logging library, which is a simple API for logging events.

    The code also uses the Apache Maven build automation tool, which is a tool for managing and automating the process of building, testing, and deploying software applications.

    The code also uses the Deep Java Library (DJL), which is a machine learning library for the JVM. DJL provides a high-level, user-friendly interface for building and training machine learning models.

    The code also uses the Maven repository, which is a repository manager for Maven projects.

    The code also uses the Maven SNAPSHOT repository, which is a repository manager for Maven projects.

    The code also uses
