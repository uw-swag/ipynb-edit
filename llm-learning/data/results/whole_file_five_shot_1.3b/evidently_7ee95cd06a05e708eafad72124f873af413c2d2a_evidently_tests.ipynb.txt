The code cells you provided are used to perform various data analysis tasks, such as fetching datasets, cleaning data, performing data quality and integrity tests, and performing regression and classification performance tests.

The color options are used to customize the color scheme of the plots generated by the tests.

The tests are run on datasets of different types (numerical, categorical, binary, regression, classification, and probabilistic classification) and different levels (dataset and column).

The tests are run with different parameters and options, such as the number of sigmas for the test of Mean in NSigmas, the threshold for out-of-range values, the missing values percentage for a column, and the color scheme.
