The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook and it's using a number of libraries and utilities to train a model. However, the code you provided is not complete and does not include the complete code for the model training. 

The complete code for the model training would depend on the specifics of the model, the dataset, and the training parameters. 

The code you provided is loading the necessary libraries and utilities, preparing the dataset, defining the model, and then training the model. 

However, without the complete code, it's hard to provide a specific solution. If you need help with a specific part of the code, please provide the code and I'll be happy to help.
