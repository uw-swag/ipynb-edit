    ### Response:
    The code provided is not a valid code cell. It seems like you're trying to display a list of URLs, but the code provided is not a valid code cell. 

    If you want to display a list of URLs, you can use the following code:

    ```python
    links = ["https://www.bualfabs.com/", "https://www.bualfabs.com/", "https://www.bualfabs.com/", "https://www.bualfabs.com/", "https://www.bualfabs.com/"]

    for link in links:
        display(HTML(value=link))
    ```

    This code will display a list of URLs in a Jupyter notebook.
