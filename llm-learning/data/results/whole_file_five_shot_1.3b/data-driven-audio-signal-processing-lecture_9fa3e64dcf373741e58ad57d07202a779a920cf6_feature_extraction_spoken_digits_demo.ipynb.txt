    The path for the binder service is '../data/free-spoken-digit-dataset/recordings/'. This path is used to load the audio files from the dataset. The audio files are loaded using the soundfile library and the maximum length of the examples is determined by the length of the longest audio file. The MFCC features are calculated for each audio file and then reshaped to fit the scikit-learn TruncatedSVD model. The scree plot is plotted to determine the number of components to keep. The scatter plot of the reduced feature vectors is also plotted. The correct classification of spoken digit 0 and digit 5 is calculated and printed.
