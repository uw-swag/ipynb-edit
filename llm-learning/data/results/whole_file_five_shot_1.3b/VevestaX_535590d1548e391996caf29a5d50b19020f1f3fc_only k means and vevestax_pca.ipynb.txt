    ## K-Means Clustering

    K-Means is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering. It works by partitioning the dataset into K distinct groups or clusters, where each group is a centroid (or center) of the data points.

    ## Installation

    You can install the K-Means clustering model from the Python package index using pip:

    ```
    pip install kmeans
    ```

    ## Usage

    Here is a simple example of how to use the K-Means clustering model:

    ```python
    from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

    # Assuming X is your data
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=0).fit(X)

    # Get the cluster labels
    labels = kmeans.labels_

    # Get the cluster centers
    centers = kmeans.cluster_centers_
    ```

    ## Model

    The K-Means model is a simple and efficient algorithm for clustering. It works by partitioning the data into K distinct groups or clusters, and then re-assigning each data point to the cluster with the nearest mean.

    The K-Means algorithm has two main parts:

    1. Initialization: The algorithm randomly selects K data points as the initial centroids.
    2. Assignment: Each data point is assigned to the cluster whose centroid is closest.
    3. Update: The centroids of the K clusters are recalculated as the mean of the data points assigned to them.
