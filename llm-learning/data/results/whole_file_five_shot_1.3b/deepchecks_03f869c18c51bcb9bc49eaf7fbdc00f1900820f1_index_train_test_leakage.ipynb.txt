    The code provided is a simple example of using the DeepChecks library to perform an index train-test leakage check. The version bump is done by incrementing the version number in the commit message.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The `dataset_from_dict` function is used to create a `Dataset` object from a dictionary.
    - The `IndexTrainTestLeakage` check is used to check for index train-test leakage.
    - The `run` method of the `IndexTrainTestLeakage` check is used to perform the check on the two datasets.

    The version bump is done by incrementing the version number in the commit message.

    The code also includes a few examples of how to use the `IndexTrainTestLeakage` check with different parameters.

    The commit message "0.4.0 version bump ðŸš€" indicates that the version of the code has been incremented to 0.4.0.

    The commit hash "#766" is used to link the commit to a specific issue or PR in the repository.

    The commit message also includes a link to the DeepChecks documentation, which provides more information about the `IndexTrainTestLeakage` check.
