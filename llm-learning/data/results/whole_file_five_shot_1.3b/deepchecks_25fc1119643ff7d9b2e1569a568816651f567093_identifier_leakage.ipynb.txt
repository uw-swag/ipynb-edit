The code you provided is a modification of the Deepchecks library, which is used for data quality checks. The `IdentifierLeakage` check is a method used to detect when the same identifier is used for different columns. In the provided code, the `IdentifierLeakage` check is used to detect when the same identifier is used for different columns.

However, the code you provided is not complete and does not provide a complete solution. The `IdentifierLeakage` check is not a built-in function in Deepchecks, so you need to install it first.

Here is a complete example of how to use the `IdentifierLeakage` check:

```python
from deepchecks.checks.methodology import IdentifierLeakage

# Assuming df is your DataFrame
my_check = IdentifierLeakage(ppscore_params={'sample': 10})
my_check.run(dataset=dataset)
```

This will return a DataFrame with the identifiers that are not unique and their corresponding values.
