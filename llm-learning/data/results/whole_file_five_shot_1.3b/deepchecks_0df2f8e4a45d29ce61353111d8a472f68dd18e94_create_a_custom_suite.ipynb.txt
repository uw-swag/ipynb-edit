    The performance report degradation fix (#444) has been implemented in the code. The fix involves the use of custom scorers for the performance report, which allows for a more detailed analysis of the model's performance. The scorers are used to calculate the performance metrics such as precision, recall, and the ratio of unused features. The conditions for the performance report are set to ensure that the model's performance is not degraded below a certain threshold.

    The performance report is run on the model after the data is split into training and testing sets. The suite of checks is then modified to include a new check for unused features and a condition for the SingleFeatureContributionTrainTest check. The suite is then updated with these changes and run again to see the effect of the changes.
