    The code you provided is a demonstration of how to create a custom suite of checks for model performance in DeepChecks. The suite includes checks for model information, performance report, confusion matrix report, and simple model comparison. The suite is then run on a random forest classifier on the iris dataset.

    The suite is modified by removing a check and adding a new one, and the conditions for the SingleFeatureContributionTrainTest check are updated. The modified suite is then run again.

    Please note that the code provided is a simplified example and may not cover all possible scenarios. For a more comprehensive demonstration, you may need to adjust the code to fit your specific use case.

    Also, please note that the code provided is written in Python and uses the DeepChecks library, which is a Python library for automated machine learning.
