    ## Introduction to Matplotlib and Line Plots

    Matplotlib is a plotting library in Python. It provides a high-level interface for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, GTK, GTK+, Fltk, and others.

    Line plots are a type of plot that displays a series of data points as if they were connected in a line. They are used to show trends, changes, or patterns over time.

    In this notebook, we will learn how to:

    1. Import necessary libraries.
    2. Read an Excel file using pandas.
    3. Drop unnecessary columns from the dataframe.
    4. Rename columns.
    5. Create a new column 'Total' that calculates the cumulative immigration for each country.
    6. Filter the dataframe to get the top 5 countries with the highest immigration.
    7. Plot the immigration trends for the top 5 countries.

    This will help you understand how to use Matplotlib to create line plots.

    Remember, the key to good data visualization is to understand the data and the question you are trying to answer.

    Let's start by importing the necessary libraries.

    ## Code

    import numpy as np  # useful for many scientific computing in Python
    import pandas as pd # primary data structure library

    ## Code

    #install the openpyxl package
