    out_dir = '/scratch/users/vision/yu_dl/raaz.rsk/test/5_5_test' # directory containing model pkls
    fnames = sorted([oj(out_dir, fname) for fname in os.listdir(out_dir)]) # filenames in the directory
    results_list = [pd.Series(pkl.load(open(fname, "rb"))) for fname in tqdm(fnames) 
                    if not 'weights' in fname and not 'idx' in fname]

    print(results.shape)
    ```

    The code above is a comparison of the versions of the same notebook. It loads the results from the specified directory, which contains the pickle files of the different runs of the notebook. The results are then stored in a pandas DataFrame, and the shape of the DataFrame is printed.

    Please note that the code assumes that the pickle files contain the results of the same run of the notebook. If the results are different, the code will not work as expected.
