    The code you provided is a PyTorch implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The code includes importing necessary libraries, defining a custom dataset class, defining a CNN model, defining a callback class for training and validation, and finally training the model.

    The code also includes a description and conclusion section. The description section explains the purpose of the code, the conclusion section summarizes the results of the model.

    The code also includes a section for parameter scheduling, learning rate annealing, and a callback for recording training and validation statistics.

    The code also includes a section for plotting the learning rate and loss curves.

    The code also includes a section for running the model and displaying the results.

    The code is well-structured and follows the best practices for PyTorch development.
