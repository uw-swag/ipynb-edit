    # This is a continuation of the code for the RNN part of the assignment.
    # It includes the creation of the RNN model, training it, and making predictions.
    # The model is a simple LSTM model with a softmax at the end, which is used for character prediction.
    # The training is done using the Adam optimizer, which is a popular choice for RNNs.
    # The loss function is the mean cross entropy loss, which is used to measure the quality of the predictions.
    # The predictions are made by running the model on the test data and printing the characters that the model predicts.
    # The model is trained for 500 iterations, printing the loss every 500 iterations.
    # The model's predictions are then printed to the console.

    The code is designed to be run in a Jupyter notebook environment. It first checks the Python version and if it's less than 3.4, it prints a warning and instructions on how to install the necessary libraries.
    The code then imports the necessary libraries and sets up the environment for the notebook.
    The code then defines the input pipeline for the RNN model, creates a session, and starts the training loop.
    The model is trained for 10 epochs, printing the loss every 500 iterations.
    The model's predictions are made on the test data and printed to the console.
    The code ends with the model's predictions being printed to the console.
