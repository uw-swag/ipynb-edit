```python
    def two_step(step1, step2, step3):
        # Step 1: 1-DNF
        # This is a placeholder for the first step in the two-step process.
        # The function should implement a 1-DNF (Disjunctive Normal Form) algorithm.
        # The input to this function is a 1-DNF formula.
        # The function should return a boolean indicating whether the formula is valid.
        #
        # Step 2: iterableSVM
        # This is a placeholder for the second step in the two-step process.
        # The function should implement an iterable Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.
        # The input to this function is an iterable of data points.
        # The function should return a prediction for each data point.
        #
        # Step 3: F1'
        # This is a placeholder for the third step in the two-step process.
        # The function should implement a F1' (F1 with a prime) score.
        # The input to this function is two predictions.
        # The function should return a F1' score.
        pass
