    The code you provided is a complete script for training a convolutional neural network on the MNIST dataset using PyTorch. It includes importing necessary libraries, defining a custom dataset class, downloading the MNIST dataset, normalizing the data, defining the CNN model, and more.

    The script also includes callbacks for training and validation, including recorder for plotting training and validation loss, and a callback for learning rate scheduling.

    The script also includes code for training the model on the GPU if available, and a custom callback for transferring the model to the GPU.

    The script also includes a function for combining different learning rate schedules, and a function for annealing a learning rate.
