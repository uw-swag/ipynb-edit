    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

    # Load the data
    df = pd.read_csv('ml-diary.csv')

    # Preprocess the data
    # This step depends on the specifics of your data
    # For example, you might need to handle missing values, normalize/standardize data, etc.

    # Split the data into features and target
    X = df.drop('target', axis=1)
    y = df['target']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Create a Linear Regression model
    model = LinearRegression()

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
    print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')

    # Save the model
    # This step depends on the specifics of your project and what you want to save the model as
    # For example, you might want to save the model to a file, or use a library like joblib to save the model to disk

    # Load the model
    # This step depends on the specifics of your project and what you want to load the model from
    # For example, you might want to load the model from a file, or use a library like joblib to load the model from disk

    # Try Jupyter style
    # This step depends on the specifics of your project and what you want to try with Jupyter
    # For example, you might want to use Jupyter notebooks to visualize your data, or to create interactive plots
