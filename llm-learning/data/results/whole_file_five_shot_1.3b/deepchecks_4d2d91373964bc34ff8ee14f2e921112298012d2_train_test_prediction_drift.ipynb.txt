    The code you provided is a mix of Python and Sphinx markup. Sphinx is a tool for generating documentation from source code, and it uses a markup language called reStructuredText. The code you provided is written in Python and uses the Deepchecks library, which is a Python library for data-centric AI.

    The code is divided into several cells, each cell is a block of code that can be executed independently. The code is divided into several sections, each section is a block of code that is related to a specific task.

    The first section is importing necessary libraries and modules.

    The next section is importing the dataset and loading the model.

    The next section is creating a DataLoader for the training and testing datasets.

    The next section is creating a DataLoader for the modified training and testing datasets.

    The next section is running the TrainTestPredictionDrift check on the training and testing datasets.

    The next section is running the TrainTestPredictionDrift check on the modified training and testing datasets.

    The next section is running the ClassPerformance check on the training and testing datasets.

    The next section is running the ClassPerformance check on the modified training and testing datasets.

    The next section is importing the dataset and loading the model.
