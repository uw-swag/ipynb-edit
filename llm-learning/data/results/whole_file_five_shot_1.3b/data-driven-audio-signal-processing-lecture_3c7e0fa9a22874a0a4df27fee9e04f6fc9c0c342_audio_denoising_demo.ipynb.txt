    The code is for a demonstration of audio denoising using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The code is divided into several cells for better readability and understanding.

    The first cell imports necessary libraries and modules.

    The next cell defines a function to generate features for the CNN model.

    The next cell defines the CNN model and compiles it.

    The next cell trains the model and saves the denoised audio.

    The next cell plots the training and validation loss.

    The last cell is the main function that calls all the previous cells.
