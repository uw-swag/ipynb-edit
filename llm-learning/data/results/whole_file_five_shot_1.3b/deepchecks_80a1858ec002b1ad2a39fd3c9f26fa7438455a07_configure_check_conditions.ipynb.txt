    The code you've provided is a collection of Jupyter notebook cells that demonstrate the use of different deepchecks features. Here's a brief explanation of what each cell does:

1. `<Cell_0>`-`<Cell_1>`: These cells demonstrate the use of the `DatasetsSizeComparison` check in deepchecks. The `DatasetsSizeComparison` check is used to compare the size of the training and test datasets.

2. `<Cell_2>`-`<Cell_3>`: These cells demonstrate the use of the `overfit_suite` function in deepchecks. The `overfit_suite` function is used to create a suite of checks that are designed to detect overfitting.

3. `<Cell_4>`-`<Cell_5>`: These cells demonstrate the use of the `custom_condition` function in deepchecks. The `custom_condition` function is a custom condition that checks if the test-train ratio is between a certain threshold.

4. `<Cell_6>`-`<Cell_7>`: These cells demonstrate the use of the `custom_condition` function in deepchecks. The `custom_condition` function is used to create a custom condition for the `DatasetsSizeComparison` check.

5. `<Cell_8>`-`<Cell_9>`: These cells demonstrate the use of the `Suite` class in deepchecks. The `Suite` class is used to run a suite of checks and conditions.

6. `<Cell_10>`-`<Cell_11>`: These cells demonstrate the use of the `ConditionResult` and `ConditionCategory` classes in deepchecks. The `ConditionResult` class is used to represent the result of a condition, and the `ConditionCategory` class is used to categorize the result.

7. `<Cell_12>`-`<Cell_13>`: These cells demonstrate the use of the `custom_condition` function in deepchecks. The `custom_condition` function is used to create a custom condition for the `DatasetsSizeComparison` check.

8. `<Cell_14>`-`<Cell_15>`: These cells demonstrate the use of the `Suite` class in deepchecks
