    The commit message "Upgrade to djl 0.13.0 (#176)" indicates a change in the version of the Deep Java Library (djl). The djl is a machine learning library for Java that provides a high-level API for building and training machine learning models. The change is related to the 0.13.0 version of the djl.

    The code cells in the commit message are related to the upgrade of the djl library. The first cell loads the necessary imports and utilities for the djl library. The next cell creates a new instance of the NDManager class, which is used to manage the creation and management of NDArrays. The next cell defines a function, maskedSoftmax, which performs a softmax operation on an NDArray, but only on the last axis of the array. The next cell uses the NDManager to create random data and perform a softmax operation on it. The next cell defines a new class, AdditiveAttention, which implements an additive attention mechanism. The next cell uses the NDManager to create data and perform an additive attention operation on it. The next cell uses the PlotUtils class to display the attention weights. The next cell uses the NDManager to create data and perform a dot product attention operation on it. The next cell uses the PlotUtils class to display the attention weights.

    The commit message also mentions a new class, DotProductAttention, which implements a scaled dot product attention mechanism. The commit message also mentions the use of the NDManager to create data and perform an attention operation on it.

    The commit message is a good example of how to use the djl library's features to build and train machine learning models.
