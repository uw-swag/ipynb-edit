    The code provided is a set of functions for oversampling and undersampling techniques using imbalanced-learn library in Python. The functions are:

    1. oversamplingSMOTE: This function applies the SMOTE oversampling technique to the given feature set.
    2. oversamplingADASYN: This function applies the ADASYN oversampling technique to the given feature set.
    3. minorityOversampling: This function decides which oversampling technique to use based on the input parameter.
    4. undersamplingClusterCentroids: This function applies the ClusterCentroids undersampling technique to the given feature set.
    5. undersamplingNearMiss: This function applies the NearMiss undersampling technique to the given feature set.
    6. undersamplingRandom: This function applies the RandomUnderSampler undersampling technique to the given feature set.
    7. majorityUndersampling: This function decides which undersampling technique to use based on the input parameter.

    These functions are used in the main script or notebook where the feature set is loaded and the seizure label is to be predicted.
