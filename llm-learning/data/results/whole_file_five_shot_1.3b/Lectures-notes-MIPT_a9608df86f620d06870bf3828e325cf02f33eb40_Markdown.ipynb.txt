    ## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

    Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications. The main idea of OOP is to "composition" through the use of "classes".

    ### Classes and Objects

    A class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

    An object is an instance of a class. It contains both data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

    ### Inheritance

    Inheritance is a mechanism that allows you to create a new class from an existing class, where the new class is a combination of the existing class's fields and methods.

    ### Polymorphism

    Polymorphism is a concept that allows methods to be used in the same way whether they are related to each other or not.

    ### Encapsulation

    Encapsulation is the process of wrapping the data and the code that manipulates the data into a single unit called a class.

    ### Abstraction

    Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the user.

    ### SOLID Principles

    SOLID is an acronym for five principles that help developers design maintainable and scalable systems. These principles are:

    1. Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have only one reason to change.
    2. Open/Closed Principle: You should be able to extend a class's behavior, without modifying it.
    3. Liskov Substitution Principle: Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.
    4. Interface Segregation Principle: Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.
    5. Dependency Inversion Principle: Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.

    ### Design Patterns

    Design patterns are solutions to common problems that you can use in your code. They are not specific to any language, but
