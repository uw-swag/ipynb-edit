    This is a Jupyter notebook that uses the PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and AtomAI libraries to perform a variety of tasks.

    The notebook begins with installing the necessary libraries. It then downloads a dataset from a Dropbox link and loads it into a Python environment.

    The notebook then explores the loaded data, normalizes the data, and finds peaks in the spectra. It also demonstrates how to use the AtomAI library to perform a kind of "acquisition function" in a machine learning context.

    The notebook then performs a series of experiments on the acquired data, each of which involves updating the model, performing a "thompson sampling" decision, and measuring the result. The results are then plotted and discussed.

    Finally, the notebook demonstrates how to use the acquired data to train a model, and how to use the model's predictions to "measure" the unknown data.

    The notebook ends with a final plot of the acquired data, and a series of plots showing the model's predictions and the known data.

    The notebook is designed to be a hands-on exercise, and it's intended to be a practical introduction to the use of the AtomAI library in machine learning.

    The notebook is written in a markdown-like language, and it's designed to be readable and understandable by a wide range of users, including those without a background in machine learning or data science.

    The notebook is also designed to be interactive, and it allows users to explore the results of the experiments in real-time.

    The notebook is also designed to be extensible, and it allows users to add or modify the experiments and the plots to customize the results to their specific needs.

    The notebook is also designed to be reproducible, and it includes a code cell for each of the experiments and the plots, making it easy for users to recreate the results of the experiments.

    The notebook is also designed to be shareable, and it includes a shareable link to the notebook, which can be shared with others to collaborate on the experiments.

    The notebook is also designed to be collaborative, and it allows users to share the results of the experiments with others, and it allows users to collaborate on the plots and the
