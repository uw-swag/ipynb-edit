    The code you provided is a part of a larger system that involves the use of a labeling mechanism to change the distribution of data. The labeling mechanism is a method used to adjust the propensity scores of the data points, which are used to make predictions. The propensity score is a measure of a person's likelihood of having a certain attribute, based on their past behavior.

    The code is divided into several cells, each of which is responsible for a specific task. Here's a brief overview of what each cell does:

    1. `get_samples(n: int)`: This function generates `n` samples of data. The data is generated by randomly selecting whether to draw from a multivariate normal distribution with a certain mean and covariance or another.

    2. `from data import N_TRAIN, N_VALID, N_TEST`: This line imports the number of training, validation, and test samples.

    3. `plot_x_y(train_xs, train_ys)`: This function plots the data points.

    4. `c = 0.2`: This line sets the label frequency.

    5. `propensity_score(ys)`: This function calculates the propensity score for a given set of labels.

    6. `get_label(y, e)`: This function gets the label for a given data point and propensity score.

    7. `train_ss = [get_label(y, e) for y, e in zip(train_ys, train_es)]`: This line generates the training set samples with the new labels.

    8. `plot_x_s(train_xs, train_ss)`: This function plots the data points with the new labels.

    9. `save_data(filename, xs, ys, ss, es)`: This function saves the data to a file.

    10. `save_c(filename, c)`: This function saves the label frequency to a file.

    11. `LabelingMechanism`: This class represents the labeling mechanism.

    12. `lm = LabelingMechanism([0],[1], min_prob=0, max_prob=1)`: This
