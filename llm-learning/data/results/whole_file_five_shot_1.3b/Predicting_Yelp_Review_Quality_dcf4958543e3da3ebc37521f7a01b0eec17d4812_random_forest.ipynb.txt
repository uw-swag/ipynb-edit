    The code you've provided is a mix of Python and Jupyter notebook code. It's using a variety of libraries and packages to perform various tasks, including data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

    Here's a brief overview of what each section of code does:

    1. `<Cell_0>`-`<Cell_1>`: This section imports the necessary libraries and sets some options for the pandas DataFrame and matplotlib plotting.

    2. `<Cell_2>`: This section connects to a PostgreSQL database and reads the first 100000 rows of data from a table named 'model_data_cls_train'.

    3. `<Cell_3>`: This section drops duplicate rows from the DataFrame.

    4. `<Cell_4>`: This section prints the shape of the DataFrame and counts the number of 'TARGET_review_has_upvotes' rows.

    5. `<Cell_5>`: This section drops the 'level_0', 'index', 'review_id', 'restaurant_latitude', 'restaurant_longitude', and 'TARGET_review_has_upvotes' columns from the DataFrame.

    6. `<Cell_6>`: This section prints the shape of the DataFrame, counts the number of 'quality' and 'not_quality' rows, and calculates the percentages of 'quality' rows.

    7. `<Cell_7>`: This section splits the DataFrame into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% for testing.

    8. `<Cell_8>`: This section creates a RandomForestClassifier model with 100 trees, and fits the model to the training data.

    9. `<Cell_9>`: This section prints the out-of-bag score, the training accuracy score, the test accuracy score, the precision, recall, and F1 score of the model, and the confusion matrix.

    10. `<Cell_10>`-`<Cell_11>`: This section calculates permutation importances and feature importances, and plots them.
