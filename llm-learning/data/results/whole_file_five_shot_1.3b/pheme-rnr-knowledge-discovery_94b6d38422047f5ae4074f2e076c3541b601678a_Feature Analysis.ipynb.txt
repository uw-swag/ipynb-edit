```python
    # Import necessary libraries
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns

    # Load the data
    df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

    # Perform preliminary feature analysis
    # This will depend on the specific features in your data
    # For example, you might want to check the distribution of a feature,
    # check for missing values, or perform some basic statistical analysis

    # For example, you might want to check the distribution of a feature,
    # check for missing values, or perform some basic statistical analysis

    # For example, you might want to check the distribution of a feature,
    # check for missing values, or perform some basic statistical analysis

    # You can then visualize the results using matplotlib or seaborn
    plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
    sns.countplot(data=df, x='feature_name')
    plt.title('Distribution of Feature')
    plt.show()

    # You can also perform more complex statistical analysis,
    # such as calculating correlations or performing hypothesis tests

    # For example, you might want to calculate the correlation between two features
    correlation = df['feature1'].corr(df['feature2'])
    print('Correlation:', correlation)

    # You can also perform more complex statistical analysis,
    # such as calculating the mean or median of a feature,
    # or performing a hypothesis test

    # For example, you might want to calculate the mean of a feature
    mean = df['feature'].mean()
    print('Mean:', mean)

    # You can also perform more complex visualizations,
    # such as creating a histogram or boxplot

    plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
    sns.histplot(data=df, x='feature', bins=30)
    plt.title('Histogram of Feature')
    plt.show()
