The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook, and it's used to perform a data quality check on a dataset. The check is a part of the Deepchecks library, which is a Python library for data quality checks.

The check is used to ensure that the train and test datasets have the same number of samples. If the number of samples in the train dataset is different from the test dataset, the check will fail.

The `TrainTestSamplesMix` check is used to perform this data quality check. The `run` method of the `TrainTestSamplesMix` check is used to perform the check.

The `run` method takes two parameters: `test_dataset` and `train_dataset`. The `test_dataset` parameter is the dataset to be tested, and the `train_dataset` parameter is the dataset to be used as a reference.

The `run` method returns a report of the check, which includes the number of samples in the train and test datasets, the number of samples that failed the check, and the number of samples that passed the check.
