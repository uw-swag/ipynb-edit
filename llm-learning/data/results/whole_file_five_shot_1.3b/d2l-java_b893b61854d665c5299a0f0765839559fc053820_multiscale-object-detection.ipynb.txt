```
    The code you provided seems to be a part of a Jupyter notebook, and it seems to be using a custom function `displayAnchors` to display bounding boxes on an image. However, the code you provided is not complete and does not seem to be related to the `displayAnchors` function. Could you please provide more details or clarify what you want to achieve?
