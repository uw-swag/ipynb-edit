    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the AutoMLOps library to automate machine learning workflows. The notebook includes components for data creation, model training, and model deployment.

    The components are defined in separate Python files (`create_dataset.py`, `train_model.py`, and `deploy_model.py`) that are imported and used in the main pipeline (`pipeline.py`).

    The pipeline is defined in `pipeline.py` and is run using the `AutoMLOps.go()` function. This function calls the components in the pipeline and provides the necessary parameters for each component.

    The pipeline parameters are defined in `pipeline_params` dictionary in `pipeline.py`.

    The pipeline is run using the `AutoMLOps.go()` function. This function calls the pipeline and provides the necessary parameters for the pipeline.

    The pipeline includes the following steps:

    1. `create_dataset`: Loads data from BigQuery into a Pandas Dataframe and writes it to a CSV file in Google Cloud Storage.
    2. `train_model`: Trains a decision tree on the training data and saves the trained model to a file in Google Cloud Storage.
    3. `deploy_model`: Deploys the trained model to Google Cloud AI Platform.

    The pipeline is run using the Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP) framework, which is a flexible, scalable, and open-source platform for defining, executing, and managing machine learning workflows.

    The pipeline parameters are defined in `pipeline_params` dictionary in `pipeline.py`.
