    ## Error: No plots
    ## 
    ## The error message "No plots" is usually due to the fact that the code is trying to plot something, but no plotting function is being used.
    ## 
    ## To fix this, you need to import the plotting function (like matplotlib.pyplot or seaborn.pyplot) and use it to create your plots.
    ## 
    ## For example, if you want to create a histogram of a certain column, you would do:
    ## 
    ## train_DF['Age'].plot(kind = 'hist', figsize = (15,3), bins = 100, xlim = (0,50))
    ## 
    ## This will create a histogram of the 'Age' column in the DataFrame 'train_DF'.
    ## 
    ## The exact function to use will depend on the type of plot you want to create.
