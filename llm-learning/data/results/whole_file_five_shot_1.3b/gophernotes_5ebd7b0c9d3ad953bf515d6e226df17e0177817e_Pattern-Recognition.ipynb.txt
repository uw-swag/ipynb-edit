    The code provided is a simple example of how to use the golearn library in Go to perform a K-nearest neighbors classification on a dataset. The dataset is loaded from a CSV file, a new KNN classifier is created, a training-test split is performed, the classifier is trained, and the classifier is used to predict the labels of the test data. The precision, recall, and F1-score of the predictions are calculated and printed.
