    The TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a corpus. The importance increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus.

    The TF-IDF score is a measure of how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. It is a combination of the TF (Term Frequency) and IDF (Inverse Document Frequency).
