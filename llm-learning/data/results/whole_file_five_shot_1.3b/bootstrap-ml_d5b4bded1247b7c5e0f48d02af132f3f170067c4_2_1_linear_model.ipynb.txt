```python
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
    ```
    This code creates a linear regression model using the sklearn library. The model is trained on a portion of the data, and then it's used to predict the values of the test data. The mean squared error is then calculated to evaluate the model's performance.
