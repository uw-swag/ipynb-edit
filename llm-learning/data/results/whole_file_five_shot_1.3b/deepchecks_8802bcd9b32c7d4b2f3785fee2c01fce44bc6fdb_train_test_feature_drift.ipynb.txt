    The code you provided is a set of Jupyter notebooks that perform various operations on a dataset, including data cleaning, data transformation, model training, and feature drift checks. 

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The first part of the code imports necessary libraries and generates a random dataset.
    - The second part of the code shows the first few rows of the training data.
    - The third part of the code adds some randomness to the 'numeric_with_drift' column and modifies the 'categorical_with_drift' column.
    - The fourth part of the code creates a pipeline that handles categorical features and applies an ordinal encoder to numerical features.
    - The fifth part of the code trains a decision tree classifier on the training data and creates a dataset for testing.
    - The sixth part of the code runs a feature drift check on the training and testing datasets.
    - The seventh and eighth parts of the code add a condition to the feature drift check and run it.

    The notebooks are designed to be interactive and allow for easy navigation and understanding of the code.

    The last part of the code is a comment that explains the purpose of the code.

    Please note that the code is written in Python and uses several libraries such as numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, and deepchecks.
