    The section 2.5: Automatic Differentiation (#80) is a topic related to numerical computation and automatic differentiation. It involves the use of automatic differentiation to compute the derivative of a function. In the context of deep learning, automatic differentiation is used to compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of the neural network.

    The code provided is a high-level overview of how automatic differentiation can be used in a deep learning model. The code uses the Maven build system to download and load the necessary libraries, and then uses them to train a simple linear regression model. The model is saved to a file for later use.

    However, the actual implementation of automatic differentiation in this context would be quite complex and beyond the scope of this code snippet.
