    The code provided is a set of functions to perform oversampling on a dataset using SMOTE and ADASYN methods. These methods are used to balance the class imbalance in the dataset.

    The `oversamplingSMOTE` function uses SMOTE to oversample the minority class. SMOTE is a type of oversampling where the minority class is synthesized by creating an equal number of samples of the minority class.

    The `oversamplingADASYN` function uses ADASYN to oversample the minority class. ADASYN is a type of oversampling where the minority class is synthesized by creating a synthetic sample of the minority class.

    The `datasetBalancing` function is a wrapper function that calls the appropriate oversampling function based on the input parameter. It takes four parameters: the feature matrix `ft`, the index of the feature matrix `ft_index`, the number of neighbors to use in the oversampling method `neighbors`, and the oversampling method to use `method`.

    The function returns the oversampled feature matrix.

    Please note that the code provided is a simplified version of the code and may not work as expected. The code is based on the assumption that the 'seizure' column in the feature matrix is the target variable and that the other columns are the features.

    Also, please note that the code provided is a part of a larger project and it's not clear what the purpose of the code is. The code is used for oversampling the 'seizure' column in a dataset, but the actual purpose of the code may vary depending on the specific context of the project.
