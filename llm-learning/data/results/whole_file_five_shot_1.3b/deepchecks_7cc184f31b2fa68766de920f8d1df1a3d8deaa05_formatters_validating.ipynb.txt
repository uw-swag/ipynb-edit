    The code you provided is splitting the VisionData and removing formatters. The VisionData is a part of the DeepChecks library, which is used for data validation and visualization. The formatters are used to format the data for visualization.

    The code first imports the necessary libraries and loads the dataset. Then, it defines the formatters for the labels, images, and predictions. The `validate_formatters` function is used to validate the formatters.

    The code then defines a function to format the labels in the batch. The function translates the labels to the format required by the DetectionLabelFormatter.

    The code then defines a function to format the images in the batch. The function converts the images to a format that is compatible with the ImageFormatter.

    The code also defines a function to format the predictions in the batch. The function converts the predictions to a format that is compatible with the DetectionPredictionFormatter.

    Finally, the code validates the formatters by calling `validate_formatters` on the data loader, model, and the formatters.

    The code is split into multiple cells to make it easier to read and understand. Each cell contains a specific operation or function that is used to format the data.
