```python
    from deepchecks.vision.datasets.detection import coco

    yolo = coco.load_model(pretrained=True)
    train_ds = coco.load_dataset(object_type='VisionData')

    from deepchecks.vision.checks.performance import ConfusionMatrixReport

    check = ConfusionMatrixReport(categories_to_display=20)
    check.run(train_ds, yolo)
    ```

    The issue with the confusion matrix report is that it does not handle unseen classes correctly. The current implementation of the ConfusionMatrixReport class does not handle unseen classes. This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future version.
