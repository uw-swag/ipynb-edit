    This Jupyter Notebook is designed to work with a dataset of tweets from the German Wings crash. The dataset is loaded, preprocessed, and split into a training set and a test set. The preprocessing includes converting True/False values to 0/1, standardizing the columns, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

    The notebook then tests a variety of classifiers on the preprocessed data. The classifiers include Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests, AdaBoost, and Gaussian Processes. The results of each test are printed to the console.

    The notebook also includes a function to test a model, which takes a model as input and prints the accuracy of the model on the training and test sets.
