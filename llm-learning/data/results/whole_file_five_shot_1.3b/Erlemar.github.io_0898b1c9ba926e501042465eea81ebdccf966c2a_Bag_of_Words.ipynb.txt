1. `<Cell_0>` to `<Cell_1>`: There are some typos in the code. The correct import statements are:
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    import re
    import nltk
    from nltk.corpus import stopwords
    from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
    from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    ```
    2. `<Cell_2>` to `<Cell_3>`: The function `text_to_words` is not defined. It should be defined as shown in the code.
    3. `<Cell_4>` to `<Cell_5>`: The function `clean` is not defined. It should be defined as shown in the code.
    4. `<Cell_6>` to `<Cell_7>`: The function `vectorizer` is not defined. It should be defined as shown in the code.
    5. `<Cell_8>` to `<Cell_9>`: The function `train_reviews` is not defined. It should be defined as shown in the code.
    6. `<Cell_10>` to `<Cell_11>`: The function `y_val_m` is not defined. It should be defined as shown in the code.
    7. `<Cell_11>` to `<Cell_12>`: The function `y_pred_m` is not defined. It should be defined as shown in the code.
    8. `<Cell_12>` to `<Cell_13>`: The function `roc_auc_score` is not defined. It should be defined as shown in the code.
    9. `<Cell_13>` to `<Cell_14>`: The function `output` is not defined. It should be defined as shown in the code.
   10. `<Cell_14>`: The function `output.to_csv` is not defined. It
