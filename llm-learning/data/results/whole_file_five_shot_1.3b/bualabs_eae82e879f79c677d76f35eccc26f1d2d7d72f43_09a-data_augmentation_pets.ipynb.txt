    ## Conclusion

    The demonstration of the `advancedSearchDataset` in the `mmtfPyspark` library has demonstrated how to perform various types of advanced search queries on a PDB dataset. 

    The `advancedSearchDataset` provides a high-level interface to the PDB's advanced search functionality, allowing users to perform complex search queries on a large PDB dataset. 

    The demonstration demonstrated how to perform a simple stoichiometry query, a sequence query, and a chemical smiles query. 

    The results of these queries are then displayed, providing a valuable tool for researchers and scientists interested in exploring the PDB dataset.

    The demonstration also demonstrated how to perform a substructure search, a polymeric search, and a substructure search with a specific polymeric type.

    The `mmtfPyspark` library is a powerful tool for working with the PDB dataset, and the demonstration demonstrated its utility.

    In conclusion, the `advancedSearchDataset` in the `mmtfPyspark` library is a valuable tool for researchers and scientists interested in exploring the PDB dataset.
