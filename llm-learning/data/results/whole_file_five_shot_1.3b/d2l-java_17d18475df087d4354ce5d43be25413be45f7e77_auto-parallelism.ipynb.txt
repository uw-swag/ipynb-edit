    The code you've provided is a simple example of using the Deep Java Library (DJL) to perform some operations on GPUs. The code includes loading a Java class, creating a model, and running some operations on a CPU and a GPU.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The code starts by importing necessary libraries and classes.
    - It then sets up a Spark context and a Maven repository.
    - It loads a Java class using the `%load` command.
    - It defines a function `run` that performs some operation on a given NDArray.
    - It creates some NDArrays and runs the `run` function on them.
    - It calculates the time taken for CPU and GPU computations and prints it.
    - It also demonstrates how to copy data from a GPU to a CPU.
    - Finally, it calculates the combined time taken for GPU computation and copying to CPU, and prints it.

    The version of the D2L library you're using (`0.7.0-SNAPSHOT`) is quite old, and it's recommended to upgrade to a more recent version. The `0.8.0` version of the D2L library is not available at the time of writing this.

    Please note that the code is written in a Jupyter notebook, and it uses the `%` magic command to run Spark commands.

    Also, please ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed and the Spark and Maven environments are correctly set up.
