    The code you've provided is a baseline submission for a Kaggle competition. It's a simple baseline submission that uses a basic approach to predict the type of gift based on the weight of the gift. The code reads a CSV file with gift information, and then uses a simple distribution plot to visualize the distribution of weights for each gift type. The code also includes a function to generate a CSV file with the predictions.

    However, the code is not complete and there are some missing parts. For example, the function `gifts` is not defined, and the code for generating the CSV file with predictions is missing.

    The code also lacks some details, such as the distribution of weights for each gift type, and the calculation of the average weight of the presents.

    The code also lacks a clear understanding of the data and the problem statement, which can lead to inaccurate predictions.
