    The code you provided is a demonstration of how to use the Deepchecks library to perform a check on a dataset for index train-test leakage.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    1. The `dataset_from_dict` function is a helper function that takes a dictionary and an optional index name, and returns a `Dataset` object.

    2. The `IndexTrainTestLeakage` check is used to detect if the index in the test set is present in the train set.

    3. The `run` method of the `IndexTrainTestLeakage` check is used to perform the check on the given datasets.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the `IndexTrainTestLeakage` check with different parameters, such as `n_index_to_show`.

    Please note that the Deepchecks library is not installed in this environment, so you need to install it using pip:

    ```
    pip install deepchecks
    ```

    Also, please note that the code provided is a simple demonstration and may not cover all edge cases or potential issues. Always ensure to thoroughly test your code to avoid any unexpected behavior.
