    The code you've provided is a series of operations performed on a deep learning model using the FastAI library. Here's a brief explanation of each section:

    1. `<Cell_0>`: This cell is used to display the GPU information.

    2. `<Cell_1>`: This cell is used to reload the autoreload extension and set matplotlib inline.

    3. `<Cell_2>`: This cell is used to install the fastai library.

    4. `<Cell_3>`: This cell is used to import the necessary libraries.

    5. `<Cell_4>`: This cell is used to set the random seed for reproducibility.

    6. `<Cell_5>`: This cell is used to get the URLs of the PETS dataset.

    7. `<Cell_6>`: This cell is used to download the PETS dataset.

    8. `<Cell_7>`: This cell is used to list the files in the PETS dataset.

    9. `<Cell_8>`: This cell is used to list the annotations files in the PETS dataset.

    10. `<Cell_9>`: This cell is used to list the images files in the PETS dataset.

    11. `<Cell_10>`: This cell is used to find the pattern in the filenames.

    12. `<Cell_11>`: This cell is used to define the transformations for the images.

    13. `<Cell_12>`: This cell is used to define the batch transformations.

    14. `<Cell_13>`: This cell is used to define the batch size.

    15. `<Cell_14>`: This cell is used to define the data loaders.

    16. `<Cell_15>`: This cell is used to show the batch of images.

    17. `<Cell_16>`: This cell is used to define the data block.

    18. `<Cell_17>`: This cell is used to split the data into training and validation sets.

    19. `<Cell_18
