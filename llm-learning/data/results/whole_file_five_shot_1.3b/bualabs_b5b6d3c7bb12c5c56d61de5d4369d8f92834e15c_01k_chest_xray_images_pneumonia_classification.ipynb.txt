    The code you've provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses PyTorch, FastAI, and Kornia for a medical image classification task. It includes a number of cells for data loading, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

    The first cell imports necessary libraries and sets up the seed for reproducibility.

    The next cell mounts the Google Drive and downloads the dataset.

    The next cell defines the data loaders for the training, validation, and test sets.

    The next cell defines a custom transform for echoing the input data.

    The next cell defines a function for getting the data loaders with the specified batch size, size, and echoing factor.

    The next cell defines a custom loss function for focal loss.

    The next cell defines a model architecture and a learner for model training.

    The next cell performs a learning rate finder and fits the model.

    The next cell saves the model and loads it for inference.

    The next cell evaluates the model's performance and prints the results.

    The last cell is a placeholder for future code.
