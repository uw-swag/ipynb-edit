```python
    import os
    import shutil

    # Path to the directory where the notebooks are located
    notebooks_path = "/path/to/your/notebooks"

    # Path to the directory where you want to move the notebooks
    destination_path = "/path/to/your/destination"

    # Get a list of all notebook files
    notebook_files = os.listdir(notebooks_path)

    # Iterate over each notebook file
    for notebook_file in notebook_files:
        # Check if the file is a notebook
        if notebook_file.endswith(".ipynb"):
            # Get the full path to the notebook file
            notebook_full_path = os.path.join(notebooks_path, notebook_file)

            # Get the name of the notebook without the extension
            notebook_name = notebook_file.split(".ipynb")[0]

            # Get the full path to the destination folder
            destination_folder_path = os.path.join(destination_path, notebook_name)

            # Check if the destination folder exists
            if not os.path.exists(destination_folder_path):
                # Create the destination folder
                os.makedirs(destination_folder_path)

            # Move the notebook to the destination folder
            shutil.move(notebook_full_path, destination_folder_path)
    ```
    This script will move all notebooks from the specified source directory to the destination directory, with the name of the notebook being used as the name of the folder. If a folder with the same name already exists, the notebook will be moved to the next available folder.
