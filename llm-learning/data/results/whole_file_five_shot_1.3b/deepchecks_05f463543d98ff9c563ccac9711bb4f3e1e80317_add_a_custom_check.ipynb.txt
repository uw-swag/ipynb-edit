    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook and it's not clear what the purpose of this code is. It seems to be a custom DeepChecks check, which is a library for validating the quality of machine learning models. The check is comparing the sizes of the train and test datasets.

    However, without more context, it's hard to say exactly what the purpose of this code is. If you have any specific questions about it, feel free to ask.

    Here's the updated code:

    ```python
    from deepchecks import TrainTestBaseCheck, CheckResult, Dataset

    class DatasetSizeComparison(TrainTestBaseCheck):
        """Check which compares the sizes of train and test datasets."""

        def run(self, train_dataset: Dataset, test_dataset: Dataset, model=None) -> CheckResult:
            ## Check logic
            train_size = train_dataset.n_samples
            test_size = test_dataset.n_samples

            ## Return value as check result
            return_value = {'train_size': train_size, 'test_size': test_size}
            return CheckResult(return_value)
    ```

    This code is a custom DeepChecks check that compares the sizes of the train and test datasets.
