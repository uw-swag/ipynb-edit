```python
    <Cell_0>
    from IPython.display import FileUpload
    FileUpload()
    <\Cell_0>
    ```

    The above code will open a file uploader in Jupyter notebook. You can upload your files here and they will be available in your notebook.

    Please note that the uploaded files will be stored in the location where you run the notebook. If you want to store the files in a different location, you can specify the path in the `FileUpload()` function.

    For example, if you want to store the uploaded files in the current directory, you can use:

    ```python
    FileUpload(paths=['../input/your_file.csv'])
    ```

    Replace `'../input/your_file.csv'` with the path to your file.

    If you want to store the file in a specific directory, you can use:

    ```python
    FileUpload(paths=['/path/to/your/directory/your_file.csv'])
    ```

    Replace `'/path/to/your/directory/your_file.csv'` with the path to the directory where you want to store the file.

    If you want to store the file in a subdirectory of the current directory, you can use:

    ```python
    FileUpload(paths=['./subdirectory/your_file.csv'])
    ```

    Replace `'./subdirectory/your_file.csv'` with the path to the subdirectory where you want to store the file.

    If you want to store the file in a subdirectory of the current directory, you can use:

    ```python
    FileUpload(paths=['./../subdirectory/your_file.csv'])
    ```

    Replace `'./../subdirectory/your_file.csv'` with the path to the subdirectory where you want to store the file.

    If you want to store the file in a subdirectory of the current directory, you can use:

    ```python
    FileUpload(paths=['./subdirectory/../subdirectory2/your_file.csv'])
    ```

    Replace `'./subdirectory/../subdirectory2/your
