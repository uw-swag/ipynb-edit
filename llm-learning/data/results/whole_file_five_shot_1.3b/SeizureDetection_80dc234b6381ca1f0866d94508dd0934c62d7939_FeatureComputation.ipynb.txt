    The code above is a guide to extract features from the EEG signals. The features extracted are:
    1. Time Domain Features: Mean, Variance, Skewness, Kurtosis, Standard Deviation, Median, Zero Crossing Rate, Coefficient of Variation, Root Mean Square, Peak to Peak, Sample Entropy
    2. Frequency Domain Features: Power Spectrum, Theta Power, Alpha Power, Beta Power, Gamma Power
    3. Correlation Features: Correlation between the left and right hemisphere signals
    4. Seizure Detection: The most common seizure in the signal
