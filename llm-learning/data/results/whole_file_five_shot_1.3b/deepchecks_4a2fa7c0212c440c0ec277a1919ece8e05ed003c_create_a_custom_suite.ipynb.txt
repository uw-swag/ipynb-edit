    This is a Python script for a simple machine learning model using the DecisionTreeRegressor from the sklearn library.

    The script starts by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset. The dataset is assumed to be a CSV file with columns for 'Rooms', 'Bathroom', 'Landsize', 'Lattitude', 'Longtitude' and 'Price'.

    The script then drops any rows with missing values from the dataset.

    The script then splits the dataset into features (X) and target (y).

    The script then creates a DecisionTreeRegressor model and fits it to the training data.

    Finally, the script makes predictions for the first 5 houses in the dataset and prints the predictions.

    The script is designed to be run in a Jupyter notebook.
