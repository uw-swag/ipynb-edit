    The code you provided is a collection of examples and instructions for a machine learning project. Here's a brief explanation of what each section of code does:

1. **Importing necessary libraries and modules**: This section imports the necessary libraries and modules for the project.

2. **Loading the Iris dataset**: The Iris dataset is loaded from the sklearn library.

3. **Splitting the dataset**: The dataset is split into a reference dataset (for training the model) and a production dataset (for testing the model).

4. **Creating a K-Nearest Neighbors model**: A K-Nearest Neighbors model is created.

5. **Training the model**: The model is trained on the reference dataset.

6. **Making predictions**: Predictions are made on the reference and production datasets.

7. **Mapping the target and prediction columns**: The target and prediction columns are mapped to the correct column names.

8. **Creating a Dashboard**: A Dashboard is created to visualize the performance of the model.

9. **Saving the Dashboard**: The Dashboard is saved to an HTML file.

10. **Creating a Profile**: A Profile is created to analyze the performance of the model.

11. **Saving the Profile**: The Profile is saved to a JSON file.

12. **Generating a JSON file**: The JSON file is generated from the Profile.

13. **Generating a HTML file**: The HTML file is generated from the Dashboard.

14. **Generating a JSON file**: The JSON file is generated from the Dashboard.

15. **Generating a HTML file**: The HTML file is generated from the Dashboard.

16. **Generating a JSON file**: The JSON file is generated from the Profile.

17. **Generating a HTML file**: The HTML file is generated from the Profile.

18. **Generating a JSON file**: The JSON file is generated from the Profile.

19. **Generating a HTML file**: The HTML file is generated from the Profile.

20. **Generating a JSON file**: The JSON file is generated from the Profile.
