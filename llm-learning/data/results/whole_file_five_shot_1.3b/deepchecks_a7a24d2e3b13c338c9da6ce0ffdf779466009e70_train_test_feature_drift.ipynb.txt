    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook, and it's designed to perform a feature drift check on a dataset. The check is based on the TrainTestFeatureDrift class, which is a Deepchecks check. The check is used to compare the feature distributions in the training and testing datasets.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The code first imports necessary libraries and sets a seed for reproducibility.
    - It then generates a random dataset for training and testing.
    - The training dataset is a pandas DataFrame with two numeric and two categorical features. The numeric features are drifted by adding a random noise to them and a time-dependent feature. The categorical features are also drifted by encoding them using an OrdinalEncoder.
    - The training dataset is then converted to a Deepchecks Dataset object.
    - The model is a pipeline that first handles the categorical features and then uses a DecisionTreeClassifier.
    - The model is trained on the training dataset.
    - The model is then used to predict the labels for the testing dataset.
    - The check is then run on the training and testing datasets.
    - The check's result is printed.
    - Finally, a condition is added to the check to only include drift scores that are not greater than a certain value.

    The pprint.pprint function is used to print the conditions that were included in the check.

    Please note that the code is written in a Jupyter notebook format, and it uses the Deepchecks library to perform the feature drift check.
