The code you provided is a mix of Python code and Jupyter notebook cells. It's used to load a dataset, train a few machine learning models, and then use the `MultiModelPerformanceReport` to evaluate the performance of these models on the dataset.

The `MultiModelPerformanceReport` is a DeepChecks check that generates a report for comparing the performance of multiple models. It's used to compare the performance of different models, such as a machine learning model, a regression model, or a classification model.

The `Dataset` class is a utility class in DeepChecks that allows you to work with datasets in a more Pythonic way.

The `train_test_split` function is a built-in function in scikit-learn that splits the dataset into a training set and a test set.

The `load_iris`, `load_diabetes`, `load_boston`, and `load_breast_cancer` functions are built-in functions in scikit-learn that load datasets.

The `AdaBoostClassifier`, `RandomForestClassifier`, `DecisionTreeClassifier`, `AdaBoostRegressor`, `RandomForestRegressor`, and `DecisionTreeRegressor` classes are built-in functions in scikit-learn that implement machine learning algorithms.

The `MultiModelPerformanceReport` class is a method in DeepChecks that generates a report for comparing the performance of multiple models.

The `run` method of the `MultiModelPerformanceReport` class is a method that takes a training and test dataset, and a list of models, and returns a report of the performance of the models on the dataset.

The `cat_features` parameter in the `Dataset` class is used to specify categorical features.

The `features_columns` and `label_col` attributes in the `Dataset` class are used to get the features and label columns of the dataset.
