    The code you provided is a check for comparing the sizes of the train and test datasets. The check is implemented in the `DatasetSizeComparison` class, which inherits from `TrainTestBaseCheck`. The `run` method of this class is where the actual check logic is implemented.

    The `run` method takes as input the train and test datasets, and returns a `CheckResult` object. The `CheckResult` object contains the results of the check, which in this case is a dictionary with the sizes of the train and test datasets.

    The `display` attribute of the `CheckResult` object is a list of functions that will be called to display the results of the check. In this case, a bar chart is displayed, where the x-axis represents the dataset type (train or test), and the y-axis represents the size of the dataset.

    The `graph_display` function is a function that creates and displays a bar chart. It takes no arguments and creates a bar chart with the sizes of the train and test datasets.

    The `DatasetSizeComparison` class is then used to run the check on a train and test dataset. The result of the check is then displayed.

    The code you provided is a good example of how to implement a custom DeepChecks check. It demonstrates how to create a check that compares the sizes of the train and test datasets, and how to display the results of the check.
