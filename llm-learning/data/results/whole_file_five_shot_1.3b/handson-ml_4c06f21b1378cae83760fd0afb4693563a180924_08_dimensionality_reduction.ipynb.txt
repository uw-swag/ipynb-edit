    ### Explanation:
    # The code provided in the notebook is for dimensionality reduction techniques. It includes PCA (Principal Component Analysis), Isomap (Isometric Mapping), t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding), and MDS (Multidimensional Scaling). The goal of these techniques is to reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving as much of the data's information as possible.

    ### Explanation:
    # The code also includes a demonstration of how to use Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), a technique for dimensionality reduction that preserves local structures.

    ### Explanation:
    # The code also includes a demonstration of how to use t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), a technique for dimensionality reduction that preserves the relative distances between points.

    ### Explanation:
    # The code also includes a demonstration of how to use Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), a technique for dimensionality reduction that preserves the linear combination of the data's features.
