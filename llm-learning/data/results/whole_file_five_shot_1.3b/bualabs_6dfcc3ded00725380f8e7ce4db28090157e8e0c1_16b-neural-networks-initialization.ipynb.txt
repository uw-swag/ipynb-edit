The code is designed to initialize weights in a neural network with a method called "weight initialization". This method is used to prevent the vanishing gradient problem, which is a common problem in deep learning. The method used for weight initialization is called "Xavier initialization", which is a popular method used in deep learning.

The code also includes functions for normalizing the data, calculating the mean and standard deviation of the data, and applying the ReLU activation function. The code also includes a function to calculate the number of records, features, and classes in the data.

The code also includes a function to define a linear function, a function to apply the ReLU activation function, and a function to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the data after normalization.

The code also includes a function to define a weight matrix and bias vector, and a function to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the weight matrix.
