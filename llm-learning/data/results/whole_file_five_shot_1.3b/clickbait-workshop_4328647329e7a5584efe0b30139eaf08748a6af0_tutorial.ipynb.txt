    The code provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses various Python libraries to perform various tasks such as data analysis, data preprocessing, model training, and model evaluation. The code includes reading a CSV file, performing basic data analysis, and creating a machine learning model. The model is a Support Vector Classifier.

    However, the code provided is incomplete and does not perform the required tasks. It is missing the steps to train and evaluate the model, and it also does not provide the code for the incremental improvements of the classifier.

    Please provide the missing code for the incremental improvements of the classifier.
