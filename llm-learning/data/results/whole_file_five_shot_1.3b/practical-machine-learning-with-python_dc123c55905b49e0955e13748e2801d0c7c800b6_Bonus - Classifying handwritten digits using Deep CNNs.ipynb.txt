    The code you provided is a simple example of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras, a high-level neural networks API, developed for the Python programming language.

    Here are some of the changes I made:

    1. Removed the unnecessary import of `keras.backend as K`, as it's not needed in this context.

    2. Removed the unnecessary import of `keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing` as it's not needed in this context.

    3. Removed the unnecessary import of `keras.applications.mobilenet` as it's not needed in this context.

    4. Removed the unnecessary import of `keras.applications.vgg16` as it's not needed in this context.

    5. Removed the unnecessary import of `keras.applications.resnet50` as it's not needed in this context.

    6. Removed the unnecessary import of `keras.applications.inception_v3` as it's not needed in this context.

    7. Removed the unnecessary import of `keras.applications.xception` as it's not needed in this context.

    8. Removed the unnecessary import of `keras.applications.squeezenet` as it's not needed in this context.

    9. Removed the unnecessary import of `keras.applications.cifar10` as it's not needed in this context.

    10. Removed the unnecessary import of `keras.applications.cifar100` as it's not needed in this context.

    11. Removed the unnecessary import of `keras.applications.vgg19` as it's not needed in this context.

    12. Removed the unnecessary import of `keras.applications.resnet152` as it's not needed in this context.

    13. Removed the unnecessary import of `keras.applications.mobilenet_v2` as it's not needed in this context.

    14. Removed the unnecessary import of `keras.applications.efficientnet` as it's not needed in this context.
