```python
    from pyadlml.preprocessing import RawEncoder

    enc_raw = RawEncoder()
    raw = enc_raw.fit_transform(data.df_devices)

    # Now, you can use the 'raw' data for further processing.
    # For example, you can create a new feature that represents the length of each text message.
    raw['text_length'] = raw['message'].apply(len)

    # You can then use this new feature to train a model.
    # For example, you can use a logistic regression model to predict whether a text message is spam.
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

    X = raw.drop('spam', axis=1)
    y = raw['spam']

    model = LogisticRegression()
    model.fit(X, y)

    # You can then use this model to predict the spam status of new, unseen text messages.
    new_messages = ['This is a new message.', 'This is another message.']
    new_X = enc_raw.transform(new_messages)
    predictions = model.predict(new_X)

    # The 'predictions' variable now contains the predicted spam status for the new messages.
    ```
