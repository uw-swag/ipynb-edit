    The commit message "fixing docs (#898)" is a fix for a documentation issue. The issue is related to the 'IdentifierLeakage' check in the deepchecks library. The 'IdentifierLeakage' check is used to detect potential leakage of identifiers in the dataset. The issue is that the 'run' method of the 'IdentifierLeakage' class does not return any value, but the 'IdentifierLeakage' class should have a 'run' method that returns the result of the check.

    Here is the corrected code:

    ```python
    my_result = my_check.run(dataset=dataset)
    ```

    The 'run' method now returns the result of the check, which is a boolean value indicating whether the check was successful or not.
