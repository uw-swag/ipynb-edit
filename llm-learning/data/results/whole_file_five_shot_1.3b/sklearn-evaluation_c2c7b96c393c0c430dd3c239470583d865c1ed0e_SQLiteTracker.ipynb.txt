    The code provided removes the hardcoded experiment UUIDs. Instead, it uses the `SQLiteTracker` to log the results of each experiment, which includes the model used, the accuracy of the predictions, and the parameters of the model.

    The `tracker.new_experiment()` function is used to start a new experiment, and the `experiment.log_dict()` function is used to log the accuracy and parameters of the model.

    The `tracker.query()` function is used to retrieve the results of the experiments, and the `tracker.recent()` function is used to get the results of the most recent experiments.

    The `tracker.get()` function is used to get a specific experiment by its UUID, and the `tracker.delete()` function is used to delete an experiment by its UUID.

    The `tracker.delete()` function is used to delete the database file, which is created when the `SQLiteTracker` is initialized.

    The `tracker.recent(normalize=True)` function is used to get the results of the most recent experiments, and the `tracker.recent()` function is used to get the results of the most recent experiments.
