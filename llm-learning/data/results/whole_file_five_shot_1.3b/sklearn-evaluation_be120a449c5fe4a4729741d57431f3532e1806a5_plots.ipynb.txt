The code you provided fixes the feature importance table column order. The order of the columns in the feature importance table is determined by the order of the features in the feature_list. The feature_importance function in the mmtfPyspark.datasets.tables module uses this order to sort the columns.

The code you provided also imports the make_classification function from sklearn.datasets to create a classification task with 3 informative features. The make_classification function is used to generate a random classification dataset. The feature_importance function in the mmtfPyspark.datasets.tables module computes the feature importances for the dataset.

The code you provided also imports the ExtraTreesClassifier from sklearn.ensemble to build a forest and compute the feature importances. The feature_importance function in the mmtfPyspark.datasets.tables module uses this forest to compute the feature importances.

The code you provided also imports the label_binarize function from sklearn.preprocessing to binarize the y_test. The label_binarize function is used to convert the y_test to a binary format. The roc and precision_recall functions in the mmtfPyspark.datasets.plots module use this binary y_test to compute the ROC and precision-recall curves.

The code you provided also imports the roc and precision_recall functions from sklearn.metrics to compute the ROC and precision-recall curves. The roc and precision_recall functions in the mmtfPyspark.datasets.plots module use the y_score to compute the ROC and precision-recall curves.

The code you provided also imports the confusion_matrix_ and roc functions from sklearn.metrics to compute the confusion matrix and ROC curves. The confusion_matrix_ and roc functions in the mmtfPyspark.datasets.plots module use the y_pred and y_score to compute the confusion matrix and ROC curves.

The code you provided also imports the OneVsRestClassifier from sklearn.multiclass to create a multi-class classifier. The OneVsRestClassifier classifier is used to compute the decision function. The decision_function method of
