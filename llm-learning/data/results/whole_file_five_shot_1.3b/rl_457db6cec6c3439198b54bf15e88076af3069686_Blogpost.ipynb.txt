    ## Table of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

    | Algorithm | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | Q-Learning | A method for reinforcement learning where the agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. |
    | Deep Q-Learning (DQN) | A variant of Q-Learning that uses a neural network to estimate the Q-value function. |
    | Policy Gradients | A method for reinforcement learning where the agent learns to make decisions by following a policy, which is a function that maps states to actions. |
    | Actor-Critic Methods | A method for reinforcement learning where the agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward, and to learn a policy that is used to make decisions. |
    | Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) | A variant of Actor-Critic Methods that uses a policy gradient to optimize the policy. |
    | Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) | A variant of Actor-Critic Methods that uses a delayed policy update. |
    | Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) | A method for reinforcement learning where the agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward, and to learn a policy that is used to make decisions. |
    | Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL) | A method for reinforcement learning where the agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward, and to learn a policy that is used to make decisions. |
    | Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) | A search algorithm for decision-making problems, where the algorithm explores the state space by creating a tree of possible actions and their outcomes. |
    | Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) | A method for decision-making in multi-armed bandit problems, where the algorithm chooses the action with the highest expected reward plus a confidence interval. |
    | Thompson Sampling (TS) | A method for decision-making in multi-armed bandit problems, where the algorithm chooses the action with the highest expected reward. |
    | Genetic Algorithms (GA) | A search heuristic for optimization problems
