    The code you've provided is a mix of Python and Jupyter notebook code, and it seems to be a part of a larger project. However, it's not clear what the purpose of this code is. It's a mix of data preprocessing, data visualization, machine learning model training, and saving predictions.

    Here's a brief explanation of what each part of the code does:

    1. Import necessary libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost, and sklearn.
    2. Load the training and test datasets.
    3. Create a subplot to visualize the distribution of the 'price_doc' column.
    4. Drop some columns from the training data.
    5. Get dummy variables for categorical variables.
    6. Standardize the features.
    7. Split the data into training and cross-validation sets.
    8. Train an XGBoost model on the training data.
    9. Make predictions on the cross-validation set.
    10. Save the predictions to a CSV file.

    Please provide more context or clarify what you're trying to achieve with this code.
