    The code you've provided seems to be a mix of Python and Jupyter notebook code. It's a series of operations on audio data, including loading and pre-processing the data, building a deep neural network model, training the model, and evaluating the model's performance.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The `load_examples` function loads audio files from a directory and returns the data, labels, and sample rate.
    - The `load_examples` function uses the `soundfile` library to read the audio files and normalize the audio data.
    - The `load_examples` function uses the `librosa` library to extract MFCC features from the audio data.
    - The `dnn_model` function defines a deep neural network model using Keras.
    - The model is compiled with an 'adam' optimizer and 'categorical_crossentropy' loss function.
    - The model is trained for 200 epochs with a batch size of 128.
    - The model's performance is evaluated on the test set.

    Please note that the code is quite long and complex, and it's not clear what the purpose of the code is. It seems to be a mix of audio processing and machine learning tasks.

    If you have any specific questions about the code, feel free to ask!
