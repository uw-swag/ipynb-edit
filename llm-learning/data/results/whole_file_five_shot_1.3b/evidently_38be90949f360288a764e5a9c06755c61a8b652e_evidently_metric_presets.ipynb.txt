The code you provided is a collection of examples of how to use the `evidently` library to create and analyze reports of different metrics for different datasets.

The `evidently` library is a Python library for creating and analyzing reports of different metrics for different datasets. It provides a wide range of metrics and presets for different types of datasets.

Here are the examples:

1. `DataDriftPreset()`: This metric preset calculates the statistical properties of the data, such as mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis, and compares them to the reference data.

2. `DataQuality()`: This metric preset checks the quality of the data, such as missing values, outliers, and duplicate rows.

3. `RegressionPerformance()`: This metric preset calculates the performance metrics for regression tasks, such as RMSE, MAE, R-squared, etc.

4. `ClassificationPerformance()`: This metric preset calculates the performance metrics for classification tasks, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, etc.

5. `NumTargetDrift()`: This metric preset calculates the statistical properties of the target variable for numerical target drift tasks.

6. `CatTargetDrift()`: This metric preset calculates the statistical properties of the target variable for categorical target drift tasks.

7. `DataQuality()`: This metric preset checks the quality of the data, such as missing values, outliers, and duplicate rows.

8. `ClassificationPerformance()`: This metric preset calculates the performance metrics for classification tasks, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, etc.

9. `CatTargetDrift()`: This metric preset calculates the statistical properties of the target variable for categorical target drift tasks.

10. `NumTargetDrift()`: This metric preset calculates the statistical properties of the target variable for numerical target drift tasks.

11. `RegressionPerformance()`: This metric preset calculates the performance metrics for regression tasks, such as RMSE, MAE, R-squared, etc.
