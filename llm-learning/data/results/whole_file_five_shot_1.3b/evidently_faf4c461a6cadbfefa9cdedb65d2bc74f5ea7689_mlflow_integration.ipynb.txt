    ### Response:
    Here are some examples of how to use GitBook docs:

    1. **Creating a new page:**

        You can create a new page by adding a new markdown file to the `docs` directory. The file name should be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.

        For example, you can create a new markdown file at `docs/2018-08-15-hello-world.md` with the following content:

        ```markdown
        # Hello World

        This is a simple example of a markdown file.
        ---
        category: introduction
        ---

        Hello, world!
        ```

    2. **Adding a new category:**

        You can add a new category by adding a new markdown file to the `docs` directory. The file name should be `categories.md`.

        For example, you can add a new category at `docs/categories.md` with the following content:

        ```markdown
        ---
        category: new-category
        ---

        This is a new category.
        ```

    3. **Adding a new example:**

        You can add a new example by adding a new markdown file to the `docs/examples` directory. The file name should be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.

        For example, you can add a new markdown file at `docs/examples/2018-08-15-hello-world.md` with the following content:

        ```markdown
        # Hello World

        This is a simple example of a markdown file.
        ---
        category: introduction
        ---

        Hello, world!
        ```

    4. **Linking a page to a category:**

        You can link a page to a category by adding a `category` field to the front matter of the markdown file.

        For example,
