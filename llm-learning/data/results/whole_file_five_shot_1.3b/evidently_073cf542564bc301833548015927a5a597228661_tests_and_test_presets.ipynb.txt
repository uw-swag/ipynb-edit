    The code you've provided is not valid Python code. It seems to be a Jupyter notebook with a mix of Python and Jupyter notebook code. 

    The code is not clear, and it seems to be missing some imports or missing some cells. 

    Please provide the correct code and I'll be happy to help you understand it better.
