    # Section 2.5: Automatic Differentiation (#80)
    # In this section, we will discuss how to perform automatic differentiation in PyTorch.
    # We will use the autograd package to perform automatic differentiation.
    # We will also discuss how to use the .backward() method to compute gradients.
    # Finally, we will show how to use the .grad attribute to access the gradients.
