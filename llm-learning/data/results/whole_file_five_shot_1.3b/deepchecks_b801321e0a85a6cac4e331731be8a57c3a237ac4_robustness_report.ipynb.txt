    ## Update Robustness Report Notebook (#913)

    ### Overview
    This notebook provides a robustness report for a model trained on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a dataset of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits, along with labels. The notebook uses the DeepChecks library to generate a robustness report, which provides insights into the model's robustness.

    ### Steps
    1. **Data Loading**: Load the MNIST dataset and the model.
    2. **Model Training**: Train the model on the MNIST dataset.
    3. **Robustness Report Generation**: Generate a robustness report using DeepChecks.
    4. **Degradation Condition Check**: Check the robustness report for a condition where the model's prediction is not greater than 0.05.

    ### Results
    The robustness report provides insights into the model's robustness. It includes metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, as well as the distribution of prediction values. The report also shows the distribution of prediction values for each class, which can help identify any potential issues with the model's predictions.

    ### Conclusion
    This notebook provides a robustness report for a model trained on the MNIST dataset. By analyzing the report, you can gain insights into the model's performance and identify any potential issues.

    ## Note
    The notebook assumes that the DeepChecks library is installed and the necessary dependencies are installed. If not, you can install it using pip:
    ```
    pip install deepchecks
    ```
    And for the MNIST dataset, you can use the following command:
    ```
    pip install deepchecks-vision
    ```
    And for the model, you can use any model that is compatible with the DeepChecks library.
    ```
    ## Note
    The notebook is a basic example and may need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of your project.
