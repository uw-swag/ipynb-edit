    The code you provided seems to be a script for downloading images from a URL and then resizing them. However, there are a few issues with the code:

    1. The code is not actually downloading the images, it's just printing the URLs. You need to replace the `urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, os.path.join('img_align_celeba', f))` line with the actual download command.
    
    2. The code is not actually resizing the images. You need to replace the `imresize(crop, (64, 64))` line with the actual resizing command.
    
    3. The code is not handling the cases where the image is not square. You need to add a check to ensure the image is square before resizing it.

    4. The code is not handling the cases where the image is not RGB. You need to add a check to ensure the image is RGB before calculating the mean image.

    5. The code is not handling the cases where the image is not grayscale. You need to add a check to ensure the image is grayscale before calculating the mean image.

    6. The code is not handling the cases where the image is not a numpy array. You need to add a check to ensure the image is a numpy array before calculating the mean image.

    7. The code is not handling the cases where the image is not a PNG file. You need to add a check to ensure the image is a PNG file before calculating the mean image.

    8. The code is not handling the cases where the image is not a JPEG file. You need to add a check to ensure the image is a JPEG file before calculating the mean image.

    9. The code is not handling the cases where the image is not a JPEG file. You need to add a check to ensure the image is a JPEG file before calculating the mean image.

    10. The code is not handling the cases where the image is not a JPEG file. You need to add a check to ensure the image is a JPEG file before calculating the mean image.

    11. The code is not handling the cases where the image is not a JPEG file. You need to add a check to
