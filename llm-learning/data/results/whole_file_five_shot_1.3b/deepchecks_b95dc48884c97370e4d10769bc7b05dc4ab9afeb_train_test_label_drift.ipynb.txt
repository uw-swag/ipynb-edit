    # remove label_name from dataset constructor
    # (#456)
    #
    # This commit removes the label_name parameter from the dataset constructor.
    # This is done to ensure that the dataset constructor is flexible enough to handle datasets with different label names.
    #
    # The label_name parameter is removed from the constructor to allow the dataset constructor to be used with datasets
    # that have different label names.
    #
    # The label_name parameter is not removed from the constructor to ensure that the dataset constructor is not
    # overly restrictive and can be used with datasets that have different label names.
