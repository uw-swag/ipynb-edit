    The code you provided is a refactoring of a class in a machine learning project. The refactoring involved changing the number of cores used in the training process. The new number of cores is 4.

    The refactoring was done to improve the efficiency of the training process by using more cores. This is particularly important in a machine learning project where the training process can be computationally intensive.

    The refactoring was done by modifying the number of cores used in the training process. The new number of cores is 4.
