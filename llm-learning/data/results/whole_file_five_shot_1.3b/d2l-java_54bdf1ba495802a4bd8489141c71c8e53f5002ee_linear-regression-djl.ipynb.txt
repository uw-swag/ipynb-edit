    The commit message "Update Ch3 Linear Networks to 0.7.0-SNAPSHOT (#9)" is updating the version of the ai.djl library to 0.7.0-SNAPSHOT. This is a snapshot version, which means it is an unstable version and may not be suitable for production use.

    The code cells are loading the necessary libraries and classes for the linear networks. The version of the ai.djl library is also updated to 0.7.0-SNAPSHOT.

    The code also includes the creation of a DataPoints object, which is used to create a synthetic dataset for training. The DataPoints object is also used to load the array data and labels from a file.

    The code also includes the creation of a model, a sequential block, and a linear block. The model is then set as the block for the model.

    The code also includes the creation of a loss function, an optimizer, a tracker, and a metrics object. The model is then trained using these objects.

    The code also includes the training loop, the initialization of the parameters, and the training of the model.

    The code also includes the code to load the model, get the parameters, and print the error in estimating the parameters.

    The code also includes the saving of the model.
