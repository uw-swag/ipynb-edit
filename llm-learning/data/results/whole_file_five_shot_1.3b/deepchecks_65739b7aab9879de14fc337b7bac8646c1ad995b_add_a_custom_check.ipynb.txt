    The code you provided is a GitHub action that uses DeepChecks to compare the sizes of the train and test datasets. The action is set up to run the check on the provided datasets and display the results.

    However, the code you provided is not complete and does not run as expected. The `run_logic` method in the `DatasetSizeComparison` class is not defined, and the `run` method is also not defined.

    Here is a complete version of the code:

    ```python
    from deepchecks.tabular import TrainTestBaseCheck, Dataset, Context
    from deepchecks.core import CheckResult


    class DatasetSizeComparison(TrainTestBaseCheck):
        """Check which compares the sizes of train and test datasets."""

        def run_logic(self, context: Context) -> CheckResult:
            ## Check logic
            train_size = context.train.n_samples
            test_size = context.test.n_samples

            ## Return value as check result
            return_value = {'train_size': train_size, 'test_size': test_size}
            return CheckResult(return_value)


    import pandas as pd

    # We'll use dummy data for the purpose of this demonstration
    train_dataset = Dataset(pd.DataFrame(data={'x': [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]}), label=None)
    test_dataset = Dataset(pd.DataFrame(data={'x': [1,2,3]}), label=None)

    result = DatasetSizeComparison().run(train_dataset, test_dataset)
    result
    ```

    The `run_logic` method is defined, and the `run` method is also defined. The `run` method will call the `run_logic` method and return the check result.
