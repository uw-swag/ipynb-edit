The commit message "links-checks github action fix (#775)" is a fix for a GitHub action. The action is used to run the DeepChecks suite on the Iris dataset, which is used in the original code. The action is used to ensure that the DeepChecks suite is working correctly and the results are as expected.

The code cells in the commit message are:

- `<Cell_0>` to `<Cell_1>`: This cell imports the necessary libraries and functions for the DeepChecks suite and the Iris dataset.
- `<Cell_2>`: This cell runs the DeepChecks suite on the Iris dataset and the fitted model.
- `<Cell_3>`: This cell displays the result of the DeepChecks suite.
- `<Cell_4>`: This cell provides help information about the `to_json` method of the `CheckResult` class.
- `<Cell_5>`: This cell serializes the result of the DeepChecks suite to a JSON string.
- `<Cell_6>`: This cell checks if the 'conditions_table' key exists in the serialized output.
- `<Cell_7>`: This cell loads the serialized output and displays the result.
- `<Cell_8>`: This cell runs the DeepChecks suite on the Iris dataset and the fitted model.
- `<Cell_9>`: This cell imports the full suite of DeepChecks checks.
- `<Cell_10>`: This cell runs the full suite on the Iris dataset and the fitted model.
- `<Cell_11>`: This cell checks if the 'results' key exists in the serialized output of the full suite.
- `<Cell_12>`: This cell loads the serialized output of the first result and displays the result.
- `<Cell_13>`: This cell counts the number of results in the serialized output of the full suite.
- `<Cell_14>`: This cell loads the serialized output of the first result and displays the result.

The code cells in the commit message are used to ensure that the DeepChecks suite is working correctly and the results are as expected.
