    ## Keras Notes
    Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation.

    Keras is built on top of TensorFlow, a powerful open-source platform for machine learning. It provides a high-level API, written in Python, for fast experimentation.

    Keras is built on TensorFlow's core infrastructure, but it can be used independently. It is designed to be easy to use, yet powerful enough for specific use cases.

    Keras is compatible with TensorFlow, CNTK, and Theano, and can be used with a variety of deep learning frameworks.

    Keras is used in a wide range of applications, from image recognition to natural language processing, and is used in many research papers and articles.

    Keras is used in the TensorFlow team's research and development.
