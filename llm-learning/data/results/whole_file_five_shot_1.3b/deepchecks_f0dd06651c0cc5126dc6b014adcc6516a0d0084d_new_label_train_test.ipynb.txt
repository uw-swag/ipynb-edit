    The code you provided is splitting many files in core and base. The `NewLabelTrainTest` function is a DeepChecks check that trains a model on the test data and validates it on the validation data. The `Dataset` class is used to create a dataset from a pandas DataFrame, and the `run` method is used to run the check.

    The first two cells are using the `NewLabelTrainTest` function to train a model on the test data and validate it on the validation data. The test data contains 100 rows of data with two columns, and the validation data contains 50 rows of data with two columns. The first two columns are used as labels, and the last two columns are used as features.

    The third and fourth cells are using the `NewLabelTrainTest` function to train a model on the test data and validate it on the validation data. The test data contains 100 rows of data with three columns, and the validation data contains 50 rows of data with three columns. The first two columns are used as labels, and the last column is used as a feature.

    The `run` method is used to run the check, and the results of the check are printed to the console.

    Please note that the `NewLabelTrainTest` function is a part of the DeepChecks library, and it's not included in the code you provided. You might need to install the DeepChecks library and import it before running the code.
