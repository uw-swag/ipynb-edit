    ## Overview
    This repository contains examples of machine learning models implemented in Python using the Scikit-learn library. The examples are divided into different categories such as data preprocessing, model training, and model evaluation.

    ## Getting Started
    To get started, you can clone this repository to your local machine and follow the instructions in the README.md file.

    ## Examples
    Here are some examples of how to use the different machine learning models implemented in this repository:

    1. **Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR)**: This model is used for regression tasks. It is a type of linear model that uses a kernel function to transform the input data and then fits a linear model on the transformed data.

    2. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: This model is used for regression tasks. It is a type of linear model that uses a support vector machine to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that distinctly classifies the data points.

    3. **Decision Tree Regression (DTR)**: This model is used for regression tasks. It is a type of supervised learning algorithm that uses a tree-like model of decisions and probability.

    4. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: This model is used for classification tasks. It is a type of instance-based learning algorithm that makes predictions based on the majority of the training data.

    5. **Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)**: This model is used for regression tasks. It is a Gaussian process regression model that is a probabilistic technique for approximating the value of a function.

    6. **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**: This model is used for classification tasks. It is a type of feedforward artificial neural network model.
