The commit message "remove label_name from dataset constructor (#456)" suggests that the label_name parameter is being removed from the Dataset constructor. This is a common practice in machine learning and data science to avoid confusion and potential issues with the label_name parameter.

However, the code you provided does not seem to have a direct impact on the label_name parameter. The Dataset constructor in deepchecks does not accept a label_name parameter. The label_name parameter is typically used in the PerformanceReport.run() method to specify the name of the label column in the dataset.

If you're seeing an error or unexpected behavior, it might be due to a bug in the deepchecks library or a misunderstanding of the Dataset constructor. In that case, please provide more details or check the deepchecks documentation for more information.
