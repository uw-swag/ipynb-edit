    The commit message "clear output and minor fix on notebooks (#121)" suggests that the notebooks are being cleared of any output, and minor fixes are being made to the code. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as syntax errors, incorrect imports, or other issues.

    The original code cells are not provided, but based on the commit message, it seems that the notebooks are being cleared of any output and minor fixes are being made to the code.

    The notebooks are being used to demonstrate the use of AI libraries in Python, and the code cells are demonstrating how to use these libraries to train a simple neural network.

    The notebooks are also used to demonstrate the use of the tablesaw library, which is a Python library for data manipulation and visualization.

    The code cells are demonstrating how to use the tablesaw library to create a line plot of data.

    The notebooks are also used to demonstrate the use of the mxnet library, which is a deep learning framework for Python.

    The code cells are demonstrating how to use the mxnet library to train a neural network.

    The notebooks are also used to demonstrate the use of the djl library, which is a Python library for deep learning.

    The code cells are demonstrating how to use the djl library to train a neural network.

    The notebooks are also used to demonstrate the use of the sklearn library, which is a Python library for machine learning.

    The code cells are demonstrating how to use the sklearn library to train a neural network.

    The notebooks are also used to demonstrate the use of the keras library, which is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.

    The code cells are demonstrating how to use the keras library to train a neural network.

    The notebooks are also used to demonstrate the use of the python library, which is a general-purpose Python library.

    The code cells are demonstrating how to use the python library to perform various tasks.

    The notebooks are also used to demonstrate the use of the numpy library, which is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices
