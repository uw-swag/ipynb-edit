    This notebook is designed to provide an introduction to Python programming, data analysis, and machine learning. It includes a variety of examples and exercises to help learners understand the concepts and techniques used in these areas.

    The notebook is divided into several sections, each of which includes a series of code cells. The code cells are used to write and run Python code. The output of each code cell is displayed in a cell below it.

    The notebook also includes a variety of markdown cells, which are used to write comments or notes about the code. These comments are not executed by the notebook, but are used to explain the code and the results of the code.

    The notebook also includes a series of code cells that use the LangChain library to generate responses to prompts based on a template. These cells are used to demonstrate how to use the LangChain library to generate responses to prompts.

    The notebook also includes a series of code cells that use the OpenAI API to generate responses to prompts. These cells are used to demonstrate how to use the OpenAI API to generate responses to prompts.

    The notebook also includes a series of code cells that use the output_parser object to parse the output of the chat model. These cells are used to demonstrate how to use the output_parser object to parse the output of the chat model.

    The notebook also includes a series of code cells that use the pprint module to pretty-print the output of the chat model. These cells are used to demonstrate how to use the pprint module to pretty-print the output of the chat model.

    The notebook also includes a series of code cells that use the response_schemas object to format the output of the chat model. These cells are used to demonstrate how to use the response_schemas object to format the output of the chat model.

    The notebook also includes a series of code cells that use the StructuredOutputParser class to parse the output of the chat model. These cells are used to demonstrate how to use the StructuredOutputParser class to parse the output of the chat model.

    The notebook also includes a series of code cells that use the get_completion function to generate responses to prompts. These cells are used to demonstrate how to use the get_completion function to generate responses to prompts.
