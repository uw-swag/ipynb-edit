    ## Capsule Networks

    Capsule Networks, also known as Capsule Networks, are a class of neural networks that are designed to work in a way that is similar to convolutional networks, but with a few key differences.

    The main difference is that the input to the network is a set of vectors, and the output is a single vector. The vectors are not the same size as the input vectors, but they are arranged in a way that allows the network to learn a function that can be used to map the input vectors to a single output vector.

    The key idea behind capsule networks is that they can learn to map the input vectors to a single output vector, even if the input vectors are of different sizes. This is done by using a capsule layer, which is a type of layer that can learn to map the input vectors to a single output vector.

    The capsule layer is a type of layer that can be used in a neural network. It is designed to learn to map the input vectors to a single output vector, and it does this by creating a set of capsules, which are small, learnable modules that can be used to map the input vectors to a single output vector.
