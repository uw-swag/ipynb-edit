```python
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

    # Assuming you have a DataFrame df with columns: ['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3', 'target']
    df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

    # Feature engineering
    # Here, we're creating a new feature 'feature4' by combining 'feature1' and 'feature2'
    df['feature4'] = df['feature1'] + df['feature2']

    # Encoding categorical features
    for column in df.columns:
        if df[column].dtype == 'object':
            encoder = LabelEncoder()
            df[column] = encoder.fit_transform(df[column])

    # Dropping original features
    df = df.drop(['feature1', 'feature2'], axis=1)

    # Saving the new DataFrame to a new CSV file
    df.to_csv('new_data.csv', index=False)
    ```
    This script performs some basic feature engineering and encoding on a DataFrame. It creates a new feature 'feature4' by combining 'feature1' and 'feature2', encodes categorical features, and finally, drops the original features. The new DataFrame is then saved to a new CSV file.

    Please replace 'your_data.csv' and 'new_data.csv' with your actual input and output file paths.

    Note: This is a very basic example. Depending on the specific requirements of your project, you may need to perform more complex feature engineering and encoding.
