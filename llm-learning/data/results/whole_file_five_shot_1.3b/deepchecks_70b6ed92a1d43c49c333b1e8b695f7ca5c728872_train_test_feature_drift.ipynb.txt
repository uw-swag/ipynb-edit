    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook. The notebook contains several cells, each of which is a piece of code. Here's a brief explanation of what each cell does:

    1. `<Cell_0>`: This cell imports the necessary libraries.

    2. `<Cell_1>`: This cell generates random data for training and testing.

    3. `<Cell_2>`: This cell displays the first few rows of the training data.

    4. `<Cell_3>`: This cell adds some randomness to the 'numeric_with_drift' column in the test data.

    5. `<Cell_4>`: This cell creates a pipeline for handling categorical features.

    6. `<Cell_5>`: This cell fits the model to the training data.

    7. `<Cell_6>`: This cell runs the feature drift check on the training and testing data.

    8. `<Cell_7>`: This cell displays the value of the feature drift check.

    9. `<Cell_8>`: This cell displays the value of the feature drift check.

    10. `<Cell_9>`: This cell adds a condition to the feature drift check to ensure that the PSI score is not greater than 0.2 and the Earth Mover's score is not greater than 0.1.

    11. `<Cell_10>`: This cell displays the conditions that were used in the feature drift check.

    The notebook also contains several comments, which explain what each part of the code does.
