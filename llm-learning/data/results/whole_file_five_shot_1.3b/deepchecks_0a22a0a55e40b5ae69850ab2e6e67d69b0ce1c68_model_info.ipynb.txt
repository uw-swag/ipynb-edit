```python
    <Cell_0>
from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
from deepchecks.checks.overview import ModelInfo

clf = AdaBoostClassifier(learning_rate=1.2)
ModelInfo().run(clf)
<\Cell_0>
    ```

    The commit message "Add check context (#700)" is added to the code cell. This is a context-based commit message, which is a way to provide additional information about the commit. In this case, the context is "Add check context (#700)". The number "#700" is a unique identifier for the commit, and it's used to track the commit history.
