```
    The code you've provided is a Jupyter notebook with several cells. The first cell imports necessary libraries and packages. The next cell downloads a dataset and shows an image from it. The next cell defines the target and prediction variables. The next cell trains a random forest regressor on the training data. The next cell runs a stat test on the data and logs the results. The next cell runs a data drift test and logs the results. The last cell runs a MLflow UI and logs the results.

    However, the code you've provided seems to be incomplete and doesn't run as expected. It seems like the code is missing some parts, such as the definition of the `anderson_stat_test` function, the definition of the `experiment_batches` list, and the definition of the `mlflow.set_experiment` and `mlflow.start_run` calls.

    Please provide the complete code so that I can help you debug it.
