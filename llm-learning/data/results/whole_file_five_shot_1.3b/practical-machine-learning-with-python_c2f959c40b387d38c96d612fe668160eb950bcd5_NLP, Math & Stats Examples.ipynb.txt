    Commit Message: "removing useless git LFS"
    Original Code Cells:
    '''
    import os
    import git
    import pandas as pd

    repo = git.Repo(".", search_parent_directories=True)
    lfs_files = [f for f in repo.lfs_objects]

    for file in lfs_files:
        os.remove(file.path)
    ```
    '''
    ]

    ### Response:
    The code provided is used to remove the large file storage (LFS) from a git repository. It first fetches all the large file storage objects in the repository, then it removes these files from the repository.

    However, it's important to note that removing LFS files is not recommended as it can lead to data loss. It's better to use LFS only if you're using Git LFS on a specific project.

    Also, the code provided is a simple example and might not work in all scenarios. It assumes that the repository is located in the same directory as the script, and that the repository is a Git repository.

    If you're using a different method to manage large files, you might need to adjust the code to fit your specific needs.
