    ## Code: Data Preprocessing

    ## Data Preprocessing in Python

    ## Introduction

    Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the data analysis process. It involves cleaning, transforming, and integrating raw data into a format that can be used for further analysis.

    ## Types of Data Preprocessing

    There are several types of data preprocessing in Python:

    1. **Data Cleaning**: This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors in the data.

    2. **Data Transformation**: This involves converting data from one format or structure into another. This can include scaling, normalization, and encoding.

    3. **Data Integration**: This involves combining data from different sources or databases.

    ## Libraries in Python

    Python has several libraries that can be used for data preprocessing:

    - **Pandas**: This library is used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions needed to manipulate structured data.

    - **NumPy**: This library is used for numerical computations. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

    - **Scikit-learn**: This library is used for machine learning algorithms. It provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.

    - **Matplotlib**: This library is used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

    - **Seaborn**: This library is used for statistical data visualization. It is built on top of matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

    - **SciPy**: This library is used for scientific computing in Python. It provides a collection of mathematical functions to operate on arrays.

    ## Conclusion

    Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the data analysis process. It involves cleaning, transforming, and integrating raw data into a format that can be used for further analysis. Python's libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy can be used to perform data preprocessing.
