    1. The code imports necessary libraries and modules.
    2. It defines a custom formatwarning function to ignore all warnings except the message.
    3. It reads a CSV file from a URL and converts it into a pandas DataFrame.
    4. It encodes categorical features and labels in the DataFrame.
    5. It creates a pipeline for preprocessing the data and a logistic regression model.
    6. It calculates the calibration score for the model.
    7. It loads the iris dataset from sklearn and trains a logistic regression model.
    8. It calculates the calibration score for the logistic regression model.
