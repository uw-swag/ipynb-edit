    The code you've provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses several libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and pyspark to perform data analysis and visualization. The notebook is designed to be interactive and allows users to perform various operations such as filtering, sorting, and plotting data.

    However, the code you've provided is not complete and does not seem to contain any code that can be run. It seems to be a mix of different libraries and data analysis tasks.

    If you have any specific tasks or questions related to this code, feel free to ask.
