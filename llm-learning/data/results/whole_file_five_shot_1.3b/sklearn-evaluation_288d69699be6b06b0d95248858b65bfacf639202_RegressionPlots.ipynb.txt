```
    import myst_nb
    myst_nb.nbconvert_myst_nb(notebook_path="your_notebook_path.ipynb", output_path="output_path")
    ```
    This code will convert the notebook to myst format and re-organize the sections. Replace "your_notebook_path.ipynb" with the path to your notebook and "output_path" with the path where you want to save the output.
