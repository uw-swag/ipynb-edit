The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook, and it seems to be related to medical image analysis and data augmentation. Here's a brief explanation of the changes:

1. The `max_lighting` data augmentation is not explicitly mentioned in the code. However, it's possible that the code is using data augmentation techniques to increase the size of the training set. This could be useful in cases where the dataset is too small to train a model effectively.
