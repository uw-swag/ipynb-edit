    The notebook titled "Event Store IOT Sensor Temperature Prediction" has been updated with the following changes:

    1. The README file has been updated to include the necessary information for the notebook.
    2. The generator has been updated to reflect the changes made in the notebook.
    3. The ML notebook has been updated to include the necessary steps for the model deployment on IBM Cloud Machine Learning.

    The notebook now includes the following cells:

    - Cell 1: This cell sets the host IP address, port, and database name for the Event Store connection.
    - Cell 2: This cell attempts to establish a connection to the Event Store.
    - Cell 3: This cell creates a SparkSession and an EventSession.
    - Cell 4: This cell opens the database in the EventStore.
    - Cell 5: This cell retrieves the table names from the Event Store.
    - Cell 6: This cell loads the event table into a Spark DataFrame and creates a temporary view.
    - Cell 7: This cell attempts to resolve the table schema from the Event Store.
    - Cell 8: This cell creates a pipeline for linear regression with the event data.
    - Cell 9: This cell selects the necessary variables for the linear regression model.
    - Cell 10: This cell splits the data into training and test sets.
    - Cell 11: This cell fits the model to the training data and transforms the test data.
    - Cell 12: This cell evaluates the model's performance using RMSE, MAE, and R2.
    - Cell 13: This cell prints the predictions from the model.
    - Cell 14: This cell stores the model in IBM Cloud Machine Learning.
    - Cell 15: This cell prints the error metrics from the model.
    - Cell 16: This cell prints the details of the model.
    - Cell 17: This cell prints the list of models.
    - Cell 18: This cell sets the use_cloud_ml flag based on the availability of the IBM Cloud Machine Learning service.
    - Cell 19: This cell uses the IBM Cloud Machine Learning service to deploy the model.
    - Cell 20: This
