The notebook you've provided is a comparison of two different versions of a model. The first version is loaded from a pickle file, and the second version is loaded from a different pickle file. The two models are then compared in several ways, including their performance on a test set.

The notebook also includes some code to calculate the covariance matrix of the 'is_correct' array, which is used to measure the similarity between the two models. The covariance matrix provides a measure of the degree to which the two models differ in terms of their predictions.

The notebook also includes some code to normalize the 'is_correct' array, which is a common preprocessing step in machine learning. The normalize function subtracts the mean and divides by the standard deviation, which can help to make the model's predictions more comparable.

The notebook also includes some code to calculate the correlation matrix of the 'is_correct' array, which is another measure of the degree to which the two models differ in terms of their predictions. The correlation matrix provides a measure of the degree to which the two models agree on their predictions.

The notebook also includes some code to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient of the 'is_correct' array, which is another measure of the degree to which the two models differ in terms of their predictions. The Pearson correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect positive correlation, -1 indicating a perfect negative correlation, and 0 indicating no correlation.

The notebook also includes some code to calculate the Spearman correlation coefficient of the 'is_correct' array, which is another measure of the degree to which the two models differ in terms of their predictions. The Spearman correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect positive correlation, -1 indicating a perfect negative correlation, and 0 indicating no correlation.

The notebook also includes some code to calculate the Kendall's Tau coefficient of the 'is_correct' array, which is another measure of the degree to which the two models differ in terms of their predictions. The Kendall's Tau coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect positive correlation, -1 indicating a perfect negative correlation, and 0 indicating no correlation.

The notebook also includes some code to calculate the Mann-Whitney U test
