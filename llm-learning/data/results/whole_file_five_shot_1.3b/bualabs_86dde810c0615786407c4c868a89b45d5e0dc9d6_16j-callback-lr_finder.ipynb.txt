    The error in the code is that the 'x' in '10e-1' is not a vector tensor. It's a number, not a tensor. The '10e-1' is a number, not a vector or tensor.

    The correct code should be:

    ```python
    x = torch.rand(n_input) # Samples float values from [0,1) uniform distribution (interval doesn't include 1)
    ```

    This line of code creates a tensor of random values with shape `(n_input,)`, which is a vector tensor.
