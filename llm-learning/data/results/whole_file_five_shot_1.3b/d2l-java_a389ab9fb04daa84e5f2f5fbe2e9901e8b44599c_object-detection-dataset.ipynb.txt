    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook, and it's written in Python. The notebook is using the Maven build system to manage dependencies, and it's also using the Deep Java Library (DJL) for machine learning tasks.

    The notebook is divided into several cells, each of which contains a different operation or task. The first cell is setting up the Maven repository, which is used to store the dependencies of the project. The next cells are importing necessary libraries and classes, and then defining a function to load the bananas dataset.

    The next cell is preparing the dataset for training. The dataset is loaded in a random order, and the number of samples is set to 32.

    The next cell is preparing the NDManager, which is used to handle the data in the dataset.

    The next cell is preparing the image data and labels, and then displaying the images.

    The last cell is a function that is used to display the images.

    The code is not complete, as it's missing the part that is used to train the model and deploy it to SageMaker.

    The commit message "Update website build (#32)" suggests that the build process for the website has been updated. The number after the hash (#) is the commit hash, which is a unique identifier for each commit.
