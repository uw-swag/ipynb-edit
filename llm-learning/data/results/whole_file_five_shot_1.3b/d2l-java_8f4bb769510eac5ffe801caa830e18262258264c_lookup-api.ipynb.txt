    The code above is a Maven import statement for the DJL (Deep Java Library) project. It imports the necessary libraries for using the DJL API and the MXNet engine.

    The `NDManager` class is used to create and manage ndarray objects. The `ones` method is used to create an ndarray with ones. The `Shape` class is used to define the shape of the ndarray.

    The `%maven` directives are used to add the DJL and MXNet libraries to the Maven project.

    The `import` statements are used to import the necessary classes and methods from the DJL and MXNet libraries.

    The `NDManager.newBaseManager()` method is used to create a new `NDManager` object.

    The `manager.ones(new Shape(4))` line is an example of how to use the `NDManager` object to create an ndarray with ones. The `new Shape(4)` part creates a shape with 4 dimensions, and the `ones` method creates an ndarray with ones.
