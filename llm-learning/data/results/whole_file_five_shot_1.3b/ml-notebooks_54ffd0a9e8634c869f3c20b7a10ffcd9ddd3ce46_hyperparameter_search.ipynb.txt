    ## Unfinished Notebook: hyperparameter_search.ipynb

    This notebook is currently unfinished as it contains the code for a hyperparameter search.

    The hyperparameter search is a process that involves tuning the parameters of a machine learning model to improve its performance.

    The notebook will guide you through the process of performing a hyperparameter search, from selecting the right model to tuning the hyperparameters.

    Please note that this is a simplified version of the notebook. The actual implementation may require more complex code and additional steps.

    The notebook will also include examples of how to perform a hyperparameter search using different machine learning libraries, such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, and PyTorch.

    The notebook will also include a section on how to interpret the results of a hyperparameter search, and how to use the results to improve the model's performance.

    The notebook is designed to be a hands-on guide, so you can interact with the code and adjust the parameters as needed.

    Please let me know if you need help with any part of the notebook.
