    ## 24b CNN Hook Notebook

    This notebook demonstrates how to create a custom Keras hook that can be used to monitor the training process of a 24-bit CNN.

    The 24-bit CNN is a type of CNN that uses 24-bit weights. This is a common type of CNN used in applications like image classification, where the weights are represented as 24-bit integers.

    The notebook will demonstrate how to create a custom Keras hook that can be used to monitor the training process of a 24-bit CNN.

    The notebook will also show how to use the custom hook to monitor the training process of a 24-bit CNN.

    The notebook will be divided into the following sections:

    1. **Creating a 24-bit CNN**
    2. **Creating a custom Keras hook**
    3. **Using the custom hook to monitor the training process of a 24-bit CNN**

    ## 1. Creating a 24-bit CNN

    A 24-bit CNN is a type of CNN that uses 24-bit weights. This is a common type of CNN used in applications like image classification, where the weights are represented as 24-bit integers.

    Here is a simple example of a 24-bit CNN in Keras:

    ```python
    from keras.models import Sequential
    from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)))
    model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
    model.add(Flatten())
    model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    ```
