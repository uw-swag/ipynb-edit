    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the fastai library to train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for a text classification task. The model is trained on the Human Numbers dataset from the fastai library. The code includes importing necessary libraries, mounting Google Drive, setting up the environment, downloading and loading the dataset, defining the model, training the model, and evaluating the model.

    However, the code you provided is not complete and does not include the complete code for the RNN model. The RNN model is defined in the cell 44, but the code for training the model is not provided.

    Please provide the complete code for the RNN model in the cell 44.
