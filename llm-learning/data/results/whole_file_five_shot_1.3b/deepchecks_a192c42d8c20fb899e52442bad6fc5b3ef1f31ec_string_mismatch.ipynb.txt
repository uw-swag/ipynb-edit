    Here is the updated code:

```python
from deepchecks.checks import StringMismatch
import pandas as pd

data = {'col1': ['Deep', 'deep', 'deep!!!', '$deeP$', 'earth', 'foo', 'bar', 'foo?']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data=data)
r = StringMismatch().run(df)

# Adding conditions
c = StringMismatch().add_condition_no_variants()
conditions_decision = c.conditions_decision(r)

print(conditions_decision)
```

In the updated code, we first import the `StringMismatch` class from the `deepchecks.checks` module. We then create a DataFrame `df` with the data. The `StringMismatch` class's `run` method is then used to run the check on the DataFrame.

The `add_condition_no_variants` method is then used to add conditions to the check. The `conditions_decision` method is then used to make a decision based on the conditions.

The decision is then printed out.
