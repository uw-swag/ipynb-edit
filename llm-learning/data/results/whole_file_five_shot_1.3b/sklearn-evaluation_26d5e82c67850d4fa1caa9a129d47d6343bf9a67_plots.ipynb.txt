The code you've provided is for creating HTML tables in Jupyter notebook. However, it seems like you're trying to use the `tables` module from the `sklearn_model_eval` package, which is not a recognized module in the current version of the `sklearn` library. 

If you're looking to create HTML tables in Jupyter notebook, you can use the `IPython.display` module. Here's an example of how you can create a table in HTML format:

```python
from IPython.display import HTML

# Create a table
table = """
<table>
<tr><th>Header 1</th><th>Header 2</th></tr>
<tr><td>Row 1</td><td>Row 1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Row 2</td><td>Row 2</td></tr>
</table>
"""

# Display the table
HTML(table)
```

This will display the table in a HTML format in the Jupyter notebook.

If you're looking to use the `tables` module from the `sklearn_model_eval` package, you might need to use a different approach. The `tables` module in `sklearn_model_eval` is designed to create tables in a more user-friendly format, and it's not designed to create tables in HTML format.

If you need to create tables in HTML format, you might need to use a different library or tool. For example, you could use the `pandas` library to create a DataFrame, and then use the `pandas.DataFrame.to_html()` method to create an HTML table.
