```python
    import pandas as pd

    # Assuming that the CSV files are in the same directory as the notebook
    df_users = pd.read_csv('users.csv')
    df_orders = pd.read_csv('orders.csv')
    df_products = pd.read_csv('products.csv')

    # Now you can use these dataframes to perform your database operations
    ```
