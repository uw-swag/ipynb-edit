    The code you've provided is a Maven project configuration for a machine learning project. It uses the Deep Java Library (DJL) for deep learning, and the Tablesaw library for data manipulation and visualization.

    The project configuration includes:

    - Maven dependencies for the DJL and Tablesaw libraries.
    - A class `DataPoints` that represents a set of data points with features and labels.
    - A method `syntheticData` to generate synthetic data.
    - A method `linreg` for linear regression.
    - A method `squaredLoss` for squared loss.
    - A method `sgd` for stochastic gradient descent.
    - A training loop for a linear regression model.
    - Error checking after training.

    The training loop uses a batch size of 10 and a learning rate of 0.03. The model is trained for 3 epochs. The model's parameters are updated using stochastic gradient descent.

    The code is divided into several cells for better readability. Each cell contains a specific task or operation related to the project.
