    The code provided is a refactoring of a class in a Maven project. The refactoring involves changing the name of a class, which is not a typical refactoring in software development. However, the refactoring is done to improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

    The refactoring is done by renaming the class `TrainingUtils` to `TrainingUtils`. The change is made in the following lines of code:

    ```java
    %maven ai.djl:api:0.7.0-SNAPSHOT
    %maven ai.djl:model-zoo:0.7.0-SNAPSHOT
    %maven ai.djl:basicdataset:0.7.0-SNAPSHOT
    ```

    The refactoring is not a typical refactoring in software development, but it is done to improve the readability and maintainability of the code.
