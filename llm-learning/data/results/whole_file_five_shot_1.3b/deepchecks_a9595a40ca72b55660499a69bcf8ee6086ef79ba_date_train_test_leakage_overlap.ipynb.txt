    The commit message "fixing docs (#898)" is a fix for a documentation issue. The issue seems to be with the DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap check in the deepchecks library. The check is supposed to detect when the training and test datasets have overlapping dates, but it's not working as expected.

    The function `DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap` is supposed to return a DataFrame with the overlapping dates, but it's not returning anything.

    The function is supposed to run on two datasets: `train_ds` and `test_ds`. The function is supposed to return a DataFrame with the overlapping dates, but it's not returning anything.
