    The notebooks you've provided are used for data analysis and model training. However, you've mentioned that you want to delete them. 

    If you want to delete them, you can simply remove the code blocks from your notebooks. Here's how you can do it:

    ```python
    from deepchecks.tabular import Dataset
    from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier, RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from deepchecks.tabular.checks.performance import MultiModelPerformanceReport

    iris = load_iris(as_frame=True)
    train, test = train_test_split(iris.frame, test_size=0.33, random_state=42)

    train_ds = Dataset(train, label="target")
    test_ds = Dataset(test, label="target")

    features = train_ds.data[train_ds.features]
    label = train_ds.data[train_ds.label_name]
    clf1 = AdaBoostClassifier().fit(features, label)
    clf2 = RandomForestClassifier().fit(features, label)
    clf3 = DecisionTreeClassifier().fit(features, label)

    MultiModelPerformanceReport().run(train_ds, test_ds, [clf1, clf2, clf3])

    from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes
    from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostRegressor, RandomForestRegressor
    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

    diabetes = load_diabetes(as_frame=True)
    train, test = train_test_split(diabetes.frame, test_size=0.33, random_state=42)

    train_ds = Dataset(train, label="target", cat_features=['sex'])
    test_ds = Dataset(test, label="target",
