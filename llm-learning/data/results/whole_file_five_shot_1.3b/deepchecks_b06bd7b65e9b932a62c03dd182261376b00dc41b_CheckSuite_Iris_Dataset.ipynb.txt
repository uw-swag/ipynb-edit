    This script is a demonstration of how to use the Deepchecks library to perform various checks on a dataset.
    The script uses the Iris dataset from sklearn, a popular dataset for machine learning.

    The script starts by importing necessary libraries and setting a seed for reproducibility.

    It then loads the Iris dataset and splits it into a training set and a test set.

    The script then trains a RandomForestClassifier on the training set and evaluates it on the test set.

    The script then creates a CheckSuite object, which is a collection of checks that can be run on a dataset.

    The script then runs the CheckSuite on the trained model and the test dataset.

    The script also demonstrates how to create a custom CheckSuite and add a condition to it.

    Finally, the script demonstrates how to use the PerformanceReport check to generate a report of model performance.

    The Deepchecks library is a powerful tool for model performance and quality checks.

    ## Note
    The Deepchecks library is a part of the Deep Learning Toolkit (DLTK) and is not available in the standard Python library.
    You can install it using pip:
    ```
    pip install deepchecks
    ```
