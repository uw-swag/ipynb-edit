```
    The code you provided is a complete Jupyter notebook with a lot of cells. It includes importing necessary libraries, setting up the environment, reading and preprocessing data, defining the model, training the model, and validating the model.

    However, the code you provided is not complete. It seems like you're trying to run the training and validation process, but the code is not complete. You're missing some parts like defining the loss function, defining the optimizer, and defining the training and validation loops.

    Also, the code you provided is not complete. It seems like you're trying to save the best model during training, but the code is not complete. You're missing some parts like saving the model weights, and loading the best model weights.

    Please provide the complete code so that I can help you further.
