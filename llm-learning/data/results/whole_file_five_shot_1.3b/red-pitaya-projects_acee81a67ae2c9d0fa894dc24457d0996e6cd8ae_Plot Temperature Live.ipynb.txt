The code you provided is a live plotting of temperature data from an XADC (analog to digital converter) in Python using matplotlib. The data is appended to a pandas DataFrame, and then plotted in real-time. The temperature data is read from the XADC and appended to the DataFrame, and the DataFrame is then plotted.

The code is divided into three parts:

1. The first part initializes the necessary libraries and creates an empty DataFrame.

2. The second part defines a function `animate` that is called every 1000 milliseconds (or 1 second). This function reads the current temperature from the XADC, appends it to a clean DataFrame, and then appends this DataFrame to the global DataFrame `df`. It then plots the DataFrame.

3. The third part calls the `FuncAnimation` function to create the animation.

The fourth part writes the DataFrame to a CSV file every day.

The fifth part reads the current temperature from the XADC and prints it.

Please note that the `!xadc_get_value_temp` command is a placeholder for the actual command to read the temperature from the XADC.
