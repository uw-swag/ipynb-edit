    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook. It includes several cells where different operations are performed, such as data preparation, model training, and feature drift checks.

    The first cell imports necessary libraries and sets a seed for reproducibility. The next cell creates two random datasets, `train_data` and `test_data`, with a mix of numeric and categorical features.

    The next cell prepares the data for the model. It converts the categorical features to a format that can be used by the model, and adds some randomness to the numeric features.

    The next cell trains a decision tree model on the training data.

    The next cell runs the feature drift check on the training and test datasets.

    The next cell adds a condition to the check to ensure that the PSI (Peak Significance) score is less than 0.2 and the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) score is less than 0.1.

    The last cell prints the conditions that were used in the check.

    The code is written in a way that it should be easy to understand, with clear comments and variable names. The code is also formatted nicely, with proper indentation and spacing.

    The code is a good example of how to use the DeepChecks library to perform feature drift checks.
