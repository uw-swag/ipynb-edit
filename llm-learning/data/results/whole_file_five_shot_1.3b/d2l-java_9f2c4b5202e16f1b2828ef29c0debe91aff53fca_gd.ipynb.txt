    The code you've provided is a series of Maven commands to install and load various libraries, as well as a series of Java code snippets. 

    The first section of the code is setting up a Maven repository and loading some libraries. The second section is loading a Java class from a file. The third section is defining a function and its derivative, and then using a gradient descent optimizer to find the minimum of the function. The fourth section is defining a function and its derivative, and its Hessian, and using a Newton's method to find the minimum of the function.

    The last section is defining a function and its derivative, and its Hessian, and using a Newton's method to find the minimum of the function.

    The code is not complete, as it involves a lot of Java code and a lot of Maven commands. The complete code would be much longer and would depend on the specific requirements of the project.
