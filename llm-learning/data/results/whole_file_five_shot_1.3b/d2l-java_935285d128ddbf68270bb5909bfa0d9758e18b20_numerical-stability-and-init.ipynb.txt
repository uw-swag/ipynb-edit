    It seems like you're trying to update the mxnet-native version in your Maven project. However, the code you've provided is not valid. 

    Maven doesn't support SNAPSHOT versions directly. You can only use stable versions. 

    If you want to update the mxnet-native version, you should use a stable version. For example, you can use the version 1.7.0-a.

    Here is the correct code:

    ```
    %maven ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-native:1.7.0-a
    ```

    This will download the mxnet-native version 1.7.0-a.

    Please replace the version with the latest stable version.

    Also, make sure to check the latest version of mxnet-native on the official Maven repository.

    If you're using a Jupyter notebook, you can use the `%%capture` magic command to hide the output of the cell.

    Here is the updated code:

    ```
    %%capture
    %maven ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-native:1.7.0-a
    ```

    This will download the mxnet-native version 1.7.0-a and hide the output.

    Please replace the version with the latest stable version.

    Also, make sure to check the latest version of mxnet-native on the official Maven repository.
    ```
