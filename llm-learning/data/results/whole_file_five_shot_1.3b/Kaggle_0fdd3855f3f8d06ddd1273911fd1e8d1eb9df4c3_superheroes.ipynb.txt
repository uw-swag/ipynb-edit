    The code you provided seems to be a mix of Python and Jupyter notebook code. It's not clear what the issue with the DataFrame (DF) is. However, the code seems to be missing some imports, incorrect syntax, and it's not clear what the purpose of the code is. 

    If you could provide more context or clarify what the issue with the DF is, I would be able to provide a more accurate solution.
