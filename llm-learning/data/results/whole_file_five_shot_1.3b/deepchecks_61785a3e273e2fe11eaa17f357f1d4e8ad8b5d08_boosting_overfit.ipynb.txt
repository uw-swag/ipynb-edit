The code you provided is a modification of the original code. The commit message "Modifying check without function (#106)" suggests that the code is modifying a check without a function. 

The original code is importing a function from a module, but the function is not being used in the code. The function `boosting_overfit` is not being used in the code, and the check is not being used either.

The commit message "Modifying check without function (#106)" is a bit unclear. Could you please provide more context or clarify what the commit is supposed to do?
