    The code you provided seems to be a PyTorch-based reinforcement learning framework for portfolio management. It includes several sections for data loading, configuration, dataset building, network building, training, and testing. However, there are a few areas where the code could be improved.

    1. The `build_environment` function is used to build different environments for training, validation, and testing. This could be improved by creating a more generic function that takes a configuration and a task as input and returns the appropriate environment.

    2. The `build_net` and `build_optimizer` functions are used to build networks and optimizers, respectively. These could be made more generic by taking a configuration and a set of default arguments as input.

    3. The `build_loss` function is used to build a loss function. This could be improved by making it more generic by taking a configuration as input.

    4. The `build_transition` function is used to build a transition function. This could be improved by making it more generic by taking a configuration as input.

    5. The `build_agent` function is used to build an agent. This could be improved by making it more generic by taking a configuration, a set of default arguments, and a set of additional arguments as input.

    6. The `build_trainer` function is used to build a trainer. This could be improved by making it more generic by taking a configuration, a set of default arguments, and a set of additional arguments as input.

    7. The `cfg.dump` line is used to save the configuration. This could be improved by making it more generic by taking a file path as input.

    8. The `if task_name.startswith("style_test"):` line is used to handle different tasks. This could be improved by making it more generic by taking a list of trainers as input.

    9. The `trainer.train_and_valid()` and `trainer.test()` lines are used to train and test the agent. These could be made more generic by taking a set of default arguments as input.

    10. The `if task_name.startswith("train"):`, `elif task_name.startswith("test"):`, and `elif task_name.startsw
