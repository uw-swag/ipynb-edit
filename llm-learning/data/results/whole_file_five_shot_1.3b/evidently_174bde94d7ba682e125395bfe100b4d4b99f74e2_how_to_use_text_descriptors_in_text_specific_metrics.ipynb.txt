The commit message "#672" is related to a change in the regular expression used in the code. The regular expression is used to match and extract data from a string. The change is related to the use of the 're' module in Python, which is used for regular expression matching and manipulation.

The regular expression used in the code is:

```python
r'([^\s\w]+\s*[.,\/#\!\$\%\^&\*\(\)_\+`=\-\[\]\{\}\\\|;:<>?\"]+[^\s\w]*)'
```

This regular expression is used to match and extract data from a string. The string is matched using the `re.findall()` function, which returns all non-overlapping matches of the regular expression in the string as a list of strings. The string is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order found.
