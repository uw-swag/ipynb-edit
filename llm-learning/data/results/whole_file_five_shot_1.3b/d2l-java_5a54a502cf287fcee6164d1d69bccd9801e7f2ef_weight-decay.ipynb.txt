    The code in the commit message is not clear. It seems to be a refactoring of a class named "TrainingUtils" in a machine learning project. The class is used to train a machine learning model, and the refactoring is to improve the performance of the model by adding some features.

    The refactoring includes:
    1. Moving the training utilities to a separate class.
    2. Adding a new method to the class for training the model with weight decay.
    3. Adding a new method to the class for evaluating the model.
    4. Adding a new method to the class for visualizing the training process.

    The refactoring is not clear in the provided code, so it's hard to provide a detailed explanation of the changes.
