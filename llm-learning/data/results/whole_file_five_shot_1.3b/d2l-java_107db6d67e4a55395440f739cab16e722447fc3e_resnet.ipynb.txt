    The code you've provided is a Maven project that uses the AI DJL library to train a model for image classification. The project is quite complex and includes several dependencies, which are not included in the original code.

    Here are some of the changes I made:

    1. I removed the `%maven` directives as they are not needed for this project.
    2. I replaced the `%mavenRepo` directive with the correct Maven repository URL.
    3. I replaced the `%maven` directives with the correct Maven artifacts for the AI DJL library.

    Please note that the actual changes will depend on the specific dependencies and versions used in the project.
