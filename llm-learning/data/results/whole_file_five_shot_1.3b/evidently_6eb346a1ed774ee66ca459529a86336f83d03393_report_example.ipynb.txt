The code you provided is a part of a larger codebase, and it's not clear what the purpose of the code is. However, I can see that you're using the `evidently` library to create a report about data drift and classification performance metrics. 

The `metric_presets` and `tests_and_test_presets` are used to configure the metrics and tests that will be included in the report. The `how_to_questions` folder is where you can find examples of how to use these presets.

If you're looking for a specific example or explanation of how to use these presets, please provide more context or details.
