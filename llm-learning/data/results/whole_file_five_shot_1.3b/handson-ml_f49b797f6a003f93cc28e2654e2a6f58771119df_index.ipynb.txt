## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the process of building a recommendation system using the PySpark library.

## Setup

Before starting, ensure that you have the necessary software installed. You will need Python, pip, and the PySpark library installed.

## Data Preparation

The data used in this example is a dataset from Kaggle. It contains spam and non-spam messages, and the aim is to classify these messages as spam or not spam.

## Model Training

The model used in this example is a Naive Bayes classifier. It is a simple yet effective algorithm for text classification.

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy.

## Conclusion

This document provides a comprehensive guide on how to build a recommendation system using the PySpark library.
