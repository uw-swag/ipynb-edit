    ## Code: MLc 392 pps improvements (#338)

    ## Description:
    This code is for improving the performance of machine learning models. It includes checks for model performance, precision, recall, and confusion matrix reports. The code also includes a suite for model comparison and a custom check for handling leakage.

    ## Steps:
    1. Import necessary libraries.
    2. Load the iris dataset.
    3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
    4. Train a random forest classifier on the training set.
    5. Run the suite on the trained model and the testing set.
    6. Improve the performance of the model by removing certain checks.
    7. Update the suite with the improved checks.
    8. Run the updated suite on the testing set.

    ## Expected Output:
    The code should provide a suite for improving the performance of machine learning models. The suite should include checks for model performance, precision, recall, and confusion matrix reports.

    ## Note:
    The code is a demonstration of how to use the DeepChecks library to improve the performance of machine learning models.
