    The code provided is a series of functions and methods that are used to evaluate different machine learning models. Here are the main points:

    1. The code imports necessary libraries and functions from other modules.
    2. It reads a dataset from a configuration file.
    3. It preprocesses the data by applying various feature extraction and normalization techniques.
    4. It applies dimensionality reduction using PCA.
    5. It oversamples the minority class using SMOTE.
    6. It splits the data into training and testing sets.
    7. It trains and evaluates different machine learning models using the training data.
    8. It uses k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the models.
    9. It saves the performance indices of the models in a pandas DataFrame.

    The code is divided into several sections, each of which is responsible for a different task. For example, the code for reading and storing data is divided into the `read_and_store_data` function, and the code for feature extraction and normalization is divided into the `featureExtraction` and `featureNormalization` functions.

    The code also uses the `classificationPerformanceIndexes` function to calculate the performance indices of the models. This function takes the performance indices of the models and the test data as input and returns the performance indices of the models on the test data.

    The code also uses the `SVM`, `KNN`, `NaiveBayes`, `DecisionTrees`, `RandomForest`, `LDA`, and `LogisticRegression` functions to train and evaluate the models. These functions are defined in the `ipynb.fs.full.ModelEvaluation` module.

    The code also uses the `SVM_Kfold`, `KNN_Kfold`, `NaiveBayes_Kfold`, `DecisionTrees_Kfold`, `RandomForest_Kfold`, `LDA_Kfold`, and `LogisticRegression_Kfold` functions to evaluate the models using k-fold cross-validation. These functions are defined in the `ipynb.fs.full.ModelEvaluation` module.

    The code also uses the `importCsvToDataframe` and `exportDataframeToCSV` functions to import and
