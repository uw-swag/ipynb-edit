The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook that uses the Deepchecks library to perform overfitting checks on an AdaBoost classifier. Here's a brief explanation of the changes:

1. Added a new condition: `TrainTestDifferenceOverfit()`. This condition checks if the difference between the training and test set is overfitting.

2. Added new metrics: `'Always 0.5'`. This metric always returns 0.5, which is a common metric for overfitting.

3. Changed the `TrainTestDifferenceOverfit()` function to accept a dictionary of alternative metrics.

4. Added a new check: `TrainTestDifferenceOverfit(alternative_metrics={'Accuracy': 'accuracy', 'Always 0.5': lambda x,y,z: 0.5})`. This check uses the 'Accuracy' metric and the 'Always 0.5' metric as alternative metrics.

5. Added a new check: `TrainTestDifferenceOverfit().run(train_ds, train_ds, clf)`. This check uses the same train and test datasets to run the overfitting check.

6. Added a new check: `TrainTestDifferenceOverfit().run(train_ds, test_ds, clf)`. This check uses the same train and test datasets to run the overfitting check.

7. Added a new check: `TrainTestDifferenceOverfit().run(train_ds, train_ds, clf)`. This check uses the same train and test datasets to run the overfitting check.

Please note that the Deepchecks library is not installed in your environment. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install deepchecks
```
