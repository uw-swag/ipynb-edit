The code you provided is a collection of Python notebooks that perform various operations on audio data. Here's a brief explanation of what each cell does:

1. `<Cell_0>`: This cell imports the necessary libraries.

2. `<Cell_1>`: This cell reads the speech audio file.

3. `<Cell_2>`: This cell defines a function to shift a signal by a given number of samples.

4. `<Cell_3>`: This cell shifts the speech signal by 0 and 10 samples.

5. `<Cell_4>`: This cell defines a function to add gaussian (normal) distributed noise to a signal.

6. `<Cell_5>`: This cell adds gaussian (normal) distributed noise to the speech signal with SNRs of 40, 20, and 10.

7. `<Cell_6>`: This cell stretches the speech signal by a rate of 0.8 and 1.2.

8. `<Cell_7>`: This cell shifts the speech signal by -2 and 2 steps.

The code you provided is a good example of how to use different audio processing techniques to improve the performance of a machine learning model. It's important to note that the results of these operations can vary depending on the specific audio file and the noise added.
