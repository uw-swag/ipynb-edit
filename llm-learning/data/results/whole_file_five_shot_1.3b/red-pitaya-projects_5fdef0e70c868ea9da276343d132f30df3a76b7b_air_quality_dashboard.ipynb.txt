    The code provided is a demonstration of how to use the matplotlib library to create a real-time chart of air quality data. The chart shows various parameters of the air (temperature, VOC, alcohol, BM680 VOC, and pressure) over time. The data is collected from various sensors and stored in a CSV file for later analysis.

    The code also includes a slider widget for each parameter to allow for real-time adjustment of the parameters. The chart is animated to show the changes in the parameters over time.

    The code also includes a button to reset the parameters to their default values and a button to clear the data and start over.

    The last line of the code saves the last row of the data table to a CSV file.

    The code is written in Python and uses the matplotlib, pandas, and ipywidgets libraries.

    Please note that this code is a demonstration and may not work as expected in all environments.
    Also, the BME680 sensor and the PMS5003 particle sensor are used in this example. Please make sure to replace them with the correct sensor modules in your actual code.
    The code also assumes that the BME680 and PMS5003 sensors are connected to the correct I2C or SPI buses and that they are configured correctly.
    The code also assumes that the BME680 and PMS5003 sensors are connected to a Raspberry Pi or similar device.
    The code also assumes that the BME680 and PMS5003 sensors are connected to a computer with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse.
    The code also assumes that the BME680 and PMS5003 sensors are connected to a computer with a sufficient power supply.
    The code also assumes that the BME680 and PMS5003 sensors are connected to a computer with a stable internet connection.
