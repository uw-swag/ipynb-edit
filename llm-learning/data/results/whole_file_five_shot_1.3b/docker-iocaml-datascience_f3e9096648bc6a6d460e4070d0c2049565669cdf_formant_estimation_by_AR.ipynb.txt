    # Compute formant frequencies
    # This is a simple example and may not work well for all audio files
    # You may need to adjust the parameters or use a more sophisticated method
    # For example, you can use a machine learning model to predict the formant frequencies
    # based on the spectrogram
    # Note: This is a complex task and may require a good understanding of audio signal processing
    # and machine learning
    # You may need to use a library like librosa for this task
