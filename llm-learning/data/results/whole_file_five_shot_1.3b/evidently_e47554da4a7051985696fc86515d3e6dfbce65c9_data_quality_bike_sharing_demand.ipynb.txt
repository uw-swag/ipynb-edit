    ## How to generate test generators usage

    Test generators are used to create test data for machine learning models. They are a key part of the data science pipeline and are used to ensure the quality and reliability of the model's predictions.

    Here's an example of how to use test generators in the context of the bike sharing demand prediction model:

    ```python
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(ref_data[features], ref_data[target], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Create a test generator
    test_generator = TestGenerator(X_test, y_test, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

    # Use the test generator to generate test predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(test_generator)

    # Evaluate the model's performance
    mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f'Mean Absolute Error: {mae}')
    ```

    In this example, we first split the data into a training set and a testing set. We then create a test generator using the testing data. The test generator is a generator that yields batches of test data, which the model can use to make predictions. The `TestGenerator` class is a custom generator that takes the test data and the target variable as input and yields batches of test data.

    Finally, we use the test generator to make predictions and evaluate the model's performance. The `mean_absolute_error` function is used to calculate the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), a common metric for regression tasks.

    This is a simple example and real-world usage may require more complex data preprocessing, model tuning, and evaluation techniques.
