    The code provided is a demonstration of how to use semantic similarity descriptors in the evidently library. The semantic similarity descriptor calculates the semantic similarity between two columns of a dataframe. The semantic similarity is a measure of how similar two pieces of text are in terms of their meaning.

    The descriptors used in the code are:

    - TextLength: The length of the text.
    - IncludesWords: Checks if the text includes certain words.
    - OOV: Checks if the text includes words that are not in the English language.
    - NonLetterCharacterPercentage: Checks the percentage of non-letter characters in the text.
    - SentenceCount: Counts the number of sentences in the text.
    - WordCount: Counts the number of words in the text.
    - Sentiment: Checks the sentiment of the text (positive, negative, neutral).
    - RegExp: Checks if the text matches a regular expression.

    The semantic similarity descriptor is used to measure the semantic similarity between the 'Review_Text' and 'Title' columns.

    The semantic similarity descriptor is not available in the evidently library, but you can create your own by extending the `TextDescriptors` class and implementing the `calculate` method.

    The `calculate` method should return the semantic similarity between the two columns.

    The `SemanticSimilarity` descriptor is used in the `TextOverviewPreset` and `TextEvals` metrics.
