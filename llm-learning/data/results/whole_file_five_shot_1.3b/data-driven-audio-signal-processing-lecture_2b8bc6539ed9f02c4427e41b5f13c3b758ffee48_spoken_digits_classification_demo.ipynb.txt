    The code you provided is a part of a larger project, and it's not clear what the final output of this code is. However, it does load audio files, preprocess them, and train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model using TensorFlow.

    The RNN model is a simple LSTM model with two LSTM layers and a dense output layer. The model is compiled with the 'adam' optimizer and 'categorical_crossentropy' loss function, which is suitable for multi-class classification problems.

    The model is trained for 200 epochs, with a batch size of 64. The training and validation loss and accuracy are plotted for each epoch.

    Finally, the model's performance is evaluated on the test set. The classification report shows the precision, recall, f1-score, and support for each class.

    Please note that the code provided is a basic example and may need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of your project.
