    # Project Proposal

    # Title: Predictive Analytics for Sports Performance

    # Objective:
    The objective of this project is to develop a predictive analytics system for sports performance. The system will analyze various factors such as player stats, team performance, weather conditions, and more to predict the outcome of future games.

    # Requirements:
    1. Data Collection: The system will need to collect data from various sources to train the predictive models.
    2. Data Preprocessing: The collected data will need to be preprocessed to ensure it is in a suitable format for the predictive models.
    3. Model Training: The preprocessed data will be used to train different types of predictive models.
    4. Model Evaluation: The trained models will be evaluated using appropriate metrics to ensure they are performing well.
    5. Deployment: The trained models will be deployed to a live environment for real-time predictions.
