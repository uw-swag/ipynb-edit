```
    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the Deep Java Library (DJL) to train a machine learning model. The notebook includes import statements, dependencies, and code snippets related to model training, learning rate tracking, and loss functions.

    The code is divided into several cells. The first cell imports the necessary libraries and dependencies. The second cell loads the POM dependency for the TableSaw library, which is used for data manipulation and visualization. The third cell defines the SequentialBlock, which is a type of neural network, and the rest of the code is used to train a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) model using the DJL library.

    The code also includes a learning rate tracker, an optimizer, and a loss function. The model is trained for a number of epochs, and the results of the training and testing processes are collected and displayed using TableSaw.

    The code is written in Java, which is a common language for machine learning and deep learning. The DJL library is used to train the model, and the TableSaw library is used to visualize the results.

    The code is a good example of how to use DJL for machine learning in Java.
