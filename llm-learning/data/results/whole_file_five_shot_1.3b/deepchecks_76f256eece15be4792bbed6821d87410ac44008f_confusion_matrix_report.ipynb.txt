    [Automatic] Examples Update (#427)

    The examples have been updated to reflect the latest changes in the deepchecks library.

    The deepchecks library has been updated to version 0.7.0. This version includes several improvements, bug fixes, and new features.

    The example code has been updated to use the new version of the deepchecks library.

    The example now uses the AdaBoostClassifier from sklearn, which is now part of the deepchecks library.

    The example now uses the ConfusionMatrixReport check from deepchecks, which is a more efficient way to evaluate the performance of a model.

    The example now uses the iris dataset from sklearn, which is a popular dataset for machine learning.

    The example now splits the iris dataset into a training set and a test set, which is a common practice in machine learning.

    The example now fits the model to the training data, and then creates a dataset from the test data.

    The example now runs the ConfusionMatrixReport check on the dataset, which provides a detailed report of the model's performance.

    The example now uses the train_test_split function from sklearn, which is a common function for splitting data into training and test sets.

    The example now uses the Dataset class from deepchecks, which is a high-level interface for working with datasets.

    The example now uses the run method of the ConfusionMatrixReport check, which is a method that runs the check on a dataset and a model.

    The example now uses the feature_names attribute of the iris dataset, which is a list of the names of the features in the dataset.

    The example now uses the target attribute of the iris dataset, which is the name of the target variable in the dataset.

    The example now uses the run method of the ConfusionMatrixReport check, which is a method that runs the check on a dataset and a model.

    The example now uses the run method of the ConfusionMatrixReport check, which is a method that runs the check on a dataset and a model.

    The example now uses the run method of the ConfusionMatrixReport check, which is a method that runs the check on a dataset and a model.
