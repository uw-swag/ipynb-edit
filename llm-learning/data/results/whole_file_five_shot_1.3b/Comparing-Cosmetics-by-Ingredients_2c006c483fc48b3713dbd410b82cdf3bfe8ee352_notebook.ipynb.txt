```python
    # Adding files via upload
    from flaml.autogen.agent import UserProxyAgent

    # Define a function to upload files
    def upload_files(user, file_list):
        for file in file_list:
            user.upload(file)

    # Define a function to download files
    def download_files(user, file_list):
        for file in file_list:
            user.download(file)

    # Use the function
    upload_files(user, ["file1.txt", "file2.txt"])
    download_files(user, ["file1.txt"])
    ```
    This code will upload the files "file1.txt" and "file2.txt" to the user's workspace, and then download the file "file1.txt" from the user's workspace.
