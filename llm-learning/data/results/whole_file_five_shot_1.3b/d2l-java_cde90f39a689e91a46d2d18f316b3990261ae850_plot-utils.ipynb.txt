    The code above is a part of a Jupyter notebook that uses Plotly to render plots in a more efficient way. It uses the `tech.tablesaw` library to create and render plots, and the `ijava` library to render plots in a more efficient way.

    The `tech.tablesaw` library is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Java. It provides a wide range of features, including data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization.

    The `ijava` library is a Java-based rendering engine for Plotly. It allows for more efficient rendering of plots, especially for large numbers of data points.

    The `tech.tablesaw.plotly.api` package provides the main classes and functions for creating and rendering plots.

    The `tech.tablesaw.plotly.components` package provides the components for creating different types of plots.

    The `tech.tablesaw.plotly.traces` package provides the trace types for creating different types of plots.
