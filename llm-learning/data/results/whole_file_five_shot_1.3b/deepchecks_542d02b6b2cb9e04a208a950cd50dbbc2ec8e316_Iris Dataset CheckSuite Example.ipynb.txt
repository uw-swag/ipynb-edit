The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook and it's not clear what the purpose of the code is. It's a comparison of different models using the DeepChecks library. 

The code is splitting the Iris dataset into a training set and a test set, training a Random Forest classifier, and then running a suite of checks on the model's performance.

The checks include:

1. `ModelInfo`: This check provides information about the model, including the type of model, the version, and the parameters of the model.

2. `PerformanceReport`: This check provides a detailed report of the model's performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

3. `TrainTestDifferenceOverfit`: This check compares the performance of the model on the training set and the test set. It also checks for overfitting.

4. `ConfusionMatrixReport`: This check provides a detailed report of the model's confusion matrix.

5. `NaiveModelComparison`: This check compares the performance of the model to a naive model.

6. `NaiveModelComparison(naive_model_type='statistical')`: This check compares the performance of the model to a statistical naive model.

The code also creates a suite of checks and runs them on the model.

The last part of the code is a suite of checks that are not included in the previous code. It's not clear what these checks are for, but they could be used to compare the performance of the model to a naive model or a statistical naive model.
