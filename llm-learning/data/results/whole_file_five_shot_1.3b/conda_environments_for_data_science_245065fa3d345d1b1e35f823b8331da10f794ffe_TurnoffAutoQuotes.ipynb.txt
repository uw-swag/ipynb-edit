    # This is a Python code snippet that turns off auto quotes in Jupyter notebook.
    # This is useful when you're working in a Jupyter notebook and you want to avoid the auto-quoting feature.

    # First, you need to import the necessary libraries.
    from IPython.display import display, HTML

    # Then, you can use the following code to turn off auto quotes.
    display(HTML('<style>.code_cell { display: block; background-color: #f8f8f8; } .prompt { display: none; }</style>'))

    Commit Message: "Adding a new feature: 'add_feature'"
    Original Code Cells:
    '''
    def add_feature(df, feature):
        if feature in df.columns:
            return df
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"The feature {feature} does not exist in the dataframe.")
    '''
    ]

    ### Response:
    Here is a Python function that adds a new feature to a pandas DataFrame. This function checks if the feature exists in the DataFrame. If it does, the function returns the DataFrame. If it doesn't, it raises a ValueError.

    ```python
    def add_feature(df, feature):
        if feature in df.columns:
            return df
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"The feature {feature} does not exist in the dataframe.")
    ```

    This function can be used to add new features to a DataFrame. For example, if you have a DataFrame `df` and you want to add a new feature `new_feature`, you can do so as follows:

    ```python
    df = add_feature(df, 'new_feature')
    ```

    If `new_feature` does not exist in `df`, the function will raise a ValueError.
