The notebook is updated to include metric presets for data drift, data quality, regression, binary classification, multiclass classification, target drift, and binary classification with probabilities. The presets are based on the KS test for numerical statistics and the PSI test for categorical statistics. The threshold values for the presets are set to 0.2 and 0.2 respectively. The notebook also includes saving the reports as HTML, JSON, and dictionary formats.
