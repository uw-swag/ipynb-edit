    ## 8.4.1: Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks

    # Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of deep learning neural networks, which are capable of learning from sequences.
    # They are particularly useful for tasks that involve sequential data, such as time series analysis, natural language processing,
    # and more.

    ## 8.4.2: Building a Recurrent Neural Network

    # A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is built using a type of neural network called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).
    # LSTM is a type of RNN that is particularly good at learning from sequences.

    # Here is a simple example of how to build a RNN in Python using the Keras library:

    from keras.models import Sequential
    from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

    model = Sequential()
    model.add(LSTM(100, input_shape=(1, 1)))
    model.add(Dense(1))
    model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam')

    ## 8.4.3: Training a Recurrent Neural Network

    # After defining the model, you can train it using your data. Here is a simple example:

    import numpy as np
    data = np.random.random((1000, 1))
    model.fit(data, data, epochs=50, verbose=0)

    ## 8.4.4: Using a Recurrent Neural Network

    # Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions. Here is a simple example:

    prediction = model.predict(data)

    ## 8.4.5: Conclusion

    # In conclusion, RNNs are a powerful tool for tasks that involve sequential data, such as time series analysis.
    # They are also a good choice for tasks that involve long-term dependencies, such as language translation.
