    The code you provided seems to be a part of a Jupyter notebook, and it's using the Evidently library to analyze the chatbot's responses. The code includes several steps to evaluate the conciseness of the responses, such as using the OpenAI API for prompting, and it also includes several tests to evaluate the quality of the responses.

    However, the code you provided is not complete and does not seem to be a complete tutorial or guide. It seems to be a part of a larger codebase, possibly related to a specific project or dataset.

    If you could provide more context or clarify what you're trying to achieve with this code, I would be more than happy to help you further.

    Please note that the code you provided is a part of a larger codebase and it's not complete. It's not clear what the purpose of the code is.

    If you're looking for a complete tutorial or guide on how to use the Evidently library, I recommend checking out the Evidently documentation or the Evidently GitHub repository.

    If you have any specific questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.

    Thank you for your time and effort.
