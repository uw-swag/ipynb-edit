    # DenseNet Implementation Section 7.7 (#135)

    # Section 7.7.1 - DenseNet Architecture
    # DenseNet is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) that is designed to have a lower number of parameters than a CNN.
    # DenseNet consists of a stack of densely connected layers, where each layer is responsible for extracting local features.

    # Section 7.7.2 - DenseNet Implementation
    # DenseNet is implemented in PyTorch. The DenseNet121 model is a variant of DenseNet that has 121 layers.

    # Section 7.7.3 - Training DenseNet
    # DenseNet is trained using the Adam optimizer and the categorical cross-entropy loss function.

    # Section 7.7.4 - Evaluation DenseNet
    # DenseNet is evaluated on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

    # Section 7.7.5 - DenseNet with Batch Normalization
    # DenseNet is also trained with Batch Normalization, which is a technique to normalize the inputs to the activation function.

    # Section 7.7.6 - DenseNet with Dropout
    # DenseNet is also trained with Dropout, which is a regularization technique to prevent overfitting.

    # Section 7.7.7 - DenseNet with Hyperparameter Tuning
    # Hyperparameter tuning is performed to find the optimal number of layers, the learning rate, and the batch size for DenseNet.

    # Section 7.7.8 - DenseNet with Transfer Learning
    # DenseNet is trained on a pre-trained DenseNet model, which is a DenseNet that has been trained on ImageNet.

    # Section 7.7.9 - DenseNet with More Layers
    # DenseNet is further improved by adding more layers to it.

    # Section 7.7.10 - DenseNet with More Parameters
    # DenseNet is further improved by adding more parameters to it.

    # Section 7.7.11 - DenseNet with More Blocks
