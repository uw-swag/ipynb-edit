The code above is a demonstration of how to use the `SimpleModelComparison` check in Deepchecks, a library for data quality checks. The `SimpleModelComparison` check compares the performance of a simple model (like a random forest classifier) with a more complex model (like a decision tree).

The `SimpleModelComparison` check provides a variety of options to compare the performance of the simple model with the more complex model. For example, it can compare the accuracy of the simple model, the precision of the simple model, the recall of the simple model, and the F1-score of the simple model.

The `add_condition_gain_not_less_than` method is used to add a condition that the gain of the simple model should not be less than a certain value. This is useful to ensure that the simple model is not overfitting the data.

The `run` method is used to run the check on the training and test datasets.

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

- The `SimpleModelComparison` check is created with the type of simple model ('random', 'constant', or 'tree') that we want to compare.
- The `run` method is used to run the check on the training and test datasets.
- The `add_condition_gain_not_less_than` method is used to add a condition that the gain of the simple model should not be less than a certain value. This is used to ensure that the simple model is not overfitting the data.
- The `run` method is used to run the check on the training and test datasets.

The output of the `run` method will provide a report of the comparison between the simple model and the more complex model. This report will include the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the simple model, as well as the gain of the simple model.
