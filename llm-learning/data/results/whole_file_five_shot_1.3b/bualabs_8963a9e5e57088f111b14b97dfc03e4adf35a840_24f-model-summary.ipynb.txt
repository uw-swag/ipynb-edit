The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook that uses the FastAI library to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. The code imports necessary libraries and modules.
2. It defines a function `get_cnn_model` to create a CNN model.
3. It defines a class `GeneralRelu` that implements the Leaky ReLU activation function.
4. It initializes the CNN model with the specified parameters.
5. It defines a function `init_cnn` to initialize the weights of the CNN model.
6. It defines a function `model_summary` to print the shape of the output of each layer in the CNN model.
7. It creates a Learner object using the dataset and the CNN model.
8. The code ends with a summary of the model's architecture and the number of parameters in each layer.

The code also includes a stride description, which is a property of the convolutional layers in a CNN. Stride is a measure of how much the filter moves in the input image during the convolution operation. Stride 1 means that the filter is applied to the entire input image, while stride 2 means that the filter is applied to a 2x2 region of the input image, and so on. This property is used to downsample the input image during the convolution operation, which can help the model learn more general features.
