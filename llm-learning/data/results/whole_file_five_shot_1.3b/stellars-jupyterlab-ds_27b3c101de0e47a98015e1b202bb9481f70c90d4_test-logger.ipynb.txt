```
    # Dockerfile
    FROM python:3.7

    WORKDIR /app

    # Install dependencies
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

    # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
    COPY . /app

    # Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
    EXPOSE 80

    # Run app.py when the container launches
    CMD ["python", "app.py"]
    ```

    This Dockerfile creates a Docker image based on the Python 3.7 environment. It installs the dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file and copies the current directory contents into the Docker image at `/app`. The `EXPOSE` instruction makes port 80 available to the outside world. The `CMD` instruction specifies the command to run when a container is started from this image.

    The `app.py` file is the main script that will be run when the Docker container is started. It imports the logger and progress bar functions from the `logger` module, logs some example messages, runs a test function, and then creates a progress bar.

    The `requirements.txt` file lists the Python dependencies for the application. It's included in the Docker image because it's a standard practice to include dependencies in the Docker image.

    The Docker image is then built and run using the `docker build` and `docker run` commands, respectively.

    Please note that this is a very basic setup and might not be suitable for a production environment. For a production environment, you would need to consider more factors such as security, scalability, and performance.
