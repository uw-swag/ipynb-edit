    The code you've provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the KFP (Kubeflow Pipelines) library to create a pipeline for automl operations. The pipeline includes components for creating a dataset, training a model, evaluating the model, and deploying the model.

    The notebook also includes commands to set up git, install necessary packages, and clear the cache for AutoMLOps.

    The pipeline parameters are defined in the `pipeline_params` dictionary, which is passed to the `AutoMLOps.generate` and `AutoMLOps.go` functions. These functions then use the pipeline parameters to run the pipeline.

    The pipeline is scheduled to run at the specified schedule pattern (every 12 hours).

    Please note that the code is not runnable as it is, it's a template for a Kubeflow Pipelines pipeline. You need to replace the placeholders with your actual values.
