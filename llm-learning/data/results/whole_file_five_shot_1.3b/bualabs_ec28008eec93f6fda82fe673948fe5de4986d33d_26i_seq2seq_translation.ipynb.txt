    The code you provided has been deleted as it was not a valid commit message. The commit message "Finished model training 1st phase." is not clear enough to provide a valid commit message. 

    If you want to add a commit message, you can do so by replacing the comment at the end of the code with a valid commit message. For example:

    ```python
    # Finished model training 1st phase.
    ```

    Please provide a valid commit message so I can assist you better.
