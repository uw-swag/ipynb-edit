    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook and it's trying to perform several data analysis tasks using Pydantic, sklearn, and evidently.

    The first part of the code imports the necessary libraries and packages.

    The next part of the code imports the adult and housing datasets from sklearn's datasets module. The adult dataset is a UCI adult dataset and the housing dataset is a California housing dataset.

    The next part of the code defines the datasets for data quality and integrity tests.

    The next part of the code defines the datasets for regression and binary classification tests.

    The next part of the code defines the datasets for multiclass classification tests.

    The next part of the code defines the datasets for data integrity and data quality tests.

    The next part of the code defines the datasets for data drift tests.

    The next part of the code defines the datasets for regression performance tests.

    The next part of the code defines the datasets for classification performance tests.

    The next part of the code defines the datasets for probabilistic classification performance tests.

    The next part of the code defines the datasets for feature level tests.

    The next part of the code defines the color scheme for the visualization of the tests.

    The last part of the code defines the datasets for data drift column tests.

    The code is trying to perform several tests on the datasets. For example, it checks the data integrity of the datasets, checks the data quality of the datasets, and performs statistical tests on the datasets.

    The code also defines the color scheme for the visualization of the tests.
