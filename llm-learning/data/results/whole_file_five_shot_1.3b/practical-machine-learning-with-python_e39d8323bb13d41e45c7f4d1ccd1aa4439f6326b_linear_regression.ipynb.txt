    ## Chapter 6: Content for Chapter 6

    ### Section 1: Introduction

    In this chapter, we will explore the use of the Wikidata API to extract information about movies and their related entities. We will use the Python programming language to interact with the Wikidata API and extract data about movies and their related entities.

    ### Section 2: Data Collection

    We will use the Wikidata API to collect data about movies and their related entities. We will use the `search_wikidata` function to search for specific entities in Wikidata. We will also use the `find_wikidata_id`, `query_entity_links`, and `read_linked_entities` functions to extract the entity IDs and related entities from the Wikidata API.

    ### Section 3: Data Processing

    After collecting the data, we will process it to create a graph of related entities. We will use the NetworkX library to create the graph and the `nx.from_pandas_edgelist` function to create the graph from a pandas DataFrame.

    ### Section 4: Data Visualization

    We will use the NetworkX library to visualize the graph. We will use the `nx.draw`, `nx.draw_networkx_labels`, and `plt.show` functions to draw the graph and its labels.

    ### Section 5: Conclusion

    In this chapter, we have explored how to use the Wikidata API to extract information about movies and their related entities. We have also seen how to process the data and visualize it using NetworkX.
