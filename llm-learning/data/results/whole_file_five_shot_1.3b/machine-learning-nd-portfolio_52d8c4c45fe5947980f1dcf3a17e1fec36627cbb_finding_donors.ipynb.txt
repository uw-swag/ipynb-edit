```
    /data
    /notebooks
        /common
            /import_all.py
        /setup_notebook.py
    /README.md
    /.gitignore
    /.ipynb_checkpoints
    ```
    The above is a basic folder structure for a Python project. It includes:

    - `/data`: This directory is for storing any data files that your project might need.
    - `/notebooks`: This directory is for storing Jupyter notebooks.
    - `/common`: This directory is for storing common Python modules and functions.
    - `/README.md`: This is a markdown file that provides a README for the project.
    - `/.gitignore`: This is a file that tells Git which files it should not track or maintain a version history for.
    - `/.ipynb_checkpoints`: This is a directory for storing checkpoints for Jupyter notebooks.
    - `/`: This is the root directory of the project.
   
    This is a basic structure and can be adjusted based on the specific needs of your project.
