    This notebook is a demonstration of how to use the Google Cloud AI Platform, Google Cloud Build, and Google Cloud Storage to create a machine learning model, train it, and then deploy it for online prediction.

    The notebook includes a pipeline that performs the following steps:

    1. Fine-tunes a Flan-T5 model on a dataset.
    2. Uploads the trained model and tokenizer to Google Cloud Storage.
    3. Deploys the model to a Vertex AI endpoint for online prediction.
    4. Runs a prediction test on the deployed model.

    The pipeline parameters are defined in a dictionary, which is then passed to the `AutoMLOps.generate` function to create the pipeline. The pipeline is then provisioned, deployed, and tested.

    The notebook also includes a custom component for each step, which are used to perform the specific tasks. These components are defined in a separate Python file, and the `AutoMLOps.component` function is used to register them.

    The notebook also includes a custom pipeline function, which is used to define the entire pipeline. This function is then called with the pipeline parameters, and the pipeline is created.

    The notebook also includes a custom component for the prediction test, which is used to run the prediction test on the deployed model.

    The notebook also includes a custom component for the model deployment, which is used to deploy the trained model to a Vertex AI endpoint for online prediction.

    The notebook also includes a custom component for the model provisioning, which is used to provision the model in the Vertex AI service.

    The notebook also includes a custom component for the model deployment, which is used to deploy the model to a Vertex AI endpoint for online prediction.

    The notebook also includes a custom component for the model testing, which is used to test the deployed model.

    The notebook also includes a custom component for the model retraining, which is used to retrain the model with new data.

    The notebook also includes a custom component for the model versioning, which is used to version the model in the Vertex AI service.

    The notebook also includes a custom component for the model monitoring, which is used to monitor the model in the Vertex AI service.
