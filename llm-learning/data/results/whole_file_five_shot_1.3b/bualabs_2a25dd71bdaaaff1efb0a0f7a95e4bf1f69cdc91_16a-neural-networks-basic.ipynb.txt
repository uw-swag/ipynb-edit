    The code you've provided is a set of cells that define a number of functions and classes in Python. The functions and classes are used to perform various tasks such as data normalization, model training, and more.

    The refactoring of the code to move the model to a module level is a good practice as it makes the code more organized and easier to maintain. This is done by creating a new class `Model` that encapsulates all the operations related to the model.

    Here's a brief explanation of the changes:

    - The `Model` class is created. This class encapsulates all the operations related to the model, such as forward propagation, backward propagation, and loss calculation.

    - The `Module` class is created. This class is a base class for all modules in the model. It provides a common interface for all modules and includes methods for forward and backward propagation.

    - The `Relu` and `Lin` classes are created. These are subclasses of `Module`, which are used to define the layers in the model.

    - The `Mse` class is created. This is a subclass of `Module`, which is used to define the loss function.

    - The `forward_and_backward` function is defined. This function performs both forward propagation and backward propagation of the model.

    - The `forward` and `backward` methods of the `Model` class are defined. These methods call the `forward_and_backward` function to perform the forward and backward propagation of the model.

    - The `w1.g, b1.g, w2.g, b2.g` variables are defined. These are used to store the gradients of the weights and biases during the backward propagation.

    - The `Model` class is instantiated and the loss is calculated. The `backward` method is then called to perform the backward propagation of the model.

    - The `test_near` function is used to check if the gradients are close to zero.

    - The `forward_and_backward` function is called to perform both forward and backward propagation of the model.

    - The `w1.g.mean(), w1.g.std()` and `w2.g.mean(), w2.g.std
