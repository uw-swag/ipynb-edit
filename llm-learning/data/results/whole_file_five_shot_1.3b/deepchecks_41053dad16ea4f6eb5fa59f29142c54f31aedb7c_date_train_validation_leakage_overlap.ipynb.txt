    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook and it's used to create two datasets (`train_ds` and `test_ds`) and then run a check to detect any leakage in the training dataset.

    The `DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap` check is a methodology check that compares the training dataset with the test dataset. It checks for any leakage in the training dataset, i.e., if there are any dates in the training dataset that are not present in the test dataset.

    The `run` method of the `DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap` class is used to execute the check.
