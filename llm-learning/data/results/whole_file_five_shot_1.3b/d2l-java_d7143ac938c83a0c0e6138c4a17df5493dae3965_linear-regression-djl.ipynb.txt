    The commit message "Replace 10.0 snapshot with release (#91)" is replacing the 10.0 snapshot version of the ai.djl:api and ai.djl:model-zoo libraries with the 0.8.0 release.

    The original code was:
    ```
    %maven ai.djl:api:0.10.0-SNAPSHOT
    %maven ai.djl:model-zoo:0.8.0
    ```
    The new code is:
    ```
    %maven ai.djl:api:0.8.0
    %maven ai.djl:model-zoo:0.8.0
    ```
    This change is necessary because the 0.8.0 release of the ai.djl:api and ai.djl:model-zoo libraries are the latest stable releases and may contain bug fixes and improvements.

    The commit message "Replace 10.0 snapshot with release (#91)" is also adding a new line to the commit message to indicate that the 0.8.0 release of the ai.djl:api and ai.djl:model-zoo libraries are being used.

    The new code is:
    ```
    %maven ai.djl:api:0.8.0-SNAPSHOT
    %maven ai.djl:model-zoo:0.8.0-SNAPSHOT
    ```
    This change is necessary because the 0.8.0-SNAPSHOT release of the ai.djl:api and ai.djl:model-zoo libraries are the latest unstable releases and may not contain bug fixes and improvements.
