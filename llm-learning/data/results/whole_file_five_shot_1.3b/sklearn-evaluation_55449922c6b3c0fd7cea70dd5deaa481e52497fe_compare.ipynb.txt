    # Migration of docs to jupyter-book (#93)

    This is a migration of the documentation to the new Jupyter Book format.

    ## What is Jupyter Book?

    Jupyter Book is a project that aims to create a new, open-source format for Jupyter notebooks. It is built on top of the Jupyter Notebook project and aims to provide a more user-friendly and efficient way to share and present Jupyter notebooks.

    ## How to migrate

    1. **Clone the repository**: You can clone the repository from GitHub using the following command:

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book.git
        ```

    2. **Install the necessary tools**: You will need to install the following tools:

        - **Docker**: Jupyter Book uses Docker to manage the environment.
        - **Node.js and npm**: Jupyter Book uses Node.js and npm to build the documentation.

    3. **Build the documentation**: Navigate to the Jupyter Book directory and run the following command to build the documentation:

        ```bash
        docker-compose up
        ```

    This will start the Jupyter Book server and the documentation will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

    ## What's next?

    The next steps will be to migrate the existing documentation to the new format. This will involve updating the documentation to use the new Jupyter Book format and updating the documentation to include the new features and improvements.
