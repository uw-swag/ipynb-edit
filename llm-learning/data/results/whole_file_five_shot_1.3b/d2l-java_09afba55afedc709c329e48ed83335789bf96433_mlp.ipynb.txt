    The code you've provided is a series of operations using the Deep Java Library (DJL) and MXNet, a machine learning library for the Java platform. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    1. The first part of the code imports the necessary libraries and classes.

    2. The `NDManager` is used to create a new instance of the NDManager.

    3. The `x` variable is created and its gradient is calculated.

    4. The `y` variable is created and its gradient is calculated.

    5. The `y` variable is passed to the `Activation.relu()` function, which returns the ReLU activation function of `x`.

    6. The `y` variable is passed to the `Activation.sigmoid()` function, which returns the sigmoid activation function of `x`.

    7. The `y` variable is passed to the `Activation.tanh()` function, which returns the tanh activation function of `x`.

    8. The gradients of the ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh functions are plotted using the `render()` function.

    The code is using the DJL library to perform various operations such as activation functions, gradient calculation, and plotting.

    Please note that the code is written in a Jupyter notebook format, and it's using the Maven build system to manage dependencies. The `%maven` directives are used to add Maven dependencies to the notebook, and the `%load` directive is used to load a Jupyter notebook file.
