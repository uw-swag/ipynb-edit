    The code you provided is a Python script for a custom DeepChecks check, which is used to compare the sizes of the train and test datasets. The check is run on a model, but in this case, it's not used.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The `DatasetSizeComparison` class inherits from `TrainTestBaseCheck`, which is a base class for all checks that compare the sizes of the train and test datasets.

    - The `run` method is overridden to perform the actual comparison. It takes the train and test datasets as input, and returns a `CheckResult` object. The `CheckResult` object contains the results of the check, which in this case is a dictionary with the sizes of the train and test datasets.

    - The `display` method of the `CheckResult` object is overridden to create a bar graph that displays the sizes of the train and test datasets.

    - The `DatasetSizeComparison` class is then used to run the check on a model, but in this case, it's not used.

    The last cell of the code is an example of how to use the `DatasetSizeComparison` class to run the check and display the results.

    Please note that the code you provided is a demonstration of how to create a custom DeepChecks check, but it's not a complete solution. It's just a starting point. You would need to fill in the logic of the `run` and `display` methods, and possibly other methods based on your specific needs.
