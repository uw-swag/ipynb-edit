    The code you provided is for using a specific version of the AI library (`ai.djl`) in a Jupyter notebook. The version you're using (`0.6.0-SNAPSHOT`) is a snapshot version, which means it's not a stable release and may not be suitable for production use.

    If you want to use a stable version of the library, you should replace `0.6.0-SNAPSHOT` with the appropriate version number. For example, if you want to use version `1.0.0`, you should replace `0.6.0-SNAPSHOT` with `1.0.0` in the code.

    However, please note that the `0.6.0-SNAPSHOT` version of the library is not available in Maven Central, so you'll need to download the library from a source repository or a third-party Maven repository.

    Here's how you can replace `0.6.0-SNAPSHOT` with `1.0.0` in the code:

    ```
    %maven ai.djl:api:1.0.0
    %maven org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.26
    %maven org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:1.7.26
    %maven net.java.dev.jna:jna:5.3.0
    %maven ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-engine:1.7.0-a
    %maven ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-native-auto:1.7.0-a
    ```

    After replacing the version, you should be able to import the library in your Jupyter notebook without any issues.
