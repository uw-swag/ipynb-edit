```python
    from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
    import numpy as np

    # Assuming X is your data matrix
    X = np.array([[1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 0], [10, 2], [10, 4], [10, 0]])

    # Create a KMeans instance with 2 clusters
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=0).fit(X)

    # Get the cluster assignments for each data point
    labels = kmeans.labels_

    # Get the cluster centers
    centers = kmeans.cluster_centers_

    # Print the cluster centers
    print("Cluster Centers:")
    print(centers)

    # Print the cluster labels
    print("Cluster Labels:")
    print(labels)
    ```

    This code will perform K-Means clustering on the given data. The number of clusters is set to 2, but you can change this as needed. The `random_state` parameter is used to ensure that the results are reproducible. The `fit` method is used to fit the model to the data, and the `labels_` and `cluster_centers_` attributes are used to get the cluster assignments and centers.
