    The code you've provided is a complete Jupyter notebook with a lot of cells. It includes importing necessary libraries, loading data, visualizing data, handling missing values, creating dummy variables for 'Embarked', introducing dummies for 'Embarked', including a feature 'Fare', and introducing a feature 'Age'. 

    The code also includes creating a bar plot for the average survival rate of passengers with and without a family, and a count plot for the number of passengers with and without a family.

    The code also includes dropping irrelevant columns from the dataframes and creating a histogram for the 'Fare' feature.
