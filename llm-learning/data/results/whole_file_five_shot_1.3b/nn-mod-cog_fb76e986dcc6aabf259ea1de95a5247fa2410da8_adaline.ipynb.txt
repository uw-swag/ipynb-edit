    The code cells are mostly for demonstrating the use of the Perceptron algorithm, which is a simple yet effective algorithm for binary classification. The Perceptron algorithm is a type of linear classifier and is used for binary classification problems.

    The Perceptron algorithm is a simple yet effective algorithm for binary classification. It is a type of linear classifier and is used for binary classification problems. The algorithm works by iteratively updating the weights of the input features in a step-wise manner.

    The algorithm works by updating the weights in the direction that reduces the error. The error is calculated as the difference between the actual output and the predicted output. The weights are updated in a step-wise manner, with the error in the direction of the weights.

    The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), which makes it inefficient for large datasets. However, it is simple to implement and can be used for binary classification problems.
