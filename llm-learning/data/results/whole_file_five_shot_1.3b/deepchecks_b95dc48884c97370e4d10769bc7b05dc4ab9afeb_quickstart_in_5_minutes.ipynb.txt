The code you provided is used to remove the label_name from the dataset. The label_name is a parameter that is used in the train_test_split function to specify the column that contains the labels. In this case, the label_name is 'target', which is the name of the target column in the iris dataset.

Here's the modified code:

```python
# General imports
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(22)

from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load Data
iris_df = load_iris(return_X_y=False, as_frame=True)['frame']

# Train Model
rf_clf = RandomForestClassifier()
rf_clf.fit(iris_df.drop('target', axis=1), iris_df['target']);
```

In this code, the label_name is set to 'target' in the train_test_split function, which means that the target column in the iris dataset will be used as the label.
