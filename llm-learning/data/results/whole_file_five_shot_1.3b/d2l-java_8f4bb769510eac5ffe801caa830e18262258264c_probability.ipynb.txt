    The code you provided is a Java code snippet for a machine learning project using Deep Java Library (DJL). The code imports necessary libraries and defines some functions. 

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The code imports necessary libraries for machine learning and data manipulation.
    - The code defines a function `floatToDoubleArray` that converts a float array to a double array.
    - The code creates a multinomial distribution with 6 fair outcomes (1/6 chance each).
    - The code creates a multinomial distribution with 10 outcomes and draws 1000 samples from it.
    - The code counts the number of occurrences of each outcome and calculates the estimated probability for each outcome.
    - The code creates a histogram with the estimated probabilities for each outcome.

    The code also uses the `Functions` class to convert float arrays to double arrays, which is a utility class for handling float arrays.

    The code uses the `NDManager` class to handle numerical data, which is a utility class for managing numerical data.

    The code uses the `ScatterTrace` class to create scatter plots, which is a utility class for creating scatter plots.

    The code uses the `Layout`, `Axis`, `ScatterTrace`, `Functions`, `NDManager`, and `Marker` classes to create the scatter plot.

    The code uses the `Figure` class to create a figure, which is a utility class for creating figures.

    The code uses the `Layout.builder()`, `Axis.builder()`, `ScatterTrace.builder()`, `Functions.floatToDoubleArray()`, `NDManager.newBaseManager()`, `NDManager.randomMultinomial()`, `NDArray.cumSum()`, `NDArray.div()`, `NDArray.sum()`, `int[]`, `ScatterTrace.Mode.LINE`, `ScatterTrace.Marker.color("black")`, `new Figure(layout, traces)` methods to create the scatter plot.

    The code uses the `height`, `width`, `xLabel`, `yLabel`, `layout`, `traces`
