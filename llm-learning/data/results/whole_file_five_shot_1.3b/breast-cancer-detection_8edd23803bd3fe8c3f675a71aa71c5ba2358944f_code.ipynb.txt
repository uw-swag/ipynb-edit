    ## Implementing AdaBoost Classifier for improved model performance

    ## Importing necessary libraries
    from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier

    ## Initializing AdaBoost Classifier
    ada_clf = AdaBoostClassifier(
        base_estimator=None,
        n_estimators=50,
        learning_rate=1.0,
        random_state=0
    )

    ## Fitting the model
    ada_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

    ## Predicting the test set results
    y_pred_ada = ada_clf.predict(X_test)

    ## Evaluating the model
    print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_ada))

    ## Printing the confusion matrix
    print("\nConfusion Matrix:")
    print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred_ada))

    ## Printing the classification report
    print("\nClassification Report:")
    print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_ada))

    ## Printing the feature importance
    print("\nFeature Importance:")
    print(ada_clf.feature_importances_)

    ## AdaBoost Classifier Improved Model Performance

    The AdaBoost classifier is a powerful ensemble learning method that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. It builds a number of weak classifiers, each trying to correct the errors made by its predecessors, and as a result, it can improve the performance of a model.

    The AdaBoost classifier is a boosting algorithm, which means it builds a strong classifier by combining several weak classifiers. The combination is done iteratively, and the weights of the classifiers are adjusted based on the errors made by each classifier.

    The AdaBoost classifier is a good choice for both classification and regression tasks, and it can be used for both binary and multiclass classification problems.

    The AdaBoost classifier is also a good
