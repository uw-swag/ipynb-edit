The error analysis in the model is not visible in the output. This is because the model is not trained or the data is not provided for the model to make predictions. The error analysis is a feature of the DeepChecks library, which is a Python library for data analysis and visualization. It provides a way to analyze the performance of a model and identify any potential errors in the model's predictions.

The error analysis is not directly applicable to the code you provided. The error analysis is used to identify the most common errors in the model's predictions, which is not the case in the given code.
