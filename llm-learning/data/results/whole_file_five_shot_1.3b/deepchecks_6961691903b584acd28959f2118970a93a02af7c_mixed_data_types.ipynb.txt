    The commit message "[Automatic] Examples Update (#591)" suggests that the examples have been updated to reflect the changes made in the code.

    The first example checks for rare types in the 'col1' column of the DataFrame. The second example checks for rare types in the 'col2' and 'col3' columns, and rare types in the 'col4' column.

    The changes made in the code are:
    1. The 'col1' column is checked for rare types.
    2. The 'col2', 'col3' and 'col4' columns are checked for rare types.

    The changes are based on the DeepChecks library, which is a library for data quality checks in Python.
