    The code you provided is a TensorFlow 2.0 code snippet for a convolutional layer. It's a simple implementation of a convolutional layer in TensorFlow 2.0. The code defines a convolutional layer with a kernel of size 1x2, and uses the L2 loss function. The layer is then trained to perform a simple task of convolution.

    However, the code you provided is incomplete and does not provide a complete solution. It only provides the code for the convolutional layer and the training process. The training process is not shown in the code, but it is done by calling the `fit` method on the model.

    Please provide a complete solution for the problem you're facing.
