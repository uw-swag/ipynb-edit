```python
    # NBVAL_SKIP
    check = ModelInferenceTimeCheck().add_condition_inference_time_is_not_greater_than(0.00001)
    check.run(test_ds, clf)
    ```
    This code is used to check the inference time of the AdaBoost classifier. The condition is that the inference time should be less than 0.00001. If the condition is not met, the check will fail.
