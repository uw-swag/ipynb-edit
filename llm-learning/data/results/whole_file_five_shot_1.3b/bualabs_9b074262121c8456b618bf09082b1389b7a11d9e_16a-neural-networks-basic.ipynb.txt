    This notebook contains a series of cells that run all the cells in the original code. The purpose of these cells is to demonstrate the functionality of the machine learning and data analysis libraries used in the notebook. The cells are divided into different sections, each of which is designed to demonstrate a specific aspect of these libraries.

    The notebook also includes a series of tests to ensure that the functions and classes defined in the cells are working as expected. The tests are performed by calling the functions with known inputs and checking that the outputs match the expected outputs.

    The notebook also includes a series of operations to normalize the data, which is a common preprocessing step in machine learning. The operations are demonstrated by normalizing the data and checking that the mean and standard deviation of the normalized data are as expected.

    The notebook also includes a series of operations to train a model, which is a common step in machine learning. The operations are demonstrated by training a model and checking that the model's predictions match the expected outputs.

    The notebook also includes a series of operations to evaluate the model, which is a common step in machine learning. The operations are demonstrated by evaluating the model and checking that the model's performance matches the expected performance.

    The notebook also includes a series of operations to visualize the data, which is a common step in machine learning. The operations are demonstrated by visualizing the data and checking that the data is being correctly visualized.

    The notebook also includes a series of operations to perform a grid search, which is a common step in machine learning. The operations are demonstrated by performing a grid search and checking that the best parameters are being correctly identified.

    The notebook also includes a series of operations to perform a more complex operation, which is a more complex operation in machine learning. The operations are demonstrated by performing a more complex operation and checking that the result is as expected.
