    # This is a placeholder for a Python script that implements a static drift TV model.
    # The TV model is a type of time-varying (or stochastic) model that is used to model the evolution of a system over time.
    # The model is defined by a set of equations that describe the dynamics of the system.
    # The TV model is used in various fields such as signal processing, machine learning, and computer vision.

    class StaticDriftTV:

            self.state = initial_state

        def step(self, dt):
            # This method should be implemented by the subclass.
            # It should update the state of the TV model based on the current state and the time step.
            pass

        def reset(self):
            # This method should be implemented by the subclass.
            # It should reset the state of the TV model to its initial state.
            pass

        def get_state(self):
            # This method should be implemented by the subclass.
            # It should return the current state of the TV model.

        def set_state(self, new_state):

            # It should set the state of the TV model to a new value.
