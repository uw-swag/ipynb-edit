    The code you provided is a draft of a 3rd iteration of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model. The model is trained on a dataset of movie reviews, and the final accuracy of the model is evaluated on a separate test set.

    The model is a simple RNN with an Embedding layer, followed by a LSTM layer, and a Dense layer. The model is compiled with an optimizer and loss function, and the model is trained for 5 epochs. The model's performance is visualized using an interactive chart.

    The code also includes loading the IMDB dataset, preprocessing the data, and training the model. The model's performance is evaluated on the test set.

    The final interactive chart shows the model's accuracy and loss over time, which can be used to monitor the model's learning process.

    The final test loss and accuracy score are also printed, which can be used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

    The code is written in Python using the Keras and TensorFlow libraries.

    The code is divided into several cells, each of which performs a specific task. The cells are numbered to indicate their order.

    The first cell imports the necessary libraries and sets up the code checking. The next cell trains a simple RNN model on a dataset of movie reviews. The model's performance is evaluated on a separate test set.

    The code continues in the next few cells, each of which perform a specific task. The cells are numbered to indicate their order.

    The last cell prints the final interactive chart, which can be used to monitor the model's learning process.
