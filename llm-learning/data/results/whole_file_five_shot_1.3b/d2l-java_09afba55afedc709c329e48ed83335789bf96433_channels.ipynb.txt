    The code you provided is a Java code snippet for a deep learning model using the Deep Java Library (DJL). The code includes import statements, class definitions, and method implementations.

    The `corr2D` method performs a 2D cross-correlation operation on two 2D arrays. The `corr2dMultiIn` method performs a 2D cross-correlation operation on a 3D array and a 2D array. The `corrMultiInOut` method performs a 2D cross-correlation operation on a 3D array and a 4D array. The `corr2dMultiInOut1x1` method performs a 2D cross-correlation operation on a 3D array and a 4D array, and then reshapes the result to match the output shape of the fully connected layer.

    The code also includes a test case to compare the output of the `corr2dMultiInOut1x1` method with the output of the `corrMultiInOut` method.

    The code uses the Deep Java Library (DJL) to perform deep learning tasks. DJL is a machine learning library for the Java programming language that provides a simple and efficient way to build and train deep learning models.

    The code is written in a Jupyter notebook format, and it uses the PySpark library to perform distributed computing. PySpark is a Python library for Apache Spark, a big data processing engine.
