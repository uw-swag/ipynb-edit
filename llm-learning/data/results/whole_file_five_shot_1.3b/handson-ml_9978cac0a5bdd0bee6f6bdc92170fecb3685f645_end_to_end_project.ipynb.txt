    The code you provided is a mix of Python code and Jupyter notebook cells. It includes import statements, data loading, data preprocessing, and model training. However, it seems like the code is not complete and there are some missing cells.

    Here is the complete code:

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
    from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, LabelBinarizer
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
    from sklearn.externals import joblib
    from scipy.stats import geom, expon
