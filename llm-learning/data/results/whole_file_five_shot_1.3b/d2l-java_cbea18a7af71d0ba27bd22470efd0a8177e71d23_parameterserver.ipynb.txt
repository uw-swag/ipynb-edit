    ## 12.3. Introduction to the LightGCN model

    The LightGCN (Graph Convolutional Network) model is a popular choice for recommendation systems. It is a deep learning model that leverages the graph structure of the data. The model is designed to handle the large-scale, complex, and sparse data in recommendation systems.

    ## 12.4. Preparing the LightGCN model

    Before training the LightGCN model, the data needs to be preprocessed. This includes resizing the images, normalizing the pixel values, and encoding the labels. The reshape function in the previous section has been used to reshape the data into a suitable format. The LabelEncoder from sklearn has been used to encode the labels.

    ## 12.7. Training the LightGCN model

    The LightGCN model is trained using the fit method of the MLPClassifier from sklearn. The model is trained for 1000 iterations. The accuracy of the model is printed at the end of the training process.

    ## 12.8. Evaluating the LightGCN model

    The model's performance is evaluated using the precision, recall, and f1-score. The precision score measures the model's ability to not label a positive sample as positive, while the recall score measures the model's ability to find all positive samples. The f1-score is a weighted average of the precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's performance.

    ## 12.9. Making predictions

    The model can be used to make predictions on unseen data. The predict function in the model is used to make predictions. The model's prediction is printed at the end of the process.

    ## 12.10. Saving the model

    The trained model can be saved for future use. The dump function from joblib is used to save the model.

    The LightGCN model is a powerful tool for handling large-scale, complex, and sparse data in recommendation systems. It leverages the graph structure of the data, making it a suitable choice
