    The code you've provided is already in Python 3. It's already using the latest version of the Python standard library.

    However, if you want to ensure that your notebook is compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3, you can use the `from __future__` import statements at the top of your notebook. These statements are designed to help with the transition from Python 2 to Python 3.

    Here's an example:

    ```python
    from __future__ import division
    from __future__ import print_function
    from __future__ import unicode_literals
    ```

    This will help ensure that your code is compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3.

    However, please note that using `from __future__` statements is generally not recommended as it can lead to confusion and potential bugs. It's better to use the appropriate Python 3 syntax and functions.
