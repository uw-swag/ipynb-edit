# More results and EDA
# Here you can add your code to perform more results and perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# For example, you can add code to calculate the mean, median, mode, etc. of your data,
# to visualize the distribution of your data,
# to check for any missing values,
# to perform statistical tests, etc.
