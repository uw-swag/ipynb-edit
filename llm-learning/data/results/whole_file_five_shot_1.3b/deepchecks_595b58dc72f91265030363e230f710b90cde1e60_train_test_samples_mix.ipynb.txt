    from deepchecks.tabular.checks.methodology import TrainTestSamplesMix
    from deepchecks.tabular.base import Dataset

    iris = load_iris(return_X_y=False, as_frame=True)
    X = iris.data
    y = iris.target
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=55)

    train_dataset = Dataset(pd.concat([X_train, y_train], axis=1), 
                            features=iris.feature_names,
                            label='target')

    test_df = pd.concat([X_test, y_test], axis=1)
    bad_test = test_df.append(train_dataset.data.iloc[[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4]], ignore_index=True)
                    
    test_dataset = Dataset(bad_test,

    check = TrainTestSamplesMix()
    check.run(test_dataset=test_dataset, train_dataset=train_dataset)
    ```

    The code above is a simple example of how to use the Deepchecks library to perform a check on a dataset. The check is a methodology check that checks if the train and test datasets have the same number of samples. If they don't, it will raise an error.

    Please note that you need to have the Deepchecks library installed in your environment. You can install it using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install deepchecks
    ```

    Also, please note that the code above is a simple example and may not work as expected in all cases. The Deepchecks library is a powerful tool and can perform a wide range of checks, including those for time series, categ
