    The original code is a simple Python script that uses the DeepChecks library to find string mismatches in a DataFrame. The DeepChecks library is a Python library for data inspection and validation, and it provides a set of checks for data quality.

    The first cell of the script imports the necessary libraries and creates a DataFrame. The second cell uses the `StringMismatch` check to find string mismatches in the DataFrame. The `add_condition_no_variants` method is used to add a condition to the check, but it doesn't specify any variants. The `conditions_decision` method is used to decide the decision of the condition.

    The `run` method is used to execute the check on the DataFrame. The `add_condition_no_variants` method is used to add a condition to the check, but it doesn't specify any variants. The `conditions_decision` method is used to decide the decision of the condition.
