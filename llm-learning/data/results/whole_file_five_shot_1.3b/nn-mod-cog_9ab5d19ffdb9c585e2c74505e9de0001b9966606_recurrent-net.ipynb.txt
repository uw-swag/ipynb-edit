    The code you've provided is a draft of a book on deep learning, specifically focusing on the application of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to sequence prediction problems. The book is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2022.

    The book will cover the following topics:

    1. Introduction to Deep Learning
    2. Introduction to RNNs
    3. Implementing RNNs in Keras
    4. Using RNNs for sequence prediction problems
    5. Conclusion

    The book will also include practical exercises and exercises to help readers practice the concepts learned in the book.

    The book is expected to be published in the second quarter of 2022.
