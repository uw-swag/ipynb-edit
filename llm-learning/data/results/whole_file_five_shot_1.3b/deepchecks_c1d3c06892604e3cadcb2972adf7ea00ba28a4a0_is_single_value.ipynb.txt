    The code above is an example of how to use the IsSingleValue check in deepchecks, a library for data quality checks in machine learning.

    The IsSingleValue check is used to check if a column in a DataFrame has only one unique value. If a column has more than one unique value, the check will return a warning.

    The check can be used in two ways:
    1. By passing a DataFrame to the run method.
    2. By specifying a list of column names to ignore in the IsSingleValue method.

    Here is an example of how to use the IsSingleValue check:

    ```python
    sv = IsSingleValue()
    result = sv.run(df)
    print(result)
    ```

    This will return a DataFrame with a column 'check' indicating whether each column has only one unique value. If a column has more than one unique value, the 'check' column will have a value of 'False'.

    The IsSingleValue check can be used to identify columns that are likely to have errors in the data, such as columns with more than one unique value.

    The deepchecks library is a great tool for data quality checks in machine learning, and it can be used to identify and fix issues in a data set.
