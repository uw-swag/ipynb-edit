    The code you provided is a Java code snippet that uses the Deep Java Library (DJL) to perform numerical differentiation. The code also uses the Maven build system to manage dependencies, load modules, and execute code.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The code imports necessary libraries and modules.
    - The `numericalLim` function calculates the numerical limit of a function `f` at a point `x` with a step size `h`.
    - The code then uses a loop to calculate and print the numerical limit of the function `f` at the points `x=1`, `x=2`, `x=3`, and `x=4`.
    - The `plotLineAndSegment` function plots a line and a segment on the same graph.
    - The code then creates an array `X` of double values from 0 to 3 with a step size of 0.1.
    - The code calculates the values of the function `f` and the tangent line `T(x) = 2x - 3` at the points `x=1`, `x=2`, `x=3`, and `x=4`.
    - Finally, the `plotLineAndSegment` function is called with the calculated values and the tangent line as arguments, and the resulting figure is displayed.

    Please note that the code snippet is written in Java, and it uses the Maven build system to manage dependencies. The code also uses the Deep Java Library (DJL) to perform numerical differentiation.

    The code is not complete and may not work as expected. It is intended to demonstrate the use of the Maven build system, the Deep Java Library, and the numerical differentiation capabilities of the library.

    The code is also missing the necessary import statements for the `NDManager`, `Function`, and `Figure` classes. These classes are used to manage numerical data, define functions, and create plots, respectively.

    The code also lacks the necessary import statements for the `ScatterTrace`, `Layout`, `Axis`, and `Figure` classes. These classes are used to create scatter plots, layouts, axes, and figures, respectively.

    The code also lacks the
