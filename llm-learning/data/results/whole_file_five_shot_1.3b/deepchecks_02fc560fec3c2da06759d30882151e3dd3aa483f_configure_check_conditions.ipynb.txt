    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook with a mix of Python and Markdown syntax. It includes cells for importing libraries, defining functions, creating dataframes, running checks, and more.

    The first cell imports the necessary libraries and functions for the DeepChecks library. The second cell creates a dataset for training and testing. The third cell runs a check on the dataset. The fourth cell adds a custom condition to the check. The fifth cell runs the check and condition. The sixth cell defines a custom condition for the check. The seventh cell runs the check and condition. The eighth cell defines a custom condition for the check.

    The code is not complete, but it should give you a good idea of how to use the DeepChecks library to analyze your data.
