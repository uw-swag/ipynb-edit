    The code provided is a part of a larger project that involves regression analysis using PyTorch, a popular deep learning library. The code includes functions for calculating different types of regression loss functions, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and their respective error values.

    The code also includes a scatter plot of the original data points, a line plot of the predicted values, and a line plot of the absolute difference between the predicted and actual values, all in different colors.

    The MAE, MSE, and RMSE are calculated for the given data and the predicted values. The error values are then printed out.

    The code also includes a function to calculate the error of a model's predictions. This function takes the actual values and the predicted values as input, and returns the error value.
