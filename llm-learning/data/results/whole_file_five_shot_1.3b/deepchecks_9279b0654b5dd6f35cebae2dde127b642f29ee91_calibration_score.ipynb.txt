    The code you provided is a mix of Python and Cython code, which is used to perform various tasks such as data preprocessing, model training, and calibration checks. The code is divided into several cells for better readability and maintainability.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    1. The code imports necessary libraries and modules.
    2. The `custom_formatwarning` function is used to ignore all warnings except the message.
    3. The `CalibrationScore` class from the `deepchecks.checks` module is used to perform calibration checks.
    4. The `Dataset` class from the `deepchecks.base` module is used to create a dataset from a pandas DataFrame.
    5. The code reads data from URLs and preprocesses it by converting categorical features to numerical using `LabelEncoder`.
    6. The code creates a pipeline for preprocessing the data and a random forest classifier for model training.
    7. The code then calculates the calibration score for the test dataset.
    8. The code loads the iris dataset from sklearn and trains a logistic regression model.
    9. The code calculates the calibration score for the iris dataset.

    The code is divided into several cells for better readability and maintainability. Each cell contains a specific task or operation that can be executed independently.
