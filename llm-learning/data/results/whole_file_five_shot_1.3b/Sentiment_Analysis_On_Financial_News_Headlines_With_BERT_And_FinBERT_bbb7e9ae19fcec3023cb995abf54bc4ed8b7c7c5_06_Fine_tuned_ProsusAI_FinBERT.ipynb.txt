```
    # Adding files via upload
    from google.colab import files
    uploaded = files.upload()

    # Checking if the file is uploaded
    for fn in uploaded:
        print('File name:', fn)

        # Opening the file and reading its content
        with open(fn, 'r') as f:
            print(f.read())
    ```
    This code will allow you to upload files directly from your Google Colab notebook. Please note that the uploaded files will be stored in your Google Drive.
