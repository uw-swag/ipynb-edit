```
    The code you provided is for a machine learning project, specifically for optimization problems. Here's a brief explanation of the changes:

    1. The Maven dependencies for the AI libraries are updated to the latest versions.

    2. The `getRandomNormal` function is used to generate random numbers from a normal distribution.

    3. The `NDManager` is used to create and manage NDArrays.

    4. The `GradDescUtils` class is used to perform gradient descent optimization. The `showTrace2d` method is used to visualize the optimization process.

    5. The learning rate is updated in different ways: a constant learning rate, an exponential decay, and a polynomial decay.

    6. The objective function and its gradient are defined. The `train2d` method is used to train the model using gradient descent.

    Please note that the code is written in Java and uses the AI libraries for machine learning.
