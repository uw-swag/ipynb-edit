    The code you provided is a set of Jupyter notebook cells, each containing a different task or operation. Here's a brief explanation of what each cell does:

1. `<Cell_0>`: This cell imports the necessary libraries for the task.

2. `<Cell_1>`: This cell sets the plotting backend to inline, which allows the plots to be displayed directly in the notebook.

3. `<Cell_2>`: This cell reloads the `utils` module, which contains the functions used in the notebook.

4. `<Cell_3>`: This cell defines the model architecture.

5. `<Cell_4>`: This cell loads the weights of the pre-trained model.

6. `<Cell_5>`: This cell finds the index of the last convolutional layer in the model.

7. `<Cell_6>`: This cell defines a function to get the convolutional layers of the model.

8. `<Cell_7>`: This cell defines a function to get the fully connected layers of the model.

9. `<Cell_8>`: This cell gets the training and validation features.

10. `<Cell_9>`: This cell saves the training and validation features.

11. `<Cell_10>`: This cell loads the training and validation features.

12. `<Cell_11>`: This cell defines a function to get the class indices of the validation set.

13. `<Cell_12>`: This cell defines a function to get the features of the convolutional model.

14. `<Cell_13>`: This cell defines a function to get the features of the fully connected model.

15. `<Cell_14>`: This cell saves the features of the convolutional model and the features of the fully connected model.

16. `<Cell_15>`: This cell loads the features of the convolutional model and the features of the fully connected model.

17. `<Cell_16>`: This cell prints the shape of the features of the convolutional model.

18. `<Cell_17>`: This cell defines a function to process the weights of a layer.
