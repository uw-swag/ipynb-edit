    Your code is well-structured and well-organized. It includes importing necessary libraries, defining custom warnings, loading and preprocessing the data, training a model, and finally, checking the calibration score.

    However, there are a few improvements you can make:

    1. You can use the `run_checks` function to run all the checks in a single call. This can make your code cleaner and easier to read.

    2. You can use the `show` function to display the results of the checks. This can be useful for debugging and understanding the results.

    3. You can use the `save_to_file` function to save the results of the checks to a file. This can be useful for sharing the results with others.

    4. You can use the `get_score` function to get the score of the checks. This can be useful for comparing the results of different checks.

    5. You can use the `get_details` function to get the details of the checks. This can be useful for understanding the results of the checks.

    Here's how you can use these functions:

    ```python
    from deepchecks.reporting import run_checks, show, save_to_file, get_score, get_details

    # Run all checks
    result = run_checks(train_ds, model)

    # Show the results
    show(result)

    # Save the results to a file
    save_to_file(result, 'checks.html')

    # Get the score
    score = get_score(result)

    # Get the details
    details = get_details(result)
    ```

    Please note that these are just suggestions and the actual usage may vary based on your specific needs and the specifics of your project.
