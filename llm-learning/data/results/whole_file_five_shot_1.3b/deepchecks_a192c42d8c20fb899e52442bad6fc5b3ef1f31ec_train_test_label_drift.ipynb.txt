```
    The code you provided is a demonstration of how to use the DeepChecks library to perform label drift checks on a dataset. 

    The DeepChecks library is a Python library that provides a unified interface to perform checks on datasets, including label drift checks. 

    The code first creates a dataset from a random training and test data. Then, it runs a label drift check on the training dataset and the test dataset. 

    The check returns a report of the label drift statistics. 

    The code then demonstrates how to handle a situation where the test data contains a drift in the label. In this case, the code creates a new test data set where the label is increased by a random number and a small increment. 

    The code then runs a label drift check on the updated test dataset. The check returns a report of the new label drift statistics. 

    Finally, the code demonstrates how to add a condition to the label drift check to only include checks where the drift score is not greater than a certain value. 

    The DeepChecks library is a powerful tool for data quality checks and can be used to identify and fix issues in a dataset, including label drift.
