    The code you provided is a Python script that uses the Deepchecks library to create a custom check for comparing the sizes of the train and test datasets. The check is run on a dummy dataset and the results are displayed in a DataFrame and a bar graph.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The `DatasetSizeComparison` class inherits from `TrainTestBaseCheck`, which is a base class for all checks that compare the sizes of the train and test datasets.

    - The `run` method implements the check logic. It calculates the sizes of the train and test datasets and returns them as a dictionary.

    - The `result` variable holds the result of the check on the dummy datasets.

    - The `result.value` line displays the results of the check.

    - The `DatasetSizeComparison` class also has a `graph_display` function that creates a bar graph of the sizes of the train and test datasets.

    - The `DatasetSizeComparison` class is then used to run the check on the dummy datasets, and the results are displayed.

    Please note that the Deepchecks library is not installed in this environment, so you need to install it using pip:

    ```
    pip install deepchecks
    ```

    Also, please note that the code is written in Jupyter notebook format, and it uses the `%%` magic command to run Python code.
