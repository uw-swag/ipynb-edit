     "Airplanes stay in the air because their wings create lift by forcing air to move faster over the top of the wing than underneath, which creates lower pressure on top.",

     "Magnets work because they have a magnetic field that can attract or repel certain metals, like iron, due to the alignment of their atomic particles.",
     "Magnets generate a magnetic field, which can attract metals like iron by causing the electrons in those metals to align in a particular way, creating an attractive or repulsive force."],
