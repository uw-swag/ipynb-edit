    This code is a PyTorch implementation of a simple neural network for a binary classification task. The task is to classify a set of data points into two classes. The data points are represented as a tensor of shape (n, 2), where n is the number of data points. The target values are also represented as a tensor of shape (n,), where n is the number of data points.

    The code first imports the necessary libraries and defines the data points and target values. Then, it converts the target values to one-hot encoding format. The log softmax function is defined to convert the input tensor to log softmax values. The negative log likelihood (nll) function is defined to calculate the negative log likelihood of the log softmax values. The log softmax2, log softmax3, and cross entropy loss functions are defined.

    The code then calculates the log probabilities, loss, and the log softmax values for the target values. The loss is calculated using the nll function. The code also plots the log softmax values, target values, and the predicted class probabilities.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the log softmax function, log softmax2, and log softmax3. The code also demonstrates how to use the nll function.
