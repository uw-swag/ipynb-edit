```
    # Importing necessary libraries
    import dash
    import dash_core_components as dcc
    import dash_html_components as html

    # Creating the Dash app
    app = dash.Dash(__name__)

    # Adding the layout to the app
    app.layout = html.Div(children=[
        html.H1(children='Dashboard'),
        html.Div(children='This is a dashboard for the project.'),

        # Add your dashboard components here

    ])

    # Running the Dash app
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run_server(debug=True)
    ```
    This is a basic example of a Dash application. You can add your dashboard components as children to the `html.Div` in the layout.
