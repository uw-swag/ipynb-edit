    ## Chapter 4: Data Visualization with Mayavi

    ### Introduction

    In this chapter, we will explore the use of the Mayavi library in Python, which is a powerful tool for creating 3D visualizations. We will start with a simple 3D scatter plot, then move on to a 3D surface plot, and finally, a 3D Delaunay triangulation.

    ### Prerequisites

    Before starting, you should have a basic understanding of Python programming, as well as familiarity with the Mayavi library.

    ### Objectives

    The main objectives of this chapter are to:

    1. Understand the basics of 3D visualization with Mayavi.
    2. Use the Mayavi library to create 3D scatter plots.
    3. Use the Mayavi library to create 3D surface plots.
    4. Use the Mayavi library to create 3D Delaunay triangulation plots.

    ### Exercises

    After completing this chapter, you should be able to:

    1. Implement a 3D scatter plot using Mayavi.
    2. Implement a 3D surface plot using Mayavi.
    3. Implement a 3D Delaunay triangulation plot using Mayavi.

    ### Resources

    For more information, you can refer to the Mayavi documentation and other online resources.

    ### Solutions

    After completing this chapter, you should have a good understanding of how to use the Mayavi library to create 3D visualizations.
