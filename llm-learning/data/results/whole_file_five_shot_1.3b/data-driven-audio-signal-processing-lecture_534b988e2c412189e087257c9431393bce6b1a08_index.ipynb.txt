    ## Segmentation of Signals

    ## Overview
    Segmentation of signals is a crucial process in signal processing. It involves dividing a signal into different segments based on certain criteria. This can be done using various methods such as thresholding, peak detection, or even machine learning algorithms.

    ## Importing Libraries
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    ```

    ## Signal Generation
    ```python
    # Generate a simple signal
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, 1000, endpoint=False)
    signal = 100*np.sin(2*np.pi*10*t) + 50*np.sin(2*np.pi*20*t)
    ```

    ## Thresholding
    ```python
    # Thresholding is a simple method of segmenting a signal. It involves setting a certain value as the threshold and dividing the signal into two segments above and below this threshold.
    threshold = 30
    signal_above_threshold = signal[signal >= threshold]
    signal_below_threshold = signal[signal < threshold]

    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
    plt.plot(t, signal, label='Original Signal')
    plt.plot(t, signal_above_threshold, label='Signal Above Threshold')
    plt.plot(t, signal_below_threshold, label='Signal Below Threshold')
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()
    ```

    ## Peak Detection
    ```python
    # Peak detection is a more complex method of segmenting a signal. It involves finding the peak in the signal and dividing the signal into two segments above and below this peak.
    peaks, _ = find_peaks(signal, distance=10)
    signal_above_peaks = signal[peaks]
    signal_below_peaks = signal[~np.isnan(signal[~peaks])]

    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
