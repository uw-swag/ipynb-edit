    The code you've provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the PyTorch and FastAI libraries to perform image classification on the Air Pollution dataset. The notebook includes a number of cells for data loading, preprocessing, model training, model evaluation, and model submission.

    However, the code you've provided is incomplete and does not include the entirety of the notebook. It seems like the notebook is incomplete because it doesn't include the code for the model evaluation and model submission steps.

    If you want to evaluate the model and submit the predictions, you'll need to add the code for model evaluation and model submission steps.
