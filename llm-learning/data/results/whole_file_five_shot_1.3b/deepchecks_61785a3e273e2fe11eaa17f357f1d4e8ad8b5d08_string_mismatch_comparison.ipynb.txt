```python
    from mlchecks.checks import string_mismatch_comparison
    import pandas as pd

    data = {'col1': ['Deep', 'deep', 'deep!!!', 'earth', 'foo', 'bar', 'foo?']}
    compared_data = {'col1': ['Deep', 'deep', '$deeP$', 'earth', 'foo', 'bar', 'foo?', '?deep']}

    result = string_mismatch_comparison(pd.DataFrame(data=data), pd.DataFrame(data=compared_data))
    print(result)
    ```

    The function `string_mismatch_comparison` is used to compare two dataframes. It returns a list of rows where the string mismatches are found. The mismatches are defined as any string where the length of the string is less than the length of the compared string minus 1.

    The function is not a standalone function, it is a part of the mlchecks library, which is used to perform checks on machine learning models.
