    The code provided is a collection of functions and classes that are used to process and analyze EEG (Electroencephalogram) data. The main functions are:

    - `readEdfFile`: This function reads an EDF (Electroencephalogram Data File) file and returns the data as a numpy array.
    - `get_seizure_period`: This function reads a seizure file and returns the start time and length of the seizure.
    - `read_and_store_data`: This function reads EDF files from a specified directory and stores the data in a pandas DataFrame.
    - `ComputeTimeDomainFeatures`: This function computes time-domain features such as mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, standard deviation, median, zero-crossing rate, variation, root mean square, peak-to-peak, and sample entropy for a given signal.
    - `ComputeCorrelation`: This function computes the maximum absolute cross-correlation between two signals.
    - `metrics`: This function computes the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of a classification model.

    The code also uses the following libraries:
    - `pyedflib`: This library is used to read and write EDF files.
    - `pyentrp`: This library is used to compute entropy.
    - `sklearn.metrics`: This library is used to compute metrics.
    - `numpy`: This library is used for numerical computations.
    - `pandas`: This library is used for data manipulation.
    - `scipy.stats`: This library is used for statistical computations.

    The code is designed to be modular and reusable, making it easy to extend or modify.
