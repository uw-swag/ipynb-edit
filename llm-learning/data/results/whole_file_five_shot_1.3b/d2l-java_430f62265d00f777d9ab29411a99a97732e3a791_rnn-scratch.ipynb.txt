    This code is a migration of a Maven project from a local repository to a remote one. The project is a deep learning library for Java, and it includes several dependencies, such as the following:

    - `ai.djl:api:0.11.0-SNAPSHOT`: The main API of the library.
    - `ai.djl:basicdataset:0.11.0-SNAPSHOT`: A basic dataset for machine learning.
    - `ai.djl:mxnet:0.11.0-SNAPSHOT`: The MXNet engine for deep learning.
    - `ai.djl:jna:5.6.0`: JNA (Java Native Access) is a Java library for calling native code.

    The project also includes several utility classes, such as `Functions`, `PlotUtils`, `TimeMachineUtils`, `StopWatch`, `Accumulator`, `Animator`, `Training`, and `RNNModelScratch`.

    The `Functions` class is a utility class for handling device functions. The `PlotUtils` class is a utility class for plotting data. The `TimeMachineUtils` class is a utility class for loading and preprocessing time-series data.

    The `StopWatch` class is a utility class for measuring elapsed time. The `Accumulator` class is a utility class for accumulating statistics. The `Animator` class is a utility class for animating data.

    The `RNNModelScratch` class is a custom implementation of an RNN model. It includes methods for initializing the model, forwarding data, and training the model.

    Finally, the project includes a main method that trains an RNN model on a time-series dataset.

    Please note that the actual migration of the project to the remote repository may not be possible due to network issues or other reasons.
