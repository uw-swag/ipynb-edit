    The provided code is a PySpark ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for pre-processing the Yelp reviews data. The pipeline includes reading the JSON data, performing some basic transformations, and then writing the processed data to JSON and CSV formats.

    The pipeline starts with reading the JSON data from a specified location. The data is then split into a training set and a test set using an 80/20 split.

    The next step is to perform some basic transformations on the data. This includes selecting specific columns from the data, renaming some columns, and converting the data types of some columns.

    The processed data is then written to a JSON format.

    The pipeline also includes a second part of the data pre-processing, which includes selecting only the non-text data from the data. This is done by selecting specific columns from the data and filtering out the text data.

    The non-text data is then written to a CSV format.

    Finally, the test data is written to a JSON format.

    The pipeline ends with writing the training data to a JSON format.

    The pipeline is designed to be run on a local Spark cluster, with the SparkContext being the entry point to the pipeline.

    Please note that the code provided is a basic example and may need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of your project.
