    ## Feature Analysis Notebook

    This notebook will be used to analyze the features of the system. The purpose of this notebook is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the system's features, their importance, and how they contribute to the overall functionality and usability of the system.

    The features of the system will be determined based on the requirements and the design of the system. The analysis will include:

    1. **Functional Requirements**: These are the specific requirements that the system must meet to operate correctly.

    2. **Non-Functional Requirements**: These are the characteristics of the system that must be considered when evaluating its performance.

    3. **User Requirements**: These are the requirements that the end users of the system must meet to use the system effectively.

    4. **System Requirements**: These are the requirements that the system must meet to operate correctly.

    5. **Performance Requirements**: These are the requirements that the system must meet to meet its performance objectives.

    6. **Security Requirements**: These are the requirements that the system must meet to protect its assets and maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the information.

    7. **Usability Requirements**: These are the requirements that the system must meet to make it easy for users to use.

    The notebook will also include visualizations to help illustrate the features and their relationships.

    The analysis will be conducted using a combination of static analysis, dynamic analysis, and expert analysis. The results will be used to guide future development and enhancements.
