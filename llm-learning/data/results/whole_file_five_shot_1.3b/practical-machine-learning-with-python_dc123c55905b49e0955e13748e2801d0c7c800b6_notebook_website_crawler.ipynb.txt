    This code is a simple example of how to extract blog post content from a webpage using Python's requests and re libraries. The function `extract_blog_content` uses a regular expression to find the content of the blog post in the HTML content of the webpage. The content is then returned as a string.

    However, the code you provided seems to be using Git Large File Storage (LFS) for version control, which is not necessary for this task. Git LFS is a tool for versioning large files, but it's not used in this code. If you want to remove Git LFS, you can remove the import statements for `git` and `lfs`, and the corresponding code to initialize and use Git LFS.
