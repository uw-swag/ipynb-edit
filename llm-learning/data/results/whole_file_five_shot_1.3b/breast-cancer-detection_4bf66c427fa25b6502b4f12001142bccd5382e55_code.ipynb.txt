    The code provided in the commit message is a Jupyter notebook that includes a series of operations to implement an optimized XGBoost classifier for improved model performance.

    The notebook includes data loading, data exploration, data preprocessing, model training, model evaluation, and model tuning.

    The XGBoost classifier is trained on the breast cancer dataset, and the best parameters are tuned using GridSearchCV. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

    The notebook also includes a confusion matrix visualization and a classification report.

    The notebook ends with the best parameters of the tuned XGBoost model and the mean cross-validation score.
