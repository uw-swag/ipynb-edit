    ## Chapter 10: Conclusion

    In this chapter, we have explored the data of US pumpkins and analyzed the price of pumpkins based on the month. We have seen how the price of pumpkins can vary based on the month. We have also plotted a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between the price and the month.

    The conclusion of this chapter is that the price of pumpkins can vary significantly based on the month. This can be useful in various fields such as agriculture, logistics, and even in the real estate market.
