    The code you've provided is a mix of Python and Jupyter notebook code. It's using several Python libraries and packages, including pandas, numpy, sklearn, and matplotlib. It's also using the evidently library for data quality and integrity analysis.

    The code is divided into several sections, each of which is a cell in a Jupyter notebook. The first section imports the necessary libraries and packages. The next section imports the adult dataset, and then it creates two subsets: one for reference (adult_ref) and one for current (adult_cur). The next section imports the breast cancer dataset, and then it creates two subsets: one for reference (bcancer_ref) and one for current (bcancer_cur).

    The code then creates several reports, each of which is a data quality and integrity analysis of a specific dataset. The last section imports a column mapping for the breast cancer dataset, and then it creates a classification report for the adult dataset.

    The code also includes several options for data drift analysis, and a simple metric parameters for data integrity analysis.
