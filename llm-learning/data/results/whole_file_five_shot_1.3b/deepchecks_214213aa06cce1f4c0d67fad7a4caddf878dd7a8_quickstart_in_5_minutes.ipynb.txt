    ## Project: Iris Classification

    ### Overview
    This project uses the Iris dataset from the sklearn library to train a Random Forest Classifier. The Random Forest Classifier is a type of ensemble learning method, where the predictions of multiple base estimators are combined to make a final prediction.

    ### Data
    The Iris dataset is a multivariate dataset introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper. It is widely used for testing machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length and width, and petal length and width, and the species of Iris flower.

    ### Model
    The Random Forest Classifier is a type of ensemble learning method. It creates a number of decision trees at training time and output the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

    ### Evaluation
    The model is evaluated using the accuracy score, which is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions.

    ### Conclusion
    The Random Forest Classifier is a powerful and versatile machine learning algorithm. It can be used for both classification and regression tasks.
