    ## Exploration Notebook

    This notebook is designed to explore the data and the models used in the previous notebook. It will provide an overview of the data, the models used, and the results of the models.

    ### Data Overview

    The data used in this notebook is a subset of the MovieLens dataset, containing user-item interactions over a period of time. The data is preprocessed and filtered to only include users who have interacted with at least 5 movies.

    ### Models Used

    The models used in this notebook are a standard Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and a model with annealing. The annealing model is used to find the optimal hyperparameter Î².

    ### Results

    The notebook will provide an overview of the results of the models, including the NDCG@k, precision, recall, and MAP@k for different values of k.

    ### Conclusion

    The notebook concludes by plotting the NDCG@k of the models for different values of k, providing a visual comparison of the models' performance.
