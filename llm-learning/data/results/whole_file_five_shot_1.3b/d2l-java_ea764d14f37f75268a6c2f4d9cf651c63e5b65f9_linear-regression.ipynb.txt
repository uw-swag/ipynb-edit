    The code you provided seems to be a mix of Maven dependencies and Jupyter notebook cells. Here's a brief explanation of what each part of the code does:

1. Maven dependencies: These are used to manage Java libraries and dependencies. The `%maven` directives are used to add Maven dependencies to the notebook. The `<dependency>` tags are used to specify the groupId, artifactId, and version of the dependency.

2. Jupyter notebook cells: These are used to write and execute code. The `<Cell_0>` to `<Cell_5>` are used to define the cells in the notebook. The `%%loadFromPOM` directive is used to load a Maven dependency from the Maven Central Repository. The `%load` directive is used to load a Jupyter notebook file.

3. Java code: The `normal` method is a simple normal distribution function. The `combine3` method is a method that combines three arrays into one. The `combine3` method is used in the `normalDistributions` table creation and in the `LinePlot.create` method.

4. Jupyter notebook cells: These are used to create and display plots. The `Table.create`, `LinePlot.create`, and `LinePlot.create` methods are used to create a table, line plot, and scatter plot respectively. The `combine3` method is used to combine the x, y, and z arrays into one.

5. Jupyter notebook cells: These are used to perform operations on arrays. The `Arrays.fill` method is used to fill an array with a certain value. The `ArrayUtils.addAll` method is used to add all elements of an array to another array.

6. Jupyter notebook cells: These are used to perform mathematical operations on arrays. The `normal` method is used to calculate the normal distribution of a given array. The `combine3` method is used to combine the x, y, and z arrays into one.

7. Jupyter notebook cells: These are used to perform operations on arrays. The `normalDistributions` table is used to display the normal distribution of the x array. The `LinePlot.create` method
