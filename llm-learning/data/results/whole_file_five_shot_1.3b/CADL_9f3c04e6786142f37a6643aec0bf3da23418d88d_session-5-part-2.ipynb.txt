    The commit message "Bugfix: order of arguments in tf.concat" is a bug fix for the tf.concat function. The function tf.concat is used to concatenate a list of tensors into a single tensor. The order of the arguments in the function is not specified in the function's documentation, but it is consistent with the TensorFlow documentation. The bug was found in the tf.concat function's implementation, and the order of the arguments was fixed.
