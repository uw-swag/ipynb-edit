    The commit message "changed all checks to pass class to checkresult (#109)" is a change that has been made to the code to ensure that all checks have passed and the class has been assigned to the check result. This is a good practice as it helps to ensure that the checks are being performed correctly.

    The code is checking for mixed nulls in the dataframe and if found, it assigns the class to the check result.

    The checks used in this code are:
    - MixedNulls: This checks for mixed nulls in the dataframe.

    The class assigned to the check result is:
    - Pass: The checks have passed.
    - Fail: The checks have failed.

    The code is running the checks on the dataframe and assigning the class to the check result.
