    The code you provided is a section of a Jupyter notebook that includes the automatic differentiation (AD) functionality for machine learning models. The code is written in Java and uses the Deep Java Library (DJL) for automatic differentiation.

    The code includes the following sections:

    1. Importing necessary libraries and classes.
    2. Defining the batch size and whether to shuffle the training data.
    3. Creating a softmax activation function.
    4. Setting up the model, loss function, optimizer, and training configuration.
    5. Training the model on the training data.
    6. Evaluating the model on the validation data.

    Please note that the actual implementation of the code will depend on the specific requirements of your project.
