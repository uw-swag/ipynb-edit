```python
    from sklearn import svm

    # Create a SVM Classifier
    clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear') 

    # Train the model using the training sets
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Predict the response for test dataset
    y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

    # Model Accuracy: how often is the classifier correct?
    from sklearn import metrics
    print("Accuracy:", metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
    ```
