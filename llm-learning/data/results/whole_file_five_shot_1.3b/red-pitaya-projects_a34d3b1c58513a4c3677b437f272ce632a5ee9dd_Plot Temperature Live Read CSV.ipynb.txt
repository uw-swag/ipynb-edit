The code you've provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses Matplotlib to animate a line graph of temperature data. The notebook reads temperature data from a CSV file, appends the data to a DataFrame, and then updates the graph with the new data.

The code is divided into three main sections:

1. The first section imports necessary libraries and sets up the data file.
2. The second section reads the data from the CSV file and appends it to a DataFrame.
3. The third section defines a function `animate` that is called every 2 seconds. This function appends a new temperature reading to the DataFrame, updates the graph, and then clears the output.

The notebook also includes a call to `df.to_csv(filename,names=headers)` to save the updated DataFrame back to the CSV file.

Please note that the code assumes that the `xadc_get_value_temp` function is available and returns a list of temperature readings. If this is not the case, you will need to replace `xadc_get_value_temp` with the appropriate function call.
