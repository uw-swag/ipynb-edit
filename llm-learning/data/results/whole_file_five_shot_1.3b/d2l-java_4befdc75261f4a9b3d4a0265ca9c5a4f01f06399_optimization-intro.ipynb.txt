    ## 1. Introduction

    ### 1.1 Overview
    This notebook provides an introduction to optimization and deep learning. It is a part of the course "11.1 Optimization and Deep Learning" offered by the University of Colorado Boulder.

    ### 1.2 Objectives
    The main objectives of this notebook are to provide a comprehensive understanding of optimization and deep learning, and to apply these concepts in practical applications.

    ### 1.3 Requirements
    This notebook requires a basic understanding of Python, and familiarity with libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.

    ## 2. Optimization

    ### 2.1 Gradient Descent
    Gradient descent is a method used to minimize a function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient.

    ### 2.2 Stochastic Gradient Descent
    Stochastic gradient descent is a variant of gradient descent where the direction of the gradient is chosen randomly.

    ### 2.3 Mini-Batch Gradient Descent
    Mini-batch gradient descent is a variant of gradient descent where the gradient is computed on a random subset of the training data.

    ### 2.4 Learning Rate Schedules
    Learning rate schedules are used to adjust the learning rate during training. There are different types of learning rate schedules, such as exponential decay, polynomial decay, and step decay.

    ### 2.5 Regularization
    Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models. There are different types of regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, and early stopping.

    ### 2.6 Optimizers
    Optimizers are used to update the model parameters in the direction that minimizes the loss function. There are different types of optimizers, such as SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Nadam.

    ## 3. Deep Learning

    ### 3.1 Convolutional Neural Networks
    Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models used for image processing. They are particularly effective at processing spatial data.
