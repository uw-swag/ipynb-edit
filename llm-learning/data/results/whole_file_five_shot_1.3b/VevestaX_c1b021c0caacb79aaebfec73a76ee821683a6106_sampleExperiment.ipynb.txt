The code you've provided is a sample of how to use the vevesta library in Python to perform an experiment. The code reads a CSV file, extracts some features, performs some feature engineering, starts and ends a tracking of some variables, and then dumps the data to an Excel file.

The code is divided into several cells, each of which performs a specific task. The first cell imports the vevesta library and creates an instance of the Experiment class. The next cell reads a CSV file and assigns it to a pandas DataFrame. The next cell extracts the column names for the features. The next cell performs some feature engineering on the DataFrame. The next cell starts tracking of some variables. The next cell ends tracking of the variables. The last cell dumps the data to an Excel file.

The code is not complete and there are some missing cells. The missing cells are:

- The cell where the features are printed.
- The cell where the features engineered are printed.
- The cell where the variables tracked are ended.
- The cell where the data is dumped to an Excel file.
- The cell where the data is read from the Excel file.

Please provide the complete code and I'll be happy to help you fix it.
