    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that includes a series of operations on a dataset, including loading data, cleaning, and analyzing it. The notebook also includes some data visualization and manipulation operations.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    1. The first part of the notebook imports necessary libraries and sets some options.

    2. The next part loads the data from the .pkl files.

    3. The data is then converted into a pandas DataFrame.

    4. The next few cells define some conditions for filtering the users.

    5. The next few cells filter the users based on the conditions defined in the previous cells.

    6. The next few cells calculate the number of users for each condition.

    7. The next few cells calculate the number of users for each condition and display the results.

    8. The next few cells calculate the number of users for each condition and display the results.

    9. The next few cells calculate the number of users for each condition and display the results.

    10. The next few cells calculate the number of users for each condition and display the results.

    11. The next few cells calculate the number of users for each condition and display the results.

    12. The next few cells calculate the number of users for each condition and display the results.

    13. The next few cells calculate the number of users for each condition and display the results.

    14. The next few cells calculate the number of users for each condition and display the results.

    15. The next few cells calculate the number of users for each condition and display the results.

    16. The next few cells calculate the number of users for each condition and display the results.

    17. The next few cells calculate the number of users for each condition and display the results.
