    [Automatic] Examples Update (#535)

    The commit includes examples of how to use the Deepchecks library to compare the performance of different models.

    The first example uses the RandomModelComparison check, which compares the performance of a model with a random model.

    The second example uses the ConstantModelComparison check, which compares the performance of a model with a model that always predicts the same class.

    The third example uses the TreeModelComparison check, which compares the performance of a model with a model that predicts the class with a certain gain.

    The fourth example uses the TreeModelComparison check with a condition that the gain of the tree model must be greater than 0.2.

    The code also includes a comment explaining the purpose of the commit.

    The commit also includes a link to the Deepchecks documentation, which provides more information about the checks and how to use them.

    The commit also includes a link to the Deepchecks GitHub repository, which is a good place to contribute to the Deepchecks project.

    The commit also includes a link to the Deepchecks PyPI page, which is a good place to install the Deepchecks library.
