    ## Implementing code changes for improved model performance

    ## 1. Feature Scaling
    # Standardizing the features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance is a common requirement for many machine learning estimators implemented in scikit-learn, including those that use the covariance matrix or kernel trick.

    ## 2. Tuning hyperparameters
    # Hyperparameters are parameters whose values are set before training. For example, in SVM, the parameters are C, gamma, kernel, etc.

    ## 3. Model Selection
    # Choosing the right model is a crucial step in model selection. You can use techniques like cross-validation, grid search, or random search to find the best model.

    ## 4. Regularization
    # Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting. It involves adding a penalty term to the loss function of a learning algorithm.

    ## 5. Ensemble Methods
    # Ensemble methods are a powerful machine learning technique that combine the predictions of several base estimators to improve generalizability and robustness.

    ## 6. Pruning
    # Pruning is a process in which you remove or "prune" the branches of a decision tree to reduce the complexity of the model.

    ## 7. Bagging
    # Bagging is a method of reducing the variance of a machine learning algorithm by creating multiple models from a single model.

    ## 8. Boosting
    # Boosting is a method of reducing the variance of a machine learning algorithm by creating multiple models from a single model.

    ## 9. Feature Selection
    # Feature selection is a process that is used to find the most relevant features for a given task.

    ## 10. Feature Extraction
    # Feature extraction is a process that involves selecting a subset of the most important features from the original dataset.

    ## 11. Feature Engineering
    # Feature engineering is a process that involves creating new features from existing features.

    ## 12. Model Evaluation
    # Model evaluation is a process of comparing the predicted values of a model with the actual values.

    ## 13. Model Interpretability
    # Model interpretability is a process
