    The code you provided is a simple example of using the Red Pitaya FPGA's oscillator (oscillator) module in Python. The code is designed to trigger an oscillator and then plot the data from the buffer.

    However, the code is not actually modifying any files or removing any unchanged example files. It's just setting up the environment, creating an oscillator, and triggering and plotting the data.

    If you want to remove the unchanged example files, you would need to create a new Python script or modify the existing one to remove the code you've shown.

    If you want to remove the example files, you would need to delete the files in the Red Pitaya's file system. The files are typically located in the directory `/home/user/redpitaya/examples/`.

    If you want to modify the example files, you would need to edit the files in the Red Pitaya's file system.

    Please note that modifying or removing files can have significant effects on your Red Pitaya's hardware and software. It's important to backup your data before making any changes.

    If you're not sure about any of these, you should consult the Red Pitaya's documentation or the user's guide.
