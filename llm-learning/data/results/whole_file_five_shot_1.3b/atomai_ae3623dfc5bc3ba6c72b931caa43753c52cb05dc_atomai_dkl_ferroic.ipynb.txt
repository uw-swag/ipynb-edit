    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the AtomAI library to perform a specific task. AtomAI is a Python library for atomistic simulations. The task is to perform a specific analysis on a dataset from a scientific experiment.

    The notebook starts with installing the AtomAI library and then loads a dataset from a specific experiment. It then performs some basic data analysis and visualization.

    The notebook then loads a specific dataset from the AtomAI library and performs some operations on it. The operations include extracting subimages from the main image, calculating the polarization values for each image, and training a DKL-GPR model on the data.

    The notebook also includes code to split the data into training and testing sets, and to train the DKL-GPR model on the training set and make predictions on the testing set.

    Finally, the notebook includes code to visualize the results of the analysis.

    The notebook is designed to be interactive and allows the user to adjust the parameters of the analysis and the model, and to animate the results of the analysis.

    The notebook is a good example of how to use the AtomAI library to perform complex data analysis tasks.
