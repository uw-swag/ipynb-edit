    The commit message "[Automatic] Examples Update (#534)" suggests that the examples have been updated. 

    The original code cells are not provided, but I can see that they are using the deepchecks library to perform a check on the dataset. 

    The check is a methodology check that looks for leakage in the identifier column 'x1'. The check is run on the dataset.

    The updated code cells are using the deepchecks library to perform a check on the dataset.
