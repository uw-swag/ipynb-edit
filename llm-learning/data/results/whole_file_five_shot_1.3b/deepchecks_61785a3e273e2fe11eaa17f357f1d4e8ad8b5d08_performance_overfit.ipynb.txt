    The function `train_validation_difference_overfit` is used to check the difference between the training and validation set performance. If the difference is overfitting, it will return a warning message.

    The function `TrainValidationDifferenceOverfit` is a class that wraps the function `train_validation_difference_overfit`. It has a method `run` that can be used to run the function with different alternative metrics.

    The function `train_validation_difference_overfit` takes three arguments:

    - `train_ds`: A dataset object containing the training data.
    - `val_ds`: A dataset object containing the validation data.
    - `clf`: A classifier object.

    The function has an optional parameter `alternative_metrics`. This parameter should be a dictionary where the keys are the names of the metrics and the values are the functions that will be used to calculate the metrics.

    The function returns the difference between the performance of the classifier on the training set and the validation set. If the difference is overfitting, it will return a warning message.
