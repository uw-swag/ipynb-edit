```python
    # Assignment Problem Statement:
    # Create a Python program that calculates the area of a rectangle.

    # Problem Statement:
    # Write a Python program that prompts the user to input the length and width of a rectangle. The program should then calculate and print the area of the rectangle.

    # Example:
    # If the user inputs 5 for the length and 10 for the width, the program should print: "The area of the rectangle is 50"

    # Hint: You can use the `input()` function to get the user's input, and the `print()` function to output the result.

    # Solution:
    # Here is a Python program that solves the problem:

    # Get the length and width of the rectangle from the user
    length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
    width = float(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))

    # Calculate the area of the rectangle
    area = length * width

    # Print the result
    print("The area of the rectangle is", area)
    ```
