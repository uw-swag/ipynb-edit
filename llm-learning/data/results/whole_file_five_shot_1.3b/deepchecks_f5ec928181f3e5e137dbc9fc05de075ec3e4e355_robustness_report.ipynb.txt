    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook. It's used to load a dataset, train a model, and then generate a robustness report.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The first part of the code is importing necessary libraries and loading the MNIST dataset.

    - The second part of the code is creating a model. In this case, a simple model is used, but you can replace it with any other model.

    - The third part of the code is creating a robustness report. This report will give you a summary of the model's performance on the MNIST dataset.

    - The fourth part of the code is running the robustness report.

    - The last part of the code is running the robustness report with a condition that only considers predictions with a robustness score greater than 0.05.

    The `result.show(show_additional_outputs=False)` line is used to display the robustness report. The `show_additional_outputs=False` argument is used to hide the additional outputs that the `show` function generates.

    Please note that the code assumes that you have the necessary libraries installed and the MNIST dataset is available.
