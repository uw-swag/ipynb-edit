```
    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses TensorFlow to train a model to classify news articles into categories. The model is trained on the Reuters dataset, which consists of 10000 training examples and 1000 test examples. The model is trained for 20 epochs and the training and test loss are logged at every 20 epoch. The model's performance is evaluated on the test set. The code also includes a function to shuffle the data, a function to create a polynomial features, and a function to train the model.

    The code is divided into several cells for better readability and maintainability. The first cell imports the necessary libraries and modules. The next cell loads the Reuters dataset and defines the maximum degree of the polynomial features. The next cell defines the training and test dataset sizes. The next cell defines the number of epochs and the log interval. The next cell defines the loss labels. The next cell defines the training and test loss arrays. The next cell defines the epoch count array. The next cell defines the training function. The next cell defines the test function. The next cell defines the loss label array. The next cell defines the data for the line plot. The next cell defines the layout for the line plot. The next cell renders the line plot.

    The code is a good example of how to use TensorFlow to train a model for text classification.
