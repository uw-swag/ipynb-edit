    The documentation for the `DatasetSizeComparison` check has been updated to include a new section for displaying the comparison of the sizes of the train and test datasets. The new section includes a bar graph that displays the sizes of the train and test datasets.

    The `run` method of the `DatasetSizeComparison` check now also returns a `display` function that can be used to display the comparison of the sizes of the train and test datasets.

    The `display` function uses matplotlib to create a bar graph that displays the sizes of the train and test datasets.
