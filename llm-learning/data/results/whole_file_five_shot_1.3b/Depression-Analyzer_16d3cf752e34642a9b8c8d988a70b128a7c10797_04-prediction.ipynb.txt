    You can add files via the "Upload" option in the "Files" tab in the Jupyter notebook.

    Here's how to do it:

    1. Click on the "Files" tab in the Jupyter notebook.
    2. Click on the "Upload" button.
    3. Choose the file you want to add.
    4. Click on the "Upload" button again.

    After the file is uploaded, you can run the code in the cell below it.

    Please note that the file should be in the same directory as your notebook.

    Also, the file should be a Python script (.py) or a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) file.
