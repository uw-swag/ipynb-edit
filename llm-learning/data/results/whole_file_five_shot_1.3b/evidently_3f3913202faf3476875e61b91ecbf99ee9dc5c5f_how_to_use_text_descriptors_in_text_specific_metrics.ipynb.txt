    The function `text_feature_descriptors` takes a string of text as input and returns a dictionary of descriptors. The descriptors are derived from the `textblob` library.

    The function uses the `TextBlob` class from `textblob` to process the text. The descriptors are then returned as a dictionary.

    The descriptors include:
    - `word_count`: the number of words in the text
    - `sentence_count`: the number of sentences in the text
    - `avg_sentence_length`: the average length of sentences in the text
    - `avg_syllables_per_word`: the average number of syllables per word in the text
    - `polarity`: the polarity of the text (between -1 and 1)
    - `subjectivity`: the subjectivity of the text (between 0 and 1)

    The function is then tested with a simple string.
