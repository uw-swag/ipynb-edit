```
    # Update the dataset
    train_ds = dataset_from_dict({'col1': [1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11]}, 'col1')
    test_ds = dataset_from_dict({'col1': [4, 3, 5, 6, 7]}, 'col1')

    # Run the check
    check_obj.run(train_ds, test_ds)
    ```
    The code above is an example of how to update a dataset and run a check. The check is a simple check that checks for leakage in the training and test sets.
