    The code provided is a machine learning project that involves predicting the user based on the features provided in the dataset. The project uses various machine learning algorithms to predict the user based on the provided features. The code also includes visualizations to help understand the performance of the models. The final part of the code is a prediction of the user based on the features of the 'Who Is?' dataset.

    The code also includes a function to evaluate the performance of the models and select the best one. The performance metric used for evaluation is the accuracy score. The code also includes a function to display the points in a 2D plot to visualize the classification of the data.

    The final part of the code is a prediction of the user based on the features of the 'Who Is?' dataset. The prediction is based on the most common class in the 'Who Is?' dataset.
