    The commit message "0.4.0 version bump ðŸš€ (#766)" indicates a major version bump. This could be a release of a new feature, a bug fix, or a new feature that is not backward compatible with previous versions.

    The code cells are related to the DeepChecks library, which is a library for data integrity checks. The first cell imports the necessary libraries and creates a DataFrame with some test data. The second cell runs a check on the DataFrame to find outliers in the "col1" column. The third cell creates a new DataFrame with some outliers in the "col1" column, and then runs a check on this DataFrame to find outliers in the "col1" column.

    The check in the second cell is a StringLengthOutOfBounds check, which checks if the length of the strings in the "col1" column is out of bounds. The check in the third cell is a StringLengthOutOfBounds check with a larger number of percentiles and a larger number of unique values.

    The version bump is a good practice as it not only makes the release more clear but also ensures that the library is compatible with future changes.
