    ## CPU vs GPU in Training Deep Neural Networks

    Deep learning models, including neural networks, are computationally intensive tasks. Training a model involves a lot of computations, which can be a time-consuming process on a CPU. On the other hand, GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are designed to perform these computations more efficiently.

    Here's a comparison of CPU and GPU-based training:

    **CPU-based Training:**

    - **Speed:** CPUs are faster than GPUs. This is because CPUs are designed to perform operations at a very high speed.
    - **Power Consumption:** CPUs are much less power-efficient than GPUs. They require less power to run, which can be a significant advantage in a low-power system.
    - **Parallelism:** CPUs can process multiple tasks simultaneously, which is not possible with GPUs.

    **GPU-based Training:**

    - **Speed:** GPUs are slower than CPUs. This is because GPUs are designed to perform operations at a very low speed.
    - **Power Consumption:** GPUs are much more power-efficient than CPUs. They require more power to run, which can be a significant disadvantage in a high-power system.
    - **Parallelism:** GPUs can process multiple tasks simultaneously, which is possible with CPUs.

    In summary, if you're working on a system with limited power, you might want to use a GPU. If you're working on a system with limited processing power, you might want to use a CPU. If you're working on a system with both limited power and processing power, you might want to use a hybrid approach, such as a CPU and a GPU.
