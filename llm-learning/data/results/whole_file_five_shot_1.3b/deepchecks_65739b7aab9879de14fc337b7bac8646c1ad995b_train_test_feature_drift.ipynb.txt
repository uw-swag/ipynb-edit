    The commit message "links-checks github action fix (#775)" is a fix for a GitHub action. The action is used to run checks on the codebase, and it's used to ensure that the codebase is clean, well-documented, and follows the best practices.

    The code cells provided are part of a larger workflow that is used to automate the testing and validation of the codebase. The workflow includes:

    1. Generating random data for training and testing.
    2. Preprocessing the data to ensure it's in the correct format.
    3. Training a model using the preprocessed data.
    4. Evaluating the model using a check.
    5. Adding a condition to the check to ensure that the PSI (Performance Measure of Spatial Intelligence) score is not greater than a certain value and the Earth Mover's Distance score is not greater than a certain value.

    The `deepchecks` library is used to perform these checks. The `TrainTestFeatureDrift` check is used to check the feature drift in the training and test datasets.

    The `run` method of the `TrainTestFeatureDrift` check is used to perform the check. The `show` method is used to display the results of the check.

    The `add_condition_drift_score_not_greater_than` method is used to add a condition to the check. This condition ensures that the PSI score is not greater than a certain value and the Earth Mover's Distance score is not greater than a certain value.

    The `run` method of the check with the added condition is used to perform the check. The `show` method is used to display the results of the check.
