    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that includes several steps to preprocess and clean the data. Here's a brief overview of what each section does:

    1. **Import necessary libraries**: This section imports the necessary libraries for data manipulation and analysis.

    2. **Load and explore the data**: This section reads the data from a CSV file and prints the shape of the dataframe. It also prints the first few rows of the dataframe.

    3. **Check for missing values**: This section checks for missing values in the dataframe.

    4. **Convert all the values to lowercase**: This section converts all the values in the dataframe to lowercase.

    5. **Split the 'price' column**: This section splits the 'price' column into multiple columns based on the price values.

    6. **Handle 'price' values**: This section handles the 'price' values by converting the values to a numeric format.

    7. **Categorize 'agePossession' values**: This section categorizes the 'agePossession' values based on their age.

    8. **Handle 'nearbyLocations' values**: This section handles the 'nearbyLocations' values by converting them into a list.

    9. **Scale the 'furnishDetails' values**: This section scales the 'furnishDetails' values using StandardScaler.

    10. **Perform KMeans clustering**: This section performs KMeans clustering on the scaled 'furnishDetails' values and assigns each row to a cluster.

    11. **Plot the results**: This section plots the WCSS (Within Cluster Sum) values to find the optimal number of clusters.

    12. **Predict the cluster assignments**: This section predicts the cluster assignments for each row.

    13. **Add the cluster assignments to the dataframe**: This section adds the cluster assignments to the original dataframe.

    14. **Drop unnecessary columns**: This section drops unnecessary columns from the dataframe.

    15. **Save the cleaned dataframe**: This section saves the cleaned dataframe to a CSV file.
