    The code provided is used to calculate the correlation between the predicted values and the actual values. The correlation is calculated using Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall's Tau correlation coefficients. The correlation values are then displayed in a heatmap.

    The heatmap displays the correlation between the predicted values and the actual values for different age groups. The color of each cell represents the correlation coefficient. The darker the color, the stronger the correlation.

    The code also calculates the accuracy and mean squared error of the model for different age groups.

    The code also calculates the correlation between different age groups and the predicted values.

    The code is used to compare the performance of different models for different age groups.
