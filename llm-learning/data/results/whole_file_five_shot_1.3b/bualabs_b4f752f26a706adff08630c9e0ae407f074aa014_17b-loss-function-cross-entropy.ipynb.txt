The chart section in the provided code is used to visualize the log-probabilities and loss for different models. The log-probabilities are calculated using the softmax function, and the loss is calculated using the negative log of the log-probabilities. The chart shows the loss and log-probabilities for each epoch, which can be used to monitor the training process.
