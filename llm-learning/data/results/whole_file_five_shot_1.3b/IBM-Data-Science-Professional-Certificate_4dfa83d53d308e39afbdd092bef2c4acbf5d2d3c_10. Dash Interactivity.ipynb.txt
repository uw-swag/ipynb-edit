    The code you provided is a Dash application that allows users to select a year from a dropdown menu, and then displays a line plot of the average arrival delay time for flights in that year.

    The application is set up to run in the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block, which means that if the script is run directly, it will start the server and open a web browser window.

    The `app.layout` is a layout for the dashboard. It includes a title, a dropdown menu for selecting a year, and a line plot of the average arrival delay time for flights in that year.

    The `app.callback` function is a callback that is triggered when the value of the dropdown menu changes. It computes the average arrival delay time for flights in the selected year and updates the line plot accordingly.

    The `get_graph` function is a callback function that is triggered when the value of the dropdown menu changes. It computes the average arrival delay time for flights in the selected year and returns a line plot of the data.

    The `dcc.Graph` component is used to display the line plot.

    The `app.run_server()` function starts the server and opens the dashboard in a web browser.

    The code is written in Python and uses the Dash library, which is a Python framework for building analytical web applications.
