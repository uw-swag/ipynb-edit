The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that includes several cells. Here's a brief explanation of what each cell does:

1. `<Cell_0>`: This cell installs the `atomai` library, which is used for image processing tasks.

2. `<Cell_1>`: This cell imports the necessary functions and classes from the `atomai` library.

3. `<Cell_2>`: This cell downloads an image with coordinates and loads it into a NumPy array.

4. `<Cell_3>`: This cell creates a mask for the image based on the coordinates.

5. `<Cell_4>`: This cell combines the masks for both atoms A and B. If there are multiple classes, it also creates a background class.

6. `<Cell_5>`: This cell extracts patches from the image and labels from the masks.

7. `<Cell_6>`: This cell applies various image distortion and augmentation techniques to the images.

8. `<Cell_7>`: This cell displays the augmented images and their corresponding labels.

9. `<Cell_8>`: This cell splits the data into training and testing sets.

10. `<Cell_9>`: This cell mounts the Google Drive to allow for file uploads and downloads.

11. `<Cell_10>`: This cell saves the augmented data to a .npz file.

The code you provided is a good example of how to use the `atomai` library for image processing tasks.
