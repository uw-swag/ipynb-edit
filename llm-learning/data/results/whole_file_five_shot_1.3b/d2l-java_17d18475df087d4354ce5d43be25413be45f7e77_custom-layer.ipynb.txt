    The code you provided is a Maven configuration for a project that uses the AI Deep Learning library (D2L) Java. The project is using the following dependencies:

    - ai.djl:api:0.7.0-SNAPSHOT: The AI Deep Learning API, which provides the core functionalities of the library.
    - ai.djl:model-zoo:0.7.0-SNAPSHOT: The model zoo, which contains pre-trained models for various tasks.
    - org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.26: The SLF4J API, which is used for logging.
    - org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:1.7.26: The SLF4J Simple, which is a simple implementation of the SLF4J API.
    - net.java.dev.jna:jna:5.3.0: JNA, which is a Java Native Access API, which allows Java programs to call native code.
    - ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-engine:0.7.0-SNAPSHOT: The MXNet engine, which is a deep learning framework that supports a wide range of neural network architectures.
    - ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-native-auto:1.7.0-a: The MXNet native auto, which is a native-based version of MXNet.

    The project also defines a custom block `CenteredLayer` that subtracts the mean of its input. It also defines a custom block `MyLinear` that applies a linear transformation and a ReLU activation.
