    The code you provided is a Python script for a classification problem using the Adult dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The script imports necessary libraries, reads the dataset, and encodes categorical features. It then checks the drift of the dataset using the WholeDatasetDrift check.

    The code seems to be correct, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

    1. The code seems to be missing the part where the model is trained and evaluated.
    2. The code does not include any part where the model is tested on the test dataset.
    3. The code does not include any part where the model's performance is evaluated.

    Please provide the missing parts of the code so that I can help you better.
