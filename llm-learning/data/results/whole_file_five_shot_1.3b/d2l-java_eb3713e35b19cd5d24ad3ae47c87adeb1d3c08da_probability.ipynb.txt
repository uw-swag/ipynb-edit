    # Section 2.6: Probability
    # ------------------------

    # Probability is a fundamental concept in machine learning and statistics. It's the likelihood of an event occurring.
    # In the context of machine learning, probability is used to measure the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

    # Probability Distribution
    # ------------------------

    # A probability distribution is a function that assigns a probability to each possible outcome of a random variable.
    # For example, a fair coin flip has a probability distribution that assigns a 0.5 probability to either heads or tails.

    # Probability Mass Function (PMF)
    # -------------------------------

    # The Probability Mass Function (PMF) of a discrete random variable X is defined as:
    # P(X = k) = f(k) for all k
    # where f(k) is the probability mass function of X at value k.

    # Conditional Probability
    # ------------------------

    # The conditional probability P(X|Y) of an event Y occurring given an event X has the following formula:
    # P(X|Y) = P(X ∩ Y) / P(Y)
    # where P(X ∩ Y) is the intersection of the probability of X and Y, and P(Y) is the probability of Y.

    # Bayes' Theorem
    # --------------

    # Bayes' theorem is a fundamental theorem in probability theory and statistics that provides a way to update the probability of an event
    # given evidence. It's often used in machine learning to update the model's parameters.

    # Bayes' Rule
    # -----------

    # Bayes' Rule is a way to update the probability of an event given evidence. It's represented as:
    # P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
    # where P(A|B) is the probability of event A given B, P(B|A) is the probability of B given A, P(A) is the probability of A,
    # and P(B) is the probability of B.
