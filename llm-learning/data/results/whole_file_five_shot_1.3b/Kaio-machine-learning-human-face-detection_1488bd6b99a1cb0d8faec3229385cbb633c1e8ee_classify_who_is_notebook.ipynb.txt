    The commit message "Treinamento com 10 usuários finalizado, falta mais 2 usuários para fechar o treinamento" indicates that the training process has finished and there are more users to be trained. 

    The code cells in the commit message are related to the training of a machine learning model using the MNIST dataset, which is a dataset of 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits. The model is trained to recognize the digit it has been trained on.

    The code also imports necessary libraries for data processing, machine learning, and visualization. The function `display_features` is used to visualize the distribution of features in the dataset. The function `model_1` to `model_14` are used to train different machine learning models on the dataset. The function `performance_metric` is used to evaluate the performance of the models. The function `plot` is used to visualize the confusion matrix. The function `get_who_is` is used to get the data for the who_is prediction.

    The code also uses a switcher to classify the prediction of the model based on the predicted digit. The final print statement shows the classification of the prediction based on the model's performance.

    The commit message also mentions that the model has a precision of 55% in the real world, and an accuracy of 92.5% in the test set. This indicates that the model is able to accurately classify the digits in the real world.

    The code also uses a confusion matrix to visualize the performance of the model. The confusion matrix shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

    The code also uses a dictionary to map the predicted digit to a string representation, which is then printed out.
