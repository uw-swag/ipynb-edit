    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the evidently library to create dashboards for regression and data drift monitoring. The dashboards are created using the `Dashboard` class from the evidently library. The dashboards are then displayed using the `show` method.

    The dashboards are created for the reference data and the current data. The reference data is used to train the regression model, and the current data is used to calculate the regression performance and the target drift.

    The dashboards are then saved to HTML files using the `save` method.

    The code also calculates the data drift and target drift for the current data.

    The dashboards are created for the reference data and the current data for different time periods.

    The code is not complete and there are some missing cells. The missing cells are:

    1. The code to calculate the data drift and target drift for the current data.
    2. The code to save the dashboards to HTML files.
