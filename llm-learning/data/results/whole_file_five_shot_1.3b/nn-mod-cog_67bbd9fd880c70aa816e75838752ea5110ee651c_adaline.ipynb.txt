    ADALINE (Adaptive Linear Neuron) is a type of linear model used in machine learning. It is a simple model that is used for binary classification problems. The model is based on the idea that the weights of the model can be adjusted based on the error of the prediction.

    The ADALINE algorithm is a simple model and is not suitable for large datasets. It is also not suitable for high dimensional data.

    Limitations:
    1. ADALINE is not suitable for large datasets.
    2. It is not suitable for high dimensional data.
    3. It is not suitable for multi-class classification problems.
    4. It is not suitable for regression problems.
    5. It is not suitable for neural networks.
    6. It is not suitable for text classification problems.
    7. It is not suitable for time series classification problems.
    8. It is not suitable for complex models.
    9. It is not suitable for models with non-linear decision boundaries.
    10. It is not suitable for models with high dimensional data.
