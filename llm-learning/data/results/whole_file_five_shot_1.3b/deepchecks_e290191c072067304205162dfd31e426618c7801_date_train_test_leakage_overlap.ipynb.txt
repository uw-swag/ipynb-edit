    The code provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook and it's used to demonstrate the use of Deepchecks library to detect leakage in a dataset. The code is written in Python and it uses the Deepchecks library to perform data quality checks.

    The code first creates two datasets, `train_ds` and `test_ds`, which are used to train and test a model, respectively. The `DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap` check is then run on these datasets to detect any potential leakage.

    The code is a part of a larger pipeline and it's used to demonstrate how to use Deepchecks to detect and handle potential leakage in a dataset.

    The code is not executable and it's a demonstration of how to use Deepchecks to detect and handle potential leakage in a dataset.
