    The code provided is a test suite for the evidently library, which is used for data quality checks. The tests are run on the 'adult' dataset, and the null values are replaced with random numbers. The tests include:

    1. TestValueQuantile: This test checks if the 'education-num' column has values that are greater than the specified quantile.
    2. TestFeatureValueMin: This test checks if the 'age', 'fnlwgt', and 'education-num' columns have values that are greater than 0.
    3. TestColumnNANShare: This test checks if the 'education-num' column has values that are greater than 0.5.
    4. TestFeatureValueMin: This test checks if the 'age', 'fnlwgt', and 'education-num' columns have values that are greater than 0.

    The tests are run on the current and reference data, and the results are displayed.
