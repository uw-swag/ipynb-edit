    The code you provided is for creating a test suite for a machine learning dataset. The test suite is used to evaluate the quality of the dataset, including the number of columns, rows, constant columns, duplicated columns, duplicated rows, column types, target features correlation, highly correlated features, share of drifted features, number of drifted features, and feature value drift.

    However, the code you provided is not complete. It seems like you want to add visualizations for the metrics. This can be done using libraries like matplotlib or seaborn in Python. Here's an example of how you can add a bar plot for the number of rows:

    ```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Count the number of rows
    num_rows = df.shape[0]

    # Create a bar plot
    plt.bar(1, num_rows)
    plt.ylabel('Number of Rows')
    plt.show()
    ```

    This code will create a bar plot with the number of rows on the y-axis and the label 'Number of Rows' on the x-axis. The plot will be displayed with `plt.show()`.

    Please note that you need to replace `df` with your actual DataFrame.

    Also, you need to install the necessary libraries if you haven't done so. You can install them using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib pandas numpy sklearn evidently
    ```

    This code is a simple example and might not work as expected with your actual DataFrame. You might need to adjust it according to your needs.
