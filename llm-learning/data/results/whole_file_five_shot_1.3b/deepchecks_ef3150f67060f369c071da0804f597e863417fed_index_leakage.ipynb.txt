    The code you provided is a demonstration of how to use the `IndexTrainTestLeakage` check in the `deepchecks` library. This check is used to detect if the index used in the training dataset is present in the test dataset.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The `dataset_from_dict` function is used to create a `Dataset` object from a dictionary.
    - The `IndexTrainTestLeakage` check is then used to run the check on the two datasets.

    The `IndexTrainTestLeakage` check has two optional parameters:

    - `n_index_to_show`: This parameter determines how many index values to show in the check result. If this parameter is not provided, all index values are shown.
    - `index_name`: This parameter is used to specify the name of the index column. If this parameter is not provided, the check will use the first index column it finds.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the `IndexTrainTestLeakage` check with different parameters. For example, it shows how to use the check with only one index value to be shown, and how to use the check with a specific index name.

    Please note that the `deepchecks` library is not installed in your environment. You can install it using pip:

    ```
    pip install deepchecks
    ```

    Also, please make sure to have the necessary permissions to run the code.
