    The code you provided is a mix of Maven dependencies and Jupyter notebook cells. Here's a brief explanation of what each section does:

    1. Maven dependencies: These are the libraries that are used in the project. The `%maven` directives are used to add Maven dependencies to the project. The `<dependency>` tag in the Jupyter notebook is used to add dependencies to a Maven project.

    2. Jupyter notebook cells: These are used to write code and results in a Jupyter notebook. The `%%loadFromPOM` directive is used to load Maven dependencies from a POM file. The `%load` directive is used to load a Jupyter notebook file.

    3. Java code: This section contains Java code snippets. The `import` statements are used to import Java packages and classes. The `public` keyword is used to make a method or variable public, which means it can be accessed from any part of the program.

    4. MXNet and TableSaw: These are used for machine learning and data manipulation respectively. MXNet is a deep learning framework that allows for easy creation of neural networks, while TableSaw is a library for data manipulation and visualization.

    5. Normal distribution: This is a function that calculates the normal distribution of a given array.

    6. Combine 3 arrays: This is a function that combines three arrays into one.

    7. Normal distribution table: This is a table that contains the normal distribution of a given array. It's used to visualize the normal distribution.

Please note that the code you provided is incomplete and may not work as expected. It's recommended to run the code in a Jupyter notebook environment to see the results.
