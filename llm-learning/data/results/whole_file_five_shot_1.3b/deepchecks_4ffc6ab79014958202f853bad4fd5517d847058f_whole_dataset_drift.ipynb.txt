    The code you provided is a Python script that uses the pandas, sklearn, and deepchecks libraries to load and preprocess an adult dataset, and then conducts a dataset drift check. The script also demonstrates how to use the deepchecks library to perform a dataset drift check.

    The script first imports the necessary libraries and loads the adult dataset. It then encodes the labels in the dataset and splits the dataset into a training set and a test set. The script then conducts a dataset drift check on the training set.

    The script then samples a subset of the training set and a test set, and conducts a new dataset drift check on the sampled training and test sets.

    The script ends with a dataset drift check on the test set.

    The script uses the deepchecks library to perform a dataset drift check. The check is a simple one that checks if the overall drift value of the dataset is greater than a certain threshold.

    The script also uses the deepchecks library to perform a dataset drift check on the sampled training and test sets. The check is a simple one that checks if the overall drift value of the sampled training and test sets is greater than a certain threshold.

    The script also uses the deepchecks library to perform a dataset drift check on the test set. The check is a simple one that checks if the overall drift value of the test set is greater than a certain threshold.

    The script ends with a dataset drift check on the test set.
