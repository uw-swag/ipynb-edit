```python
    import numpy as np

    def softmax(x):
        """Compute softmax values for each scores in x."""
        e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))
        return e_x / e_x.sum()
    ```
    This function computes the softmax of a given input vector `x`. The softmax function is a generalization of the logistic function to multi-class classification problems. It outputs a vector where the `i`th element is the probability of the `i`th class.

    The softmax function is defined as:

    `softmax(x) = exp(x) / Σexp(y)`

    where `exp(x)` is the exponential function, and `Σexp(y)` is the sum of the exponentials of all elements in the input vector `x`.

    The softmax function is used in the output layer of a neural network for multi-class classification problems.

    The softmax function is often used in the output layer of a neural network for multi-class classification problems.
