```python
    # refactor notebook folder structure
    ## Code:
    import os
    import shutil

    # define the source and destination folders
    source_folder = "/path/to/source/folder"
    destination_folder = "/path/to/destination/folder"

    # copy all files from source to destination
    shutil.copytree(source_folder, destination_folder)

    # remove source folder
    shutil.rmtree(source_folder)
    ```
    ## Explanation:
    This code will copy all files from the source folder to the destination folder. Then, it will remove the source folder.

    Please replace "/path/to/source/folder" and "/path/to/destination/folder" with the actual paths.
