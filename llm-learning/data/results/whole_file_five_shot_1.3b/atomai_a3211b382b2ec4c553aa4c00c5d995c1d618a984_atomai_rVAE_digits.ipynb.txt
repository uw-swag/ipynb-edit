    The code you provided is a set of instructions for training a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and a reversed Variational Autoencoder (rVAE) on the MNIST dataset using the AtomAI library.

    The code starts by installing the AtomAI library, then imports necessary libraries and loads the MNIST dataset. It then normalizes the images and displays some of them.

    The code then trains the VAE and rVAE on the MNIST dataset. The VAE is trained for 100 training cycles, and the rVAE is trained for 100 training cycles with a rotation prior.

    Finally, the code generates some samples from the trained models and displays them.

    Please note that the code is written in a Jupyter notebook format and uses the AtomAI library. The actual training of the models and the generation of the samples might take a while depending on the hardware and the complexity of the models.

    Also, the code does not include the actual training of the models. The actual training of the models is done in the next set of cells.

    The AtomAI library is a machine learning library that provides a high-level interface for training and evaluating models. It is designed to be easy to use and to be compatible with a wide range of deep learning frameworks.

    The code is written in Python and uses the PyTorch library for the machine learning part.

    The code is not runnable as it is a set of instructions for the Colaboratory notebook. You need to run the code in a Colaboratory notebook to see the results.
