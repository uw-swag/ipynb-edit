    '''
    This code is written in Python and uses several libraries such as numpy, pandas, geopandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and keras. The code is designed to perform various tasks such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

    The code is divided into several cells, each of which contains a specific task or operation. The code is divided into several sections to make it easier to understand and maintain.

    The first section is a setup code, which includes importing necessary libraries and defining functions for metrics calculation and neural network model creation.

    The next sections are data preprocessing and model training. The preprocessing section includes cleaning and transforming data, and the training section includes creating and training the neural network models.

    The final section is model evaluation. The evaluation section includes comparing the predictions of the models to the actual targets.

    The code also includes plots to visualize the performance of the models.

    The final section is a demonstration of how to use the preprocessed data and the trained models to make predictions.

    The code is written in a Jupyter notebook format, which allows for interactive execution of the code and the display of the results.
