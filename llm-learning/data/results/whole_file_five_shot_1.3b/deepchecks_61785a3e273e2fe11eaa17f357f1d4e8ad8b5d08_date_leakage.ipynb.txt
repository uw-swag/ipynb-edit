    The check `DateTrainValidationLeakageDuplicates` is designed to detect duplicate entries in the training dataset. It compares the training dataset with the validation dataset and identifies any instances where the same entry appears more than once.

    The check `DateTrainValidationLeakageOverlap` is designed to detect overlapping entries in the training dataset. It compares the training dataset with the validation dataset and identifies any instances where the same entry appears more than once.

    The `CheckSuite` is a class that runs the checks and provides a summary of the results.

    The `dataset_from_dict` function is used to create a `Dataset` object from a dictionary. The dictionary should contain a 'date' column and the date values. The 'date' column is used to determine the date of each entry.

    The `run` method of the `CheckSuite` class is used to run the checks on the given `train_dataset` and `validation_dataset`.

    The `DateTrainValidationLeakageDuplicates` and `DateTrainValidationLeakageOverlap` checks are designed to detect and report any instances where the same entry appears more than once in the training or validation datasets.

    The `run` method of the `CheckSuite` class is used to run the checks on the given `train_dataset` and `validation_dataset`.
