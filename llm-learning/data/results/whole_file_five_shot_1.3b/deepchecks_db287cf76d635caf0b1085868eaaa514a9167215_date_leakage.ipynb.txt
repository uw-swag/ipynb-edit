    The code provided in the notebook is a demonstration of how to use the `DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap` and `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` checks in the `mlchecks` library. These checks are used to detect and handle leakage in the training and validation datasets.

    The `DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap` check identifies instances where the same date is present in both the training and validation datasets. This could be due to a data error or a system error.

    The `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check identifies instances where the same date is present in the training dataset but not in the validation dataset. This could be due to a system error or a data error.

    The notebook demonstrates how to use these checks by comparing the training and validation datasets. The `suite.run()` method is used to execute the checks and print the results.

    The notebook also demonstrates how to handle the leakage in the training and validation datasets by removing the instances that are present in both datasets. This could be done by either removing the instances from the training dataset or the validation dataset.
