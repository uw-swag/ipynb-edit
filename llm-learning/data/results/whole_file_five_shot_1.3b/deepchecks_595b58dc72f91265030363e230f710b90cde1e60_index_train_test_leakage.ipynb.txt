    ## Vision Documentation

    This section will contain the documentation related to the Vision module.

    ### 1. Introduction

    The Vision module is responsible for generating visualizations of the predicted captions. It takes as input the predicted captions and the actual captions, and generates visualizations that can be used for debugging and understanding the predictions.

    ### 2. Usage

    The Vision module can be used in a Jupyter notebook or a script. It takes as input the predicted captions and the actual captions, and generates visualizations that can be used for debugging and understanding the predictions.

    ### 3. Examples

    Here are some examples of how to use the Vision module:

    ```python
    from vision import Vision

    # Initialize the Vision module
    vision = Vision()

    # Predict the captions
    predicted_captions = vision.predict(actual_captions)

    # Generate visualizations
    vision.generate_visualization(predicted_captions, actual_captions)
    ```

    ### 4. Future Work

    The Vision module is a basic implementation and may need to be further developed to handle more complex tasks.
