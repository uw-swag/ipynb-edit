    The commit message "[Automatic] Examples Update (#411)" suggests that the examples have been updated. However, the provided code is not clear enough to provide a meaningful explanation. 

    The code is importing necessary libraries and creating a random DataFrame. The code then creates a Dataset object from the DataFrame. The last two lines are running two checks on the Dataset: IdentifierLeakage and a custom check.

    The commit message is not clear about what these checks are doing or what the purpose of the code is. Could you please provide more context or clarify what the code is supposed to do?
