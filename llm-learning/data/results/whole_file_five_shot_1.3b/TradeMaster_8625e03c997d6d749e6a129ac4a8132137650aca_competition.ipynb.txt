    ## Project Structure

    The project structure is as follows:

    ```
    - agent
        - EIIE
            - model.py
            - util.py
            - trader.py
    - env
        - PM
            - portfolio_for_EIIE.py
    - result
        - EIIE
            - trained_model
            - test_result
    - data
        - test_input_1.csv
        - test_input_2.csv
    ```

    The `agent` directory contains the code for the EIIE (Environment-Independent Intelligence Evaluation) agent. The `EIIE` directory contains the main classes for the agent, including the `trader` class. The `model` directory contains the PyTorch models for the agent. The `util` directory contains utility functions for the agent. The `env` directory contains the environment for the agent. The `result` directory contains the results of the agent. The `data` directory contains the test data for the agent.

    The `portfolio_for_EIIE.py` file in the `env/PM` directory is the environment for the agent. It defines the environment and provides methods for interacting with the environment.

    The `trader.py` file in the `agent/EIIE` directory is the trader class for the agent. It defines the trader and provides methods for training and testing the agent.

    The `model.py`, `util.py`, and `trader.py` files in the `agent/EIIE` directory are the main files for the agent. They contain the main code for the agent.

    The `trained_model` and `test_result` directories in the `result/EIIE` directory contain the trained models and the test results of the agent.

    The `test_input_1.csv` and `test_input_2.csv` files in the `data` directory contain the test data for the agent.

    The `README.md` file in the root directory contains the project documentation.

    The `.gitignore` file is used to ignore files that should not be tracked by Git.

    The `requirements.txt` file is used
