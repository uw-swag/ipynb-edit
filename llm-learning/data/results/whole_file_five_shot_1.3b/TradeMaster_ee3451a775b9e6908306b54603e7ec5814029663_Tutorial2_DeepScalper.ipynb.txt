    The code you provided seems to be a complete script for training a deep reinforcement learning agent using the PyTorch library. However, there are a few areas that could be improved for better code readability and maintainability.

1. The `build_net`, `build_optimizer`, and `build_loss` functions are quite complex and could be broken down into smaller, more manageable functions.

2. The `build_agent` function is also quite complex. It seems like the agent is being built based on the configuration, but the actual building of the agent is not shown.

3. The `build_transition` function is also complex. It seems like the transition function is being built based on the configuration, but the actual building of the transition function is not shown.

4. The `build_trainer` function is also complex. It seems like the trainer is being built based on the configuration, but the actual building of the trainer is not shown.

5. The `parse_args` function is not very clear. It seems like the arguments for the script are being parsed, but the actual parsing of the arguments is not shown.

6. The `cfg` variable is not used anywhere in the code. It seems like the configuration is being used, but the actual usage of the configuration is not shown.

7. The `trainer.train_and_valid()` and `trainer.test()` lines are not very clear. They seem to be calling the `train` and `test` methods of the trainer, but the actual calling of these methods is not shown.

8. The code is not very modular. It seems like the code is being run from top to bottom, but the actual order of the code is not shown.

9. The code is not very well formatted. It seems like the code is being run from top to bottom, but the actual order of the code is not shown.

10. The code is not very clear. It seems like the code is being run from top to bottom, but the actual order of the code is not shown.

11. The code is not very modular. It seems like the code is being run from top to bottom, but the actual order of the code is not shown.
