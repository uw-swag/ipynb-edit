    ## Vision

    The Vision of the project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately predict house prices based on a variety of features. The model will be trained on a dataset of home sales from Iowa, and it will be able to predict the price of a home with a certain set of features.

    ## Features

    The features used in the model are:

    - `LotArea`: The total area of the house.
    - `YearBuilt`: The year when the house was built.
    - `1stFlrSF`: The square footage of the first floor of the house.
    - `2ndFlrSF`: The square footage of the second floor of the house.
    - `FullBath`: The full bathrooms number in the house.
    - `BedroomAbvGr`: The bedrooms above ground attribute.
    - `TotRmsAbvGrd`: The total rooms above ground attribute.

    ## Goals

    The main goals of the project are:

    - To develop a model that can accurately predict house prices.
    - To improve the accuracy of the model by using a variety of features.
    - To create a user-friendly interface for users to input their own features and receive a prediction.

    ## Challenges

    The project faced several challenges:

    - Data preprocessing: The dataset was not clean, containing missing values and outliers.
    - Feature selection: The dataset was not large enough to train a model.
    - Model selection: The model was not suitable for the task.
    - Model training: The model was not able to train effectively.

    ## Future Work

    The project plans to:

    - Improve the model by using more data.
    - Improve the feature selection process.
    - Improve the model by using more advanced techniques.
    - Create a more user-friendly interface.

    ## Conclusion

    The project has successfully completed, and the model is now ready to be used to predict house prices.
