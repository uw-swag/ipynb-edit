    The code you provided is a mix of Python code and Jupyter notebook cells. It includes examples of using DeepChecks library for data inspection, condition creation, and suite creation.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - Cell_0: This cell imports the `DatasetsSizeComparison` check from DeepChecks and adds a condition to it.
    - Cell_1: This cell creates a dummy dataset and runs the check on the training and test datasets.
    - Cell_2: This cell accesses a check by its id and removes a condition by its id.
    - Cell_3: This cell re-adds a condition with a new parameter.
    - Cell_4: This cell runs a check with a custom condition.
    - Cell_5: This cell runs a check with a custom condition and returns the result.
    - Cell_6: This cell defines a custom condition for the `DatasetsSizeComparison` check.
    - Cell_7: This cell uses a suite to run the check and condition.
    - Cell_8: This cell defines a custom condition for the `DatasetsSizeComparison` check and uses it to create a condition.

    Please note that the code is written in a mix of Python and Jupyter notebook cells, which is a common format for data science projects.
