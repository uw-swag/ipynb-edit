    # LeNet Architecture

    # LeNet is a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture used for image classification tasks. It was proposed by Yann LeCun, LÃ©on Bottou, and Yoshua Bengio in 1998.

    # The architecture consists of a series of convolutional layers, followed by max-pooling layers, and finally a fully connected layer.

    # The first layer is a 2D convolutional layer with 1 input image channel, 6 output channels, and a 5x5 kernel. The stride is set to 1, padding is set to 0.

    # The second layer is a 2D convolutional layer with 6 input channels, 16 output channels, and a 5x5 kernel. The stride is set to 1, padding is set to 0.

    # The output of the second layer is passed through a fully connected layer with 120 output units.

    # The third layer is a 2D convolutional layer with 16 input channels, 120 output channels, and a 5x5 kernel. The stride is set to 1, padding is set to 0.

    # The output of the third layer is passed through another fully connected layer with 84 output units.

    # The final layer is a 10-unit fully connected layer with a softmax activation function, which is used for multi-class classification.

    # The model is trained using the backpropagation algorithm, which is a popular optimization algorithm for neural networks.

    # The LeNet model is a good starting point for image classification tasks, but it can be further improved by adding more layers, changing the number of filters, or using more advanced techniques like dropout or data augmentation.
