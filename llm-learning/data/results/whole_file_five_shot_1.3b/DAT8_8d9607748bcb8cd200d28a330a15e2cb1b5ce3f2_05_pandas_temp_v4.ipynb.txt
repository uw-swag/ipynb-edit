    ## Temporary Notebooks

    These notebooks are meant to be temporary and are not meant to be used for actual analysis or model development. They are here for demonstration purposes and to help you understand how to use the features of the notebooks.

    - `notebook1.ipynb`: This is a placeholder for your first notebook. You can start with this one and then use it as a starting point for your own notebooks.
    - `notebook2.ipynb`: This is another placeholder for your second notebook. You can use this one as a starting point for your own notebooks.
    - `notebook3.ipynb`: This is a placeholder for your third notebook. You can use this one as a starting point for your own notebooks.

    Please replace the placeholders with your actual notebook names and content.
