    The code you've provided seems to be a Jupyter notebook with a mix of Python and Jupyter notebook markdown cells. It's a combination of Python code and Jupyter notebook markdown cells. 

    The code is used to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification using the Deep Learning library DJL. The model is trained on the FashionMnist dataset, a dataset of Zalando's article images.

    The notebook also includes code to evaluate the model's performance, plot the loss and accuracy over epochs, and display the model's performance in a more readable format.

    However, the code you've provided is not complete and does not run as expected. It seems to be incomplete and contains syntax errors.
