```python
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

    # Load iris dataset
    iris = load_iris()

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris.data, iris.target, test_size=0.3, random_state=1)

    # Create a DecisionTreeClassifier
    clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()

    # Train the model using the training sets
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Predict the response for test dataset
    y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

    # Model Accuracy
    print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
    ```
    This code will train a Decision Tree Classifier on the iris dataset, then use it to make predictions on the test set. The accuracy of the model is then printed out.
