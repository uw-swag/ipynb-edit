    The code you provided is a part of a larger project, and it seems to be related to medical image analysis, specifically, the task of skin cancer detection. The code includes importing necessary libraries, loading and preprocessing data, training a model, evaluating the model, and visualizing the results.

    However, the code you provided is not complete and does not include the entirety of the project. It is missing the part where the model is trained and evaluated on the ISIC dataset, and the part where the model's predictions are made.

    Here is a brief explanation of the missing parts:

    1. The model is trained and evaluated on the ISIC dataset.
    2. The model's predictions are made.

    Please provide the complete code for the missing parts.
