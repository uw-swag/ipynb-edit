    The Perceptron is a type of artificial neural network that is used for binary classification. It is a simple yet powerful algorithm for learning from data.

    The Perceptron is a binary classifier, meaning it can only classify data into two categories. The algorithm works by taking an input vector, calculating the dot product of the input vector and the weight vector, and then applying a linear threshold gate to the result. The threshold is a hyperparameter that determines the decision boundary.

    The dot product of the input vector and the weight vector is used to calculate the activation of the perceptron. The activation is the result of the linear threshold gate applied to the dot product.

    The weights of the perceptron are updated based on the error of the prediction. The error is the difference between the actual output and the predicted output. The weights are updated in the direction of the error, with a step size proportional to the error.

    The process of updating the weights and the activation of the perceptron is repeated for each input vector in the input table.

    The weights of the perceptron are learned from the input table, and the activation of the perceptron is used to make predictions.

    The weights of the perceptron are updated in a way that minimizes the error of the prediction. This is the basis of the learning algorithm for the Perceptron.
