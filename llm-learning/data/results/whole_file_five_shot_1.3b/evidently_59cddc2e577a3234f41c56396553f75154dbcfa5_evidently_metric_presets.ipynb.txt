The code you provided is a series of operations performed on a dataset, including fetching a dataset, cleaning the data, and performing various data analysis and visualization tasks. The operations are performed using the pandas, numpy, sklearn, and evidently libraries.

The operations include:

1. Fetching a dataset from the openml repository.
2. Cleaning the data by removing rows with missing values.
3. Performing data analysis and visualization tasks.
4. Using the evidently library to generate a report on the data drift.

The code also includes operations for regression, binary classification, multiclass classification, and target drift.

The operations are performed in the following cells:

- Cell 2: Fetching the adult dataset and cleaning the data.
- Cell 3: Fetching the housing dataset and cleaning the data.
- Cell 4: Fetching the breast cancer dataset and cleaning the data.
- Cell 5: Fetching the iris dataset and cleaning the data.
- Cell 6: Generating a report on the data drift.
- Cell 7: Generating a report on the data quality.
- Cell 8: Generating a report on the regression performance.
- Cell 9: Generating a report on the classification performance.
- Cell 10: Generating a report on the target drift.
- Cell 11: Generating a report on the multiclass classification.
- Cell 12: Generating a report on the binary classification.
- Cell 13: Generating a report on the target drift.
- Cell 14: Generating a report on the multiclass classification.
- Cell 15: Generating a report on the binary classification.
- Cell 16: Generating a report on the target drift.
- Cell 17: Generating a report on the regression performance.

The operations are performed in a series of steps, each step involving fetching a dataset, cleaning the data, performing data analysis, and generating a report. The operations are performed using the pandas, numpy, sklearn, and evidently libraries.

The operations are performed in the following cells:

- Cell 2: Fetching the adult dataset and cleaning the data.
- Cell 3: Fetching the housing dataset and cleaning the data.
