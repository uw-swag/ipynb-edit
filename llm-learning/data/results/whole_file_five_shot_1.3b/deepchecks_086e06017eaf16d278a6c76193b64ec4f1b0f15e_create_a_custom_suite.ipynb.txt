    ## Code Explanation:
    The code imports the necessary libraries and modules. It then defines a suite of checks for model performance. The suite includes information about the model, performance report, confusion matrix report, and simple model comparison. The suite is then run on a random forest classifier model. The suite is then modified by removing a check and adding a new one with a condition. The suite's name is updated and the modified suite is run.
