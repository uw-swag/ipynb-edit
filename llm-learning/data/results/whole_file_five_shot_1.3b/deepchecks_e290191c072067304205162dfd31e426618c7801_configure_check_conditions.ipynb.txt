    The code you provided is a mix of Python code and Jupyter notebook cells. It includes examples of data analysis, machine learning models, and deep learning checks. 

    Here's a brief explanation of what each code cell does:

    1. `<Cell_0>` and `<Cell_1>`: These cells are examples of using the `DatasetsSizeComparison` check in the `deepchecks` library. The `DatasetsSizeComparison` check is used to compare the size of two datasets.

    2. `<Cell_2>`: This cell is an example of using the `train_test_leakage` suite in the `deepchecks` library. The `train_test_leakage` suite is a suite of checks that are used to detect potential leakage in training and testing datasets.

    3. `<Cell_3>`: This cell is an example of removing a condition from a suite.

    4. `<Cell_4>`: This cell is an example of adding a new condition to a suite.

    5. `<Cell_5>`: This cell is an example of using a custom condition in a check.

    6. `<Cell_6>`: This cell is an example of creating a custom condition for a check.

    7. `<Cell_7>`: This cell is an example of using a suite to run a check and condition.

    8. `<Cell_8>`: This cell is an example of creating a custom condition for a check.

    Each of these cells is a part of a larger codebase that demonstrates how to use different features of the `deepchecks` library.
