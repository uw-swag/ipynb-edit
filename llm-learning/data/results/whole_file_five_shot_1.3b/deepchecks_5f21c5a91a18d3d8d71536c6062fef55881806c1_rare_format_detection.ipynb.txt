    The `RareFormatDetection` class is a custom check that you can use to detect rare formats in your data. The `check_rare_formats` method is where you should implement the logic to detect rare formats.

    The `Tags.RARE_FORMATS` tag is used to store the result of the check. You can use it to filter the results in your report.

    The `run` method of the `RareFormatDetection` class is the method that will be called to run the check. It takes a `Dataset` as input and returns the same `Dataset` with the result of the check added to it.

    The `check_rare_formats` method is a placeholder for the logic to detect rare formats. You should implement this method according to your specific requirements.

    The `RareFormatDetection` class is a part of the `deepchecks` library, which is a Python library for data validation and quality checks.

    The `deepchecks` library is not installed by default, you need to install it using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install deepchecks
    ```

    After installing the library, you can use the `RareFormatDetection` class to detect rare formats in your data.

    The `run` method of the `RareFormatDetection` class is the method that will be called to run the check. It takes a `Dataset` as input and returns the same `Dataset` with the
