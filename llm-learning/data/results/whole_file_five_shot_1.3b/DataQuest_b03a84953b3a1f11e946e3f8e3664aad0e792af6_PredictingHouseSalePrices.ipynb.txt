    The code provided is a simple example of how to use a linear regression model to predict house sale prices. The code first loads the data, then selects a subset of features and trains a linear regression model on these features. The RMSE of the model's predictions is then calculated and returned.

    However, there are a few improvements that can be made to this code:

    1. The `transform_features` function is not defined. It seems like you want to perform some transformations on the data, but the code is not provided.

    2. The `select_features` function is not defined. It seems like you want to select a subset of features to use in the model, but the code is not provided.

    3. The `train_and_test` function is not defined. It seems like you want to train a model on the training data, make predictions on the test data, and calculate the RMSE of the predictions, but the code is not provided.

    4. The code does not include any data preprocessing or feature engineering steps. This could be a good place to include steps like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical variables.

    5. The code does not include any feature selection or feature extraction steps. This could be a good place to include steps like using feature importance from the model, or using feature correlation with the target variable.

    6. The code does not include any model evaluation steps. This could be a good place to include steps like cross-validation, and comparing different models.

    7. The code does not include any hyperparameter tuning steps. This could be a good place to include steps like using grid search or random search to find the best hyperparameters for the model.

    8. The code does not include any visualization steps. This could be a good place to include steps like creating plots to visualize the model's predictions and the actual values.

    Please provide the complete code for the improved version of the code.
