    The code provided is an example of how to use the Deepchecks library to perform a dataset size comparison check.

    The Deepchecks library is a Python library for data quality checks, which can be used to ensure the quality of the data.

    The check is performed on the training and testing datasets. The check is designed to ensure that the size of the testing dataset is not smaller than the size of the training dataset, and that the ratio of the size of the testing dataset to the size of the training dataset is not smaller than 0.2.

    The result of the check is a report of the results of the check, which can be used to identify any issues with the data.

    The Deepchecks library is not included in the original code, but it can be installed using pip:

    ```
    pip install deepchecks
    ```

    The code provided is a part of a larger codebase, and it's not clear what the purpose of the code is.
