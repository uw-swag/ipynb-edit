    The code provided is an example of how to use the DeepChecks library to perform an IndexTrainTestLeakage check. This check is used to detect if the index used in the training dataset is present in the test dataset.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    1. The `dataset_from_dict` function is a utility function that takes a dictionary and an optional index name, and returns a `Dataset` object.

    2. The `IndexTrainTestLeakage` check is then used to run the check on two datasets. The `run` method of the `IndexTrainTestLeakage` check takes two `Dataset` objects as input, and returns a `CheckResult` object.

    3. The `IndexTrainTestLeakage` check can be run with and without the `n_index_to_show` parameter, which determines the number of indices to display in the check result.

    4. The last three cells of the code are examples of how to use the `IndexTrainTestLeakage` check. The first two use the `dataset_from_dict` function to create a training and test dataset, and then run the `IndexTrainTestLeakage` check on them. The third example shows how to run the check with the `n_index_to_show` parameter set to 1, which displays only the first index in the check result.

    Please note that the DeepChecks library is not installed in this environment, so you will need to install it using pip before running the code.

    The code is written in Python and uses the DeepChecks library, which is a Python library for data quality checks.
