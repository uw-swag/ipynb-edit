    The code you provided is a part of a larger codebase, and it seems to be related to image processing and object detection. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    1. The code imports necessary libraries and classes.
    2. It creates an instance of `NDManager` and `Image`.
    3. It downloads an image from a URL and gets its width and height.
    4. It generates anchor boxes for the image using `MultiBoxPrior`.
    5. It reshapes the anchor boxes to the shape required by `drawBBoxes`.
    6. It draws bounding boxes on the image using `drawBBoxes`.
    7. It duplicates the image and draws bounding boxes on it.
    8. It generates ground truth and anchors for the image.
    9. It generates output from the model.
    10. It draws bounding boxes on the image using the output from the model.

    The code seems to be part of a larger system that uses deep learning to detect objects in images. The `drawBBoxes` function is used to draw bounding boxes on the image, and the `MultiBoxDetection` class is used to detect objects in the image.

    Please note that the code is incomplete and may not work as expected. It's a part of a larger system and may require additional error handling and optimization.
