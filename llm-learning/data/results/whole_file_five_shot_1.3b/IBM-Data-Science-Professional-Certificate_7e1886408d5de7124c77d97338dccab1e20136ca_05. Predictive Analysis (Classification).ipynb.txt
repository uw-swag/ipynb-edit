    The code you've provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses various machine learning algorithms to predict the classification of legal documents. The notebook starts by importing necessary libraries and defining some helper functions. It then reads in a dataset, preprocesses the data, splits it into training and testing sets, and applies a grid search to find the best hyperparameters for each of the algorithms. The best hyperparameters for each algorithm are then printed and the accuracy of the model is also printed. The confusion matrix is also plotted for each algorithm.

    The notebook ends with a final dataframe that shows the accuracy of each algorithm and the best score achieved for each algorithm.

    The notebook is designed to be interactive and allows the user to run the code in a cell by pressing Shift + Enter. The code is written in Python and uses the libraries pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, and openai.

    The notebook is designed to be run in a Jupyter notebook environment. The code is compatible with Jupyter notebook versions 2.x and 3.x.
