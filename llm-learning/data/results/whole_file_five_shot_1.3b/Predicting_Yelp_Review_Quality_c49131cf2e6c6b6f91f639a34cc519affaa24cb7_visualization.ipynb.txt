```python
    # Duplicate Record Problem
    # This problem occurs when there are duplicate records in the data.
    # The data might be incorrectly duplicated, or it might be a mistake.
    # The goal of this problem is to find and correct the duplicates.

    # Here is a simple example of how to find and remove duplicates in a pandas DataFrame:

    import pandas as pd

    # Assume df is your DataFrame
    df = pd.DataFrame({
        'A': [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6],
        'B': ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j']
    })

    # Find duplicates
    duplicates = df.duplicated()

    # Remove duplicates
    df = df[~duplicates]
    ```

    Please replace the code in the original code cells with the above code to solve the duplicate record problem.
