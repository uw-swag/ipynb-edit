    The code you provided is a set of examples for a machine learning pipeline using the deepchecks library. The pipeline includes preprocessing of categorical and numerical data, training a decision tree model, and then using the TrainTestFeatureDrift check to evaluate the drift in the feature distribution.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The code imports necessary libraries and modules.
    - It sets a seed for the random number generator for reproducibility.
    - It generates random data for training and testing.
    - It converts the data to the correct data types.
    - It creates a pipeline that handles categorical data by converting it to an ordinal encoding and numerical data by adding a random noise.
    - It trains a decision tree model on the training data.
    - It evaluates the model using the TrainTestFeatureDrift check.
    - It prints the results of the check.
    - It adds a condition to the check to ensure that the PSI (Performance Score Index) and Earth Mover's Distance (a measure of dissimilarity between distributions) are not greater than a certain value.
    - Finally, it prints the conditions that were not satisfied.

    Please note that the code is a simple example and may not work as expected in a real-world scenario. It's always a good idea to test and validate the results of your machine learning pipeline.
