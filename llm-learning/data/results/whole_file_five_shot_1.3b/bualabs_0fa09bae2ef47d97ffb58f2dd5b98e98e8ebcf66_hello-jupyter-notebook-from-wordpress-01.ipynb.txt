```python
    # Create a new file in the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
    with open('/wp-content/plugins/my_plugin.py', 'w') as file:
        file.write('''
        #!/usr/bin/python
        # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

        def my_function():
            print("Hello, World!")

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            my_function()
        ''')
    ```

    This code will create a new Python file in the /wp-content/plugins/ directory with the name "my_plugin.py". The file will contain a simple Python script that prints "Hello, World!" when run.

    Please replace "my_plugin.py" with the actual name of your plugin.

    Also, make sure to have the necessary permissions to write to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.

    Please note that this is a simple example and may not be suitable for a production environment.
