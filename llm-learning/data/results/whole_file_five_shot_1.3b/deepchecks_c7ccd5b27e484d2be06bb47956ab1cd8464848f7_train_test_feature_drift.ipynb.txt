    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook, and it's written in Python. The notebook is using the Deepchecks library to analyze the drift in the data. The drift is measured by the PSI (Performance Score Index) and the Earth Mover's Distance. The PSI measures the difference in performance between two distributions, while the Earth Mover's Distance measures the difference in distributions.

    The code is divided into several cells. The first cell imports the necessary libraries and sets a seed for the random number generator. The next cell creates some example data. The next cell displays the first few rows of the data. The next cell adds some randomness to the 'numeric_with_drift' column and adds a categorical column. The next cell defines a pipeline for handling categorical data, and a decision tree classifier. The next cell trains the model and creates a dataset for the test data. The next cell runs the drift check and displays the result. The next cell adds a condition to the check to only include results where the drift score is not greater than a certain value. The last cell runs the conditioned check and displays the result.

    The code is written in a way that it should be run in a Jupyter notebook environment.
