    The code above is a commit message for a version bump in the DeepChecks library. The version bump is a process of updating the version of the library. In this case, the version is set to 0.4.0. The commit message is also updated to reflect the new version.

    The code also includes an import statement for the AdaBoostClassifier from sklearn, a dataset from sklearn, and a function to split the dataset into training and testing sets. The DeepChecks library is also imported, and a ConfusionMatrixReport check is created.

    The ConfusionMatrixReport check is then run on the dataset and the AdaBoostClassifier.
