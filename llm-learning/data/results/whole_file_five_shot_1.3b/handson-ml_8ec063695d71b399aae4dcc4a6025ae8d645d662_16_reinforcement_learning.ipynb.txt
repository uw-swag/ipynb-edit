    ## Policy Gradients

    Policy Gradients are a type of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm that uses a policy to choose actions in an environment. The policy is a function that maps states to actions. The policy gradient is a measure of how good an action was chosen, and it is calculated by taking the gradient of the expected return with respect to the chosen action.

    ## Deep Q-Network (DQN)

    DQN is a type of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm that uses a Q-function to estimate the value of actions in an environment. The Q-function is a function that maps states to a value. DQN uses a neural network to estimate the Q-values of actions in the environment, and it learns to do this by taking actions and observing the results.

    ## Reinforcement Learning in Gym

    Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a method of learning in which an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. The agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment, and the environment learns to provide the agent with the desired reward.

    ## OpenAI Gym

    OpenAI Gym is a toolkit for developing and train reinforcement learning agents. It provides a simple, consistent API for all reinforcement learning algorithms, and it also provides a suite of environments that the agents can learn to interact with.
