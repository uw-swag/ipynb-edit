    # Section 13.3 - Bounding boxes
    ## Bounding boxes are a fundamental concept in computer vision. They are a way to describe a region in an image, and are often used to identify objects, edges, or faces.

    ## 1. Bounding box coordinates
    # A bounding box is defined by four points: the top-left corner (x1, y1), the bottom-right corner (x2, y2), and the top-right corner (x3, y3), and the bottom-left corner (x4, y4).

    ## 2. Bounding box area
    # The area of a bounding box is calculated as the product of the lengths of its sides.

    ## 3. Bounding box center
    # The center of a bounding box is calculated as the average of its top-left and bottom-right corners.

    ## 4. Bounding box intersection
    # The intersection of two bounding boxes is the set of points that both boxes overlap.

    ## 5. Bounding box union
    # The union of two bounding boxes is the set of points that both boxes overlap and are not overlapping with any of the other boxes.

    ## 6. Bounding box IOU
    # The Intersection over Union (IOU) between two bounding boxes is the ratio of the area of their intersection to the area of their union.

    ## 7. Bounding box NMS
    # Non-maximum suppression (NMS) is a method used to eliminate overlapping bounding boxes with varying confidence scores.

    ## 8. Bounding box Anchor Boxes
    # Anchor boxes are a type of bounding box that are used to generate a set of bounding boxes for a given object. They are used in object detection and are a more general form of bounding boxes.

    ## 9. Bounding box Visualization
    # Visualization of bounding boxes is a common task in computer vision. It involves converting the coordinates of the bounding boxes into a form that can be easily visualized.

    ## 10. Bounding box Applications
    # Bounding boxes are widely used in various applications in computer vision, such as object detection, face detection
