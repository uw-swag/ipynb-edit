    The code you've provided is a rework of the `TargetDriftPreset` from the `evidently` library. The `TargetDriftPreset` is a class that provides a set of default metrics for target drift. The `remove_old_target_drift_presets` method is not part of the `TargetDriftPreset` class, so it's not included in the code you've provided.

    However, if you're looking to remove the old target drift presets, you can do so by using the `remove_preset` method from the `Report` class. Here's an example:

    ```python
    from evidently.report import Report

    # ...

    # Create a report
    report = Report(metrics=[
        DataDriftPreset(),
    ])

    # Run the report
    report.run(reference_data=adult_ref, current_data=adult_cur)

    # Remove the old target drift preset
    report.remove_preset('TargetDriftPreset')

    # Run the report again
    report.run(reference_data=adult_ref, current_data=adult_cur)
    ```

    This will remove the old target drift preset from the report, and the new one will be used.

    Please note that the `remove_preset` method is not available in the current version of `evidently`. You may need to upgrade to the latest version of the library for this functionality.

    Also, the `remove_preset` method is not part of the `TargetDriftPreset` class, so it's not included in the code you've provided.

    If you're looking to remove the old target drift presets, you can do so by using the `remove_preset` method from the `Report` class. Here's an example:

    ```python
    from evidently.report import Report

    # ...

    # Create a report
    report = Report(metrics=[
        DataDriftPreset(),
    ])

    # Run the report
    report.run(reference_data=adult_ref, current_data=adult_cur)
