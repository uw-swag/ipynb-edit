    The code you provided is a Python script that uses the pandas, sklearn, and deepchecks libraries to load and preprocess an adult dataset, and then conducts a dataset drift check on the preprocessed data.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    1. The script first imports the necessary libraries and loads the adult dataset.
    2. It then splits the dataset into a training set and a test set.
    3. The script encodes the labels in the training set and the test set using a label encoder.
    4. The script then creates a dataset object for the training and test sets, and defines the categorical features.
    5. The script then conducts a dataset drift check on the training set and the test set.
    6. The script then samples a subset of the training set and the test set to reduce the size of the dataset.
    7. The script then conducts another dataset drift check on the sampled training and test sets.

    The code is designed to demonstrate how to preprocess and check for dataset drift in a machine learning project.
