    The `display_name` parameter is added to the descriptor and feature classes in the evidently library. This parameter is used to provide a human-readable name for the metric or test, which can be useful for debugging and documentation purposes.

    Here's an example of how to use the `display_name` parameter:

    ```python
    from evidently.metrics import ColumnSummaryMetric

    column_summary_metric = ColumnSummaryMetric(
        column_name='Review_Text',
        display_name='Average Word Count'
    )

    table_column_metrics_report.add_metric(column_summary_metric)
    ```

    In this example, the `display_name` parameter is set to 'Average Word Count', which is a more descriptive name for the metric.

    The `display_name` parameter is also used in the `Report` class to provide a more readable name for the report, and in the `TestSuite` class to provide a more readable name for the test suite.

    The `display_name` parameter is also used in the `ColumnMapping` class to provide a more readable name for the column mapping.

    The `display_name` parameter is a good practice to make the metrics and tests more understandable and maintainable.

    Please note that the `display_name` parameter is not used in the current version of the evidently library. The library is under active development and may have additional features in the future.
