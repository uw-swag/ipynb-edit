The code you've provided is a demonstration of how to use the `DataSampleLeakageReport` from the `mlchecks` library to check for leakage in the validation dataset.

The `DataSampleLeakageReport` is a class that provides a report of leakage in a validation dataset. The report includes information about the number of samples that are in the validation dataset that are not in the training dataset, and the proportion of these samples that are in the training dataset.

The `run` method of the `DataSampleLeakageReport` class is used to run the check. This method takes two parameters: `train_dataset` and `validation_dataset`. The `train_dataset` parameter is the dataset that contains the samples that were used to train the model, and the `validation_dataset` parameter is the dataset that contains the samples that are to be validated.

In the provided code, the `run` method is called with `validation_dataset` and `train_dataset` as arguments. This will run the check and print the report.

The report will show the number of samples that are in the validation dataset that are not in the training dataset, and the proportion of these samples that are in the training dataset. This can help identify if there is any leakage in the validation dataset.

Please note that the `DataSampleLeakageReport` class is not a part of the `mlchecks` library, and it's not recommended to use it in a production environment. It's a tool for debugging and understanding the leakage in a validation dataset.
