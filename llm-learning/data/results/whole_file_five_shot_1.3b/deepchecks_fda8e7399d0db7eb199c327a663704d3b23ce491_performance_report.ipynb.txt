    # Add log for column inference (#144)
    # The column inference process is done in the DeepChecks library.
    # The process involves identifying the most important features in the dataset.
    # The identified features are then used to train a model.
    # The model's performance is evaluated using a performance report.
    # The performance report provides a summary of the model's performance, including metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    # The identified features are also included in the report, which can be useful for understanding the importance of these features in the model's predictions.
