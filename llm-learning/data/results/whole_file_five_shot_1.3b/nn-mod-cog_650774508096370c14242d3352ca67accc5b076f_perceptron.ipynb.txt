    The perceptron model is a simple model that is used for binary classification tasks. It is a linear model that is used for classification. The limitations of the perceptron model are:

    1. It is not capable of handling complex functions.
    2. It is not capable of learning from large datasets.
    3. It is not capable of handling noisy or incomplete data.

    Conclusions from the perceptron model:

    1. The perceptron model is a simple and effective model for binary classification tasks.
    2. However, it is not suitable for complex functions and large datasets.
    3. It is not capable of learning from noisy or incomplete data.
