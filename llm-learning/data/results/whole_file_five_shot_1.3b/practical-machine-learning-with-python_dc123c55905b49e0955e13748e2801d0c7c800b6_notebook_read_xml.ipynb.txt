    The code you provided is already clean and does not contain any unnecessary or redundant lines. The function `read_xml` and `read_xml2dict_xml` are well-written and do not contain any unnecessary operations. However, if you want to remove the unnecessary lines, you can do so by commenting them out or removing them.

    Here is the code without the unnecessary lines:

    ```python
    def read_xml(file_name):
        try:
            tree = ET.parse(file_name)
            root = tree.getroot()
            print("Root tag:{0}".format(root.tag))
            print("Attributes of Root:: {0}".format(root.attrib))
            print_xml_tree(root)
        except IOError:
            raise IOError("File path incorrect/ File not found")
        except Exception:
            raise

    def read_xml2dict_xml(file_name):
        try:
            xml_filedata = open(file_name).read() 
            ordered_dict = xmltodict.parse(xml_filedata)
            print_nested_dicts(ordered_dict)
        except IOError:
            raise IOError("File path incorrect/ File not found")
        except ValueError:
            ValueError("XML file has errors")
        except Exception:
            raise 
    ```

    Please note that the `read_xml2dict_xml` function is not used in the provided code. If you want to use it, you need to define it according to your needs.
