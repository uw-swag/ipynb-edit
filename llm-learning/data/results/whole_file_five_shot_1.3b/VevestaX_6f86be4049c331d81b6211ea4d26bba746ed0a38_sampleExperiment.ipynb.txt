    The commit message "changed the files" suggests that the files used in the code have been modified. This could be due to changes in the data, the features engineered, or the variables tracked. 

    The code is reading a CSV file, extracting features, and tracking variables. The features are then engineered and the variables are tracked. The data is then dumped to an Excel file for future reference.

    The code also includes the use of the vevesta library, which is a tool for tracking the progress of machine learning experiments. The vevesta library is used to track the features engineered, the datasourcing, and the variables tracked.

    The final part of the code is reading the Excel file created by the vevesta library to display the data.

    The commit message "changed the files" is a good practice as it indicates that the code has been modified, and it provides a clear indication of what has been changed.

    However, the original code you provided is not complete and does not include the use of the vevesta library. The vevesta library is used to track the progress of machine learning experiments, but it is not included in the original code.

    If the vevesta library is used, the code would be more complex and would require additional steps to be included in the original code.

    Please note that the vevesta library is not available in the Python environment you are using. You may need to install it using pip or conda.
