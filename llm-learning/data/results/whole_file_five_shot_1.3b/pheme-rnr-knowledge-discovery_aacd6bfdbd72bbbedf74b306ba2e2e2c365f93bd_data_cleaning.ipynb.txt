    The code is written in Python and uses libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. The operations are performed on a dataset related to social media threads.

    The code also includes operations for standardizing and normalizing data, applying PCA, TSNE, and Isomap for dimensionality reduction, and testing different machine learning models.
