    The notebooks you've provided are used for data analysis and model training. However, you've mentioned that you want to delete them. 

    If you want to delete them, you can simply remove the code blocks from your notebooks. Here's how you can do it:

    ```python
    from deepchecks.tabular import Dataset
    from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    import pandas as pd
    from deepchecks.tabular.checks.performance import ConfusionMatrixReport

    iris = load_iris(as_frame=True)
    clf = AdaBoostClassifier()
    frame = iris.frame
    X = iris.data
    y = iris.target
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=42)
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    ds = Dataset(pd.concat([X_test, y_test], axis=1), 
                features=iris.feature_names,
                label='target')
    check = ConfusionMatrixReport()
    check.run(ds, clf)
    ```

    This code will run the AdaBoost classifier on the iris dataset, create a dataset with the test data and labels, and then run the ConfusionMatrixReport check.

    Please note that you need to have the necessary libraries installed and imported. If you're using a Jupyter notebook, you can run this code directly in the notebook. If you're using a Python script, you'll need to run this code in a Python environment.
