```python
    # The code above is a sample of how to use the OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo model to generate a response.
    # The function `get_completion` is used to generate a response to a given prompt.
    # The response is then printed out.

    # Please note that you need to replace `"Explain why Thailand is such as good place to retire."` with your own prompt.

    # Also, please make sure to replace `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

    # Finally, please note that the GPT-3.5-Turbo model may not always generate accurate responses, especially for complex or specific prompts.

    # You can also try other models like GPT-4, and see how they perform.

    # Remember to install the necessary libraries by running `!pip install openai` in your Jupyter notebook.

    # Also, please note that the GPT-3.5-Turbo model is a powerful tool, but it's also a bit expensive.

    # You can learn more about the GPT-3.5-Turbo model and its limitations in the OpenAI's GPT-3 model's documentation.
