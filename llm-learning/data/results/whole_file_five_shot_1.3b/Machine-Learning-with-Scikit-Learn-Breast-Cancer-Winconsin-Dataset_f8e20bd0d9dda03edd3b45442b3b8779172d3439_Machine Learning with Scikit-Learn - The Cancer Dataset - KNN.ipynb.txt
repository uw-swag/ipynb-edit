```python
    from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor

    # Initialize KNN model
    knn = KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=3)

    # Fit the model
    knn.fit(Xtr, ytr)

    # Predict the ratings
    y_pred = knn.predict(Xtst)

    # Calculate the accuracy
    accuracy = knn.score(Xtst, ytst)

    print('KNN model accuracy: ', accuracy)
    ```
