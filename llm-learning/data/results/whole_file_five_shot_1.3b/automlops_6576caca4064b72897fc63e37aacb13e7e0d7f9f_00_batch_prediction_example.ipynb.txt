    ## Documentation

    This notebook provides a comprehensive guide on how to use the state bucket functionality in Google Cloud AutoML. The state bucket is a feature that allows you to store and retrieve data in a Google Cloud Storage bucket.

    ## State Bucket Functionality

    The state bucket functionality in Google Cloud AutoML allows you to store and retrieve data in a Google Cloud Storage bucket. This is useful for storing intermediate results, such as predictions, that you may need to use later for further processing.

    ## Installation

    To use the state bucket functionality in Google Cloud AutoML, you need to install the `google-cloud-automlops` library. You can do this by running the following command in your Jupyter notebook:

    ```python
    !pip3 install google-cloud-automlops --user
    ```

    ## Usage

    The usage of the state bucket functionality in Google Cloud AutoML is straightforward. You can use the `AutoMLOps.component` decorator to define a function that runs a batch prediction job. This function takes several parameters, including the project ID, the BQ destination, the BQ dataset path, the instances format, the predictions format, the model resource name, the endpoint resource name, the machine type, the accelerator count, the accelerator type, the maximum replica count, and the starting replica count.

    The `AutoMLOps.pipeline` decorator is used to define a pipeline. A pipeline is a group of tasks that are executed in sequence. The pipeline parameters are passed to the `AutoMLOps.generate` and `AutoMLOps.deploy` methods to control the execution of the pipeline.

    The `AutoMLOps.provision` and `AutoMLOps.deploy` methods are used to provision and deploy the pipeline respectively.

    ## Examples

    The examples provided in this notebook are examples of how to use the state bucket functionality in Google Cloud AutoML.

    ## Troubleshooting

    If you encounter any issues while using the state bucket functionality in Google Cloud AutoML, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/automl/docs/state-bucket) for troubleshooting.
