The code you've provided is a part of a larger codebase and it's not clear what the purpose of this code is. However, I can provide a brief explanation of what's happening in the code.

The code is defining a class `DatasetSizeComparison` that extends the `TrainTestCheck` class from the `deepchecks` library. The `run_logic` method is overridden to compare the sizes of the train and test datasets.

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. The `DatasetSizeComparison` class is defined with a `run_logic` method. This method is called when the check is run.

2. The `run_logic` method retrieves the sizes of the train and test datasets from the context.

3. The sizes are stored in a dictionary and converted to a pandas DataFrame for easier display.

4. A function `graph_display` is defined to create a bar graph of the sizes.

5. The `run_logic` method returns a `CheckResult` object, which contains the results of the check and the display function.

6. The `DatasetSizeComparison` class is then used to run the check on a train and test dataset.

Please note that the code you've provided is incomplete and may not work as expected. It's recommended to provide more context or details about the purpose of the code.
