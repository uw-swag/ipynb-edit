    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook that uses the DeepChecks library to perform a performance check on a logistic regression model. The performance check is a type of check that evaluates the model's performance on a dataset.

    The code first imports necessary libraries and loads the iris dataset. It then creates a logistic regression model and a dataset from the iris dataset.

    The `RocReport` check is then run on the dataset and the logistic regression model. The `RocReport` check is a type of check that evaluates the model's performance on a dataset. It computes the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and presents it in a graphical form.

    The `run` method of the `RocReport` check takes two arguments: the dataset to be checked and the model to be evaluated. It returns a report of the performance of the model on the dataset.

    The `custom_formatwarning` function is a custom function that ignores all warnings except the message. This is done to prevent the notebook from crashing when a warning is raised.

    The `warnings.formatwarning` is then set to use the `custom_formatwarning` function to ignore all warnings.

    Finally, the `run` method of the `RocReport` check is called to perform the performance check on the dataset and the logistic regression model.

    The result of the performance check is then displayed in a graphical form.
