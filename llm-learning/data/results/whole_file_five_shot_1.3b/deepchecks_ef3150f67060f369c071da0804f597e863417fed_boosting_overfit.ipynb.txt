    The code provided is an example of how to update the examples in a Jupyter notebook. The examples are updated to include new data, new features, or to reflect changes in the code.

    The code is reading in a dataset from a UCI Machine Learning Repository, and then using a label encoder to transform all categorical columns in the dataset. The label encoder is used to convert the target column into a numerical value.

    The code then uses the AdaBoostClassifier from sklearn to train a model on the dataset. The model is then run through a check to see if the model is overfitting.

    The updated examples include the new data, new features, and the changes in the code.

    The updated examples are then displayed in a Jupyter notebook.

    The updated examples are saved in the commit message "[Automatic] Examples Update (#311)".

    The commit message is automatically generated based on the changes made to the code.

    The commit message is a reminder of the changes made to the code, and it's a good practice to include it in your commit messages.

    The commit message is also a reminder of the changes made to the code, and it's a good practice to include it in your commit messages.
