    # Homework 8:
    # 1. Implement a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with the squares of the numbers.
    # 2. Implement a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with the cubes of the numbers.
    # 3. Implement a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with the fourth power of the numbers.
    # 4. Implement a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with the square root of the numbers.
    # 5. Implement a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with the factorial of the numbers.
    # 6. Implement a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with the sum of the numbers.
    # 7. Implement a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with the average of the numbers.
    ```

    ### Solution:
    ```python
    # 1.
    def square_numbers(numbers):
        return [num ** 2 for num in numbers]

    # 2.
    def cube_numbers(numbers):
        return [num ** 3 for num in numbers]

    # 3.
    def fourth_power(numbers):
        return [num ** 4 for num in numbers]

    # 4.
    def square_root(numbers):
        return [num ** 0.5 for num in numbers]

    # 5.
    def factorial(numbers):
        return [math.factorial(num) for num in numbers]

    # 6.
    def sum_numbers(numbers):
        return [sum(numbers) for num in numbers]

    # 7.
    def average_numbers(numbers):
        return [sum(numbers) / len(numbers) for num in numbers]
    ```
