    The code you provided is a demonstration of how to use the Deepchecks library to evaluate the performance of an AdaBoost classifier on the Iris dataset.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The first part imports the necessary libraries and modules.
    - The second part loads the Iris dataset and splits it into a training set and a test set.
    - The third part creates a Dataset object for the training set and a test set.
    - The fourth part fits the AdaBoost classifier to the training set.
    - The second part of the code creates a ClassPerformance check and runs it on the test set.
    - The third part creates a custom scorer and uses it to evaluate the performance of the classifier.

    The output of the last part of the code will provide a detailed report of the performance of the AdaBoost classifier on the Iris dataset.

    Please note that the Deepchecks library is a part of the Deepchecks project, which is a collection of tools and libraries for data science.
