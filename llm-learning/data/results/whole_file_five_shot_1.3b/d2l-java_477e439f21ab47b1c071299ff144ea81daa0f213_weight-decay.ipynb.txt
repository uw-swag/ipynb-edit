    The commit message "Upgrade to djl 0.13.0 (#176)" is a direct update to the djl library version 0.13.0. The change includes the upgrade to the latest version of the library, which includes several improvements and bug fixes.

    The code cells in the commit message are related to the upgrade of the djl library. The first cell is a code cell that imports the necessary libraries and modules. The next cell is a cell that defines a class `MySentenceCollection` that is used to iterate over the sentences in a file. The next cell is a cell that defines a function `loadArray` that is used to load the data from a file into an `ArrayDataset`. The next cell is a cell that defines a class `InitParams` that is used to initialize the weights and biases of the model. The next cell is a cell that defines a function `l2Penalty` that is used to compute the L2 penalty term in the loss function. The next cell is a cell that defines a function `train` that is used to train the model. The next cell is a cell that defines a function `train_djl` that is used to train the model with weight decay. The last cell is a cell that defines a function `render` that is used to render the data.

    The commit message is a good example of how to update the code to a new version of a library.
