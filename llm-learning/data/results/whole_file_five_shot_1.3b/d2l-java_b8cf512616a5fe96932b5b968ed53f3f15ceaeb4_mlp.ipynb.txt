    The code you provided is a series of commands to initialize a new project, load a library, and perform some operations on a data set. Here's a brief explanation of what each part of the code does:

    1. `%maven ai.djl:api:0.8.0`: This command is used to add the AI Deep Java Library (DJL) to your Maven project. DJL is a machine learning library for Java that provides a high-level API for building and training machine learning models.

    2. `%maven org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.26`: This command is used to add the SLF4J API to your Maven project. SLF4J is a logging framework that provides a simple API for logging events.

    3. `%maven org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:1.7.26`: This command is used to add the SLF4J Simple implementation to your Maven project.

    4. `%maven ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-engine:0.8.0`: This command is used to add the MXNet engine to your Maven project. MXNet is a deep learning framework that provides a high-level API for building and training machine learning models.

    5. `%maven ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-native-auto:1.7.0-backport`: This command is used to add the MXNet Native Auto to your Maven project. MXNet Native Auto is a MXNet's native backend that provides a high-performance implementation of MXNet's core algorithms.

    6. `%load ../utils/plot-utils.ipynb`: This command is used to load the `plot-utils.ipynb` notebook.

    7. `import ai.djl.*;`: This line imports the AI Deep Java Library (DJL) and the necessary classes from the DJL.

    8. `import ai.djl.engine.*;`: This line imports the Engine class from the DJL.

    9. `import ai.djl.ndarray.*;`: This line
