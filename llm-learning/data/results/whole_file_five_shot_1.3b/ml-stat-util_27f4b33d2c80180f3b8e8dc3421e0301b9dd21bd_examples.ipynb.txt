    ## Example Use Cases

    This notebook provides examples of how to use various features of the library.

    - Loading and viewing images: The notebook demonstrates how to load images from a directory, resize them, and display them.

    - Image transformation: The notebook demonstrates how to apply various image transformations, such as resizing, converting to grayscale, and converting to a tensor.

    - Model training: The notebook demonstrates how to train a model using a dataset, such as the CIFAR-10 dataset.

    - Model evaluation: The notebook demonstrates how to evaluate the performance of a trained model, such as the accuracy of a model on a validation set.

    - Model saving and loading: The notebook demonstrates how to save and load models, such as the trained model in this case.

    Please note that these examples are quite simplified and may not cover all the features of the library.
