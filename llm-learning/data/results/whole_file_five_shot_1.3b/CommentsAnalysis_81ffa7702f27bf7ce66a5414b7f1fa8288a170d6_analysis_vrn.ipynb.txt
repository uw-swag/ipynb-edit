    ## New Notebook

    This notebook introduces the concept of machine learning and its applications in data science. It covers the basics of supervised and unsupervised learning, and how to use different machine learning algorithms.

    The notebook also includes practical examples of how to implement these algorithms in Python using libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy.

    The notebook is divided into several sections, each covering a different aspect of machine learning. The first section introduces the basics of machine learning, including the definition, types, and applications of machine learning. The second section covers supervised learning, including linear regression, logistic regression, and support vector machines. The third section covers unsupervised learning, including clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.

    The notebook also includes practical examples of how to implement these algorithms in Python using libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy.

    The notebook is designed to be interactive, allowing you to experiment with different algorithms and parameters to see how they affect the results.

    The notebook is also equipped with a discussion section at the end, where you can ask questions and get feedback on the material.

    The notebook is designed to be a hands-on introduction to machine learning, but it can also be used as a reference for anyone learning machine learning.

    The notebook is available in PDF format.

    The notebook is available on GitHub at: https://github.com/mlbookcamp/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/chapter-03-churn-prediction
