    This is a simple example of a Lwt-based OCaml Iocaml kernel. It uses the Lwt and Lwt_unix libraries to create a simple animation of a ball bouncing off a paddle.

    The ball is represented as a cairo surface, which is then converted to a PNG image and sent to the Iocaml kernel for display.

    The animation is created by a recursive function that updates the position of the ball and redraws the surface at each frame.

    The Lwt and Lwt_unix libraries are used to handle asynchronous operations in OCaml, which is necessary for the animation to run smoothly.

    ## Examples

    Here is an example of how to run the animation:

    ```
    ./run.sh
    ```

    This will start the Iocaml kernel, and the animation will be displayed in your default web browser.
