    The commit message "bump of D2L Java book version to 0.8.0 (#58)" indicates a change in the version of the D2L Java book. This could be a result of a new release or an update to the book's content.

    The code cells in the commit message are related to the version of the D2L Java book being used. The first cell is a Maven repository URL, which is used to store the Maven dependencies. The next few cells are Maven commands that are used to load dependencies, load Java files, and load IPython notebooks.

    The last cell is a Java code snippet that uses the D2L Java book's API to train a neural network on a dataset. The code includes import statements, class definitions, and method implementations.

    The code also includes a method to calculate the ReLU activation function, a method to calculate the net function, a loss function, and a training loop. The training loop includes a loop to calculate the loss and accuracy, and a loop to update the parameters.

    The code also includes a table rendering of the loss and accuracy over epochs, and a line plot of the loss over epochs.

    The commit message also mentions a "D2L" (Data-Driven Engineering for Learning) book, which is a book on data-driven engineering. The book is used to explain how to use AI and machine learning techniques to analyze and interpret data.
