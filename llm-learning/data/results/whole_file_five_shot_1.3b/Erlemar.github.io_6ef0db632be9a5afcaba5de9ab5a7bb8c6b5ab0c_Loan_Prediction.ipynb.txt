    The code you've provided is quite readable and well-structured. However, there are a few areas that could be improved for better readability and maintainability. 

    1. The code is quite long and complex, which makes it hard to understand. It's recommended to break down the code into smaller, more manageable functions or modules.
    
    2. The variable names are not descriptive enough. It's better to use meaningful names for variables and functions.
    
    3. The code is using the `linspace` function, which is not a standard function in numpy. It's better to use `np.linspace` for generating evenly spaced values.
    
    4. The code is using the `log1p` function, which is not a standard function in numpy. It's better to use `np.log1p` for computing the natural logarithm of 1 plus the input array.

    Please note that these are just suggestions and the actual improvement would depend on the specific context and requirements of your project.
