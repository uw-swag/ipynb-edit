The code you provided is mostly correct, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed.

1. The `OneVsRestClassifier` from `sklearn.multiclass` is used, but it's not clear from the code you provided which version of `OneVsRestClassifier` to use. The `OneVsRestClassifier` is a classifier that trains a classifier for each class, and then aggregates the results. The `OneVsRestClassifier` is used when you have a multi-class classification problem and you want to train a classifier for each class.

2. The `label_binarize` function is used to convert the multiclass classification problem into a binary classification problem. This function converts the multiclass labels into a binary format.

3. The `roc_curve` and `precision_recall_curve` functions from `sklearn.metrics` are used to plot the ROC and precision-recall curves, but they are not defined in the code you provided. You need to import these functions from `sklearn.metrics`.

4. The `plot_roc_curve`, `plot_precision_recall_curve` functions are used to plot the ROC and precision-recall curves, but they are not defined in the code you provided. You need to import these functions from `sklearn.metrics`.

5. The `train_test_split` function is used to split the data into a training set and a test set, but it's not clear from the code you provided which random state to use.

6. The `train_test_split` function is used to split the data into a training set and a test set, but it's not clear from the code you provided which random state to use.

7. The `roc_curve`, `precision_recall_curve` functions are used to plot the ROC and precision-recall curves, but they are not defined in the code you provided. You need to import these functions from `sklearn.metrics`.
