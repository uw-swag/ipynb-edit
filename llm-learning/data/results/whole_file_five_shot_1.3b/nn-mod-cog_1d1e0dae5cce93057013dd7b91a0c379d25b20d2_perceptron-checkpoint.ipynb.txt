    ## Perceptron

    This is a simple implementation of a Perceptron in Python using the Jupyter notebook.

    ## Installation

    You can install the Perceptron library using pip:

    ```
    pip install perceptron
    ```

    ## Usage

    Here is a simple usage example:

    ```python
    from perceptron import Perceptron

    # Create a Perceptron instance
    perceptron = Perceptron(eta=0.01, epochs=10)

    # Train the Perceptron
    perceptron.train([(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)])

    # Predict the output
    print(perceptron.predict([1, 0]))
    ```

    This will output:

    ```
    [1]
    ```
