The code you provided is a Python script that uses the pandas, sklearn, and deepchecks libraries to load a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, preprocess the data, and then perform a dataset drift check using the deepchecks library.

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file, and the 'adult' column is used as the label. The script then encodes categorical features and splits the data into a training set and a test set.

The script then creates a dataset object for both the training and test sets, and uses the 'WholeDatasetDrift' check from the deepchecks library to perform a dataset drift check.

The 'WholeDatasetDrift' check is used to check if the entire dataset is drifting. If the entire dataset is drifting, it means that the data in the dataset is not stationary and is likely to change over time.

The script then samples a small portion of the data for training and testing, and creates new dataset objects for these samples.

Finally, the 'WholeDatasetDrift' check is run on the new dataset objects, which will provide a report of the drift in the entire dataset.

The report will provide information about the drift, such as the number of samples that are drifting, the overall drift value, and the drift value for each feature.

The script ends with a few cells that are not included in the original code you provided.
