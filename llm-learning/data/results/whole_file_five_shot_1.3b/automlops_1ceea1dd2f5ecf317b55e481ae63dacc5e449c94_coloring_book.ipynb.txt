    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook written in Python using the KFP (Google Cloud Pipelines) library. It includes several components for data processing, model training, and model deployment.

    The components are:
    1. `create_dataset`: This component reads data from a BigQuery table and writes it to a CSV file in Google Cloud Storage.
    2. `train_model`: This component trains a decision tree model on the data.
    3. `deploy_model`: This component deploys the trained model to Google Cloud AI Platform.

    The pipeline is defined in the last cell of the notebook.

    Please note that the code you provided is a part of a larger pipeline, and it's not running. You need to run the pipeline to see the results.
