    The code you provided is a mix of Python code and Jupyter notebook cells. It includes import statements, function definitions, and cell outputs. However, it seems like the code is not formatted properly. Here's a corrected version of your code:

    ```python
    #@title Authorization Form
    ACCOUNT_ID = "ACCOUNT_ID" #@param {type:"string"}
    AUTH_TOKEN = "AUTH_TOKEN" #@param {type:"string"}
    MATERIALS_PROJECT_API_KEY = "MATERIALS_PROJECT_API_KEY" #@param {type:"string"}
    ORGANIZATION_ID  = "ORGANIZATION_ID" #@param {type:"string"}

    import os
    if "COLAB_JUPYTER_IP" in os.environ:
        os.environ.update(
            dict(
                ACCOUNT_ID=ACCOUNT_ID,
                AUTH_TOKEN=AUTH_TOKEN,
                MATERIALS_PROJECT_API_KEY=MATERIALS_PROJECT_API_KEY,
                ORGANIZATION_ID=ORGANIZATION_ID,
            )
        )

    # Common imports
    import numpy as np

    # To plot pretty figures
    %matplotlib inline

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.rcParams['axes.labelsize'] = 14
    plt.rcParams['xtick.labelsize'] = 12
    plt.rcParams['ytick.labelsize'] = 12
