    The code you provided seems to be correct. The `DateTrainValidationLeakageDuplicates` and `DateTrainValidationLeakageOverlap` checks are used to detect and handle date leakage in your dataset. 

    The `DateTrainValidationLeakageDuplicates` check will detect and remove duplicates in the training dataset, while the `DateTrainValidationLeakageOverlap` check will detect and remove overlapping dates in the training dataset.

    However, the `CheckSuite` function is used to run all the checks in a single step. If you want to run each check separately, you can use the `run` method of the `CheckSuite` object.
