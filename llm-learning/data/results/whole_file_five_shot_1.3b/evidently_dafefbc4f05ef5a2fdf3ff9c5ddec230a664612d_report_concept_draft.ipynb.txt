    The error message you're seeing is because the `probability_distribution` function from the `evidently` library is used with wrong data. The function expects a 2D numpy array or a pandas DataFrame with two columns: 'probability' and 'distribution'. If the data is not in the correct format, the function will raise an error.

    To fix this error, you need to ensure that your data is in the correct format. You can do this by using the `pd.DataFrame` function to create a DataFrame from your data, and then passing this DataFrame to the `probability_distribution` function.

    Here's an example of how you can do this:

    ```python
    df = pd.DataFrame(data=adult_cur.iloc[:2000, 3:5], columns=['probability', 'distribution'])
    df['probability_distribution'] = evidently.utils.probability_distribution(df['probability'], df['distribution'])
    ```

    This will create a new column 'probability_distribution' in your DataFrame, which is a 2D numpy array with the same shape as your data.

    If you're still getting an error, please provide the data you're using and the specific error message you're seeing.
