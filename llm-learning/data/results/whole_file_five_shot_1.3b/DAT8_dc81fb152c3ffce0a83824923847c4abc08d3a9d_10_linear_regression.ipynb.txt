    The solution to the problem is to add a new cell at the end of the linear regression notebook. This cell should include the following code:

    ```python
    # print the coefficients
    print linreg.intercept_
    print linreg.coef_
    ```

    This will print the intercept and coefficients of the linear regression model, which can be used to make predictions.
