The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook and it's about removing a label from a dataset. The label_name is a parameter that is used in the Dataset constructor to specify the name of the label column. If you want to remove it, you can simply remove the label_name parameter from the Dataset constructor. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from deepchecks import Dataset

# Remove label_name from dataset constructor
ds_train = Dataset(df_train.drop(label_col, axis=1), label_name=None, cat_features=[], set_index_from_dataframe_index=False)
ds_test =  Dataset(df_test.drop(label_col, axis=1), label_name=None, cat_features=[])
```

In this code, the label_name parameter is set to None, which means that the label column will not be included in the dataset. The cat_features parameter is also set to an empty list, which means that the categorical features will not be included in the dataset.

After these changes, you can run the suite as before:

```python
customized_suite.run(ds_train, ds_test, rf_clf)
```

This will run the suite with the updated dataset, and the suite will not include the label column in the performance report.
