    The code you provided is a demonstration of how to use the Deepchecks library to compare the performance of different models. 

    The `SimpleModelComparison` check is used to compare the performance of different models. The `simple_model_type` parameter can be set to 'random', 'constant', or 'tree'. 

    The 'random' model is a model that makes random predictions. The 'constant' model is a model that always predicts the same class. The 'tree' model is a model that uses a decision tree.

    The `add_condition_gain_not_less_than` method is used to add a condition that ensures the gain of the model is not less than a certain value. In this case, it ensures the gain of the model is not less than 0.2.

    The `run` method is used to run the check and print the results.

    Please note that the code provided is a demonstration and may not work as expected. It is recommended to use the Deepchecks library for more complex model comparisons.
