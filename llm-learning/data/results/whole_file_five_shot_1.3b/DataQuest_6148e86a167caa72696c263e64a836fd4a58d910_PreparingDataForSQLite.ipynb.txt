    The code you've provided is a mix of Python and SQL, and it seems to be a merge conflict. The code is trying to read a CSV file, which is not a recognized format. The code also tries to read a SQLite database, which is not a recognized format.

    The best solution would be to fix the format of the CSV file and the SQLite database. You can use Python's pandas library to read the CSV file, and SQLite3 to read the SQLite database.

    Here is a sample code to read a CSV file:

    ```python
    df = pd.read_csv('file.csv', encoding='ISO-8859-1')
    ```

    And here is a sample code to read a SQLite database:

    ```python
    conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
    df = pd.read_sql_query(q2, conn)
    conn.close()
    ```

    Please replace 'file.csv' and 'database.db' with your actual file names.
