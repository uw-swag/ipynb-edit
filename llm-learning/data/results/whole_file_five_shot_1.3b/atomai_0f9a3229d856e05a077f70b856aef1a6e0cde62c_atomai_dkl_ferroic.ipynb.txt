    The code you've provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the AtomAI library to perform a specific task. AtomAI is a machine learning library for atom-based data, specifically for the analysis of polarization data.

    The notebook includes the following sections:

    1. Installing the necessary libraries.
    2. Using the GPU for computations.
    3. Loading and visualizing the dataset.
    4. Extracting features from the dataset.
    5. Training a DKL-GPR model on the dataset.
    6. Making predictions and visualizing the results.
    7. Splitting the dataset and training a new model.
    8. Visualizing the results of the split.
    9. Annotating the plots for better understanding.

    The notebook is designed to be interactive and allows for easy modification of the code and the parameters of the models.

    The notebook is a good example of how to use the AtomAI library to perform machine learning tasks on atom-based data.
