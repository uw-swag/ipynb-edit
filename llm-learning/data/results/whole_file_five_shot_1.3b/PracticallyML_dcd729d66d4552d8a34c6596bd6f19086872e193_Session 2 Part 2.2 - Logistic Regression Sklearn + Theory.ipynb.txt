    This code adds a new class `LogisticRegressionWithL2` that inherits from `sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` and overrides the `fit` method to apply L2 regularization. The regularization strength `C` is set to `1.0 / l1_ratio`, where `l1_ratio` is the inverse of the regularization strength.
