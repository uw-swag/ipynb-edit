```python
    # Assuming you have a function to calculate data quality metrics
    def calculate_data_quality_metrics():
        # Implementation of data quality metrics calculation
        pass

    # Call the function to calculate data quality metrics
    calculate_data_quality_metrics()
    ```
    This function is a placeholder and should be replaced with the actual implementation of the data quality metrics calculation.
