    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses various Python libraries to perform various tasks such as data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. Here's a brief overview of what each section does:

    1. **Imports**: This section imports necessary libraries for data analysis and machine learning.

    2. **Data Import**: This section imports the training and test datasets.

    3. **Data Information**: This section prints out the information of the training and test datasets.

    4. **Data Preprocessing**: This section preprocesses the data by handling missing values, outliers, and skewed metrics.

    5. **Feature Engineering**: This section creates new features from the existing ones.

    6. **Model Training**: This section trains a Ridge regression model and a Random Forest model.

    7. **Model Evaluation**: This section evaluates the performance of the models.

    8. **Feature Selection**: This section selects the most and least relevant features for the house price prediction.

    9. **Prediction**: This section makes predictions on the test dataset and saves them to a CSV file.

    The code is structured in a way that makes it easy to follow along with the tutorial. Each section is well-commented to explain what it does.

    Please note that the code provided is a skeleton and may need to be adjusted to fit your specific needs.
