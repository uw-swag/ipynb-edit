    The code is setting the batch size to 1 in the DQNAgent class. This means that the agent will only use one sample from its memory at a time to train. This is a common practice in reinforcement learning to speed up training. However, it's important to note that setting the batch size to 1 can lead to instability if the agent's policy is not properly defined.

    The code also uses the `pdb.set_trace()` function to pause the execution of the code and allow you to inspect the variables at that point in time. This can be useful for debugging and understanding the state of the program.

    The code also uses the `resource` module to print the current memory usage of the program. This can be useful for debugging memory usage issues.

    The code also uses the `gym` module to create an environment for the agent to learn from. This can be useful for debugging and understanding the environment's state space and action space.

    The code also uses the `pympler` module to track memory usage. This can be useful for debugging memory usage issues.

    The code also uses the `keras` module to build and train a deep learning model. This can be useful for debugging and understanding the model's architecture and training process.

    The code also uses the `numpy` module to perform mathematical operations. This can be useful for debugging and understanding the operations performed by the agent.

    The code also uses the `time` module to print the current time and date. This can be useful for debugging and understanding the execution time of the program.

    The code also uses the `os` module to create and manage directories. This can be useful for debugging and understanding the directory structure of the program.

    The code also uses the `random` module to generate random numbers. This can be useful for debugging and understanding the randomness used by the agent.

    The code also uses the `pdb` module to pause the execution of the code and allow you to inspect the variables at that point in time. This can be useful for debugging and understanding the state of the program.

    The code also uses the `gym` module to create an environment for the agent to learn from. This can be useful for debugging and understanding the environment's state space
