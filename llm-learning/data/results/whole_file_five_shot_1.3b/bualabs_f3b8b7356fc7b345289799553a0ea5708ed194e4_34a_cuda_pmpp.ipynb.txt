    The code you've provided is a set of Python code cells that are used to perform various operations on images and perform matrix multiplication on them. The operations include resizing the image, converting the image to grayscale, and performing matrix multiplication. The code also includes a block kernel description, which is a method used in parallel computing to perform computations in a more efficient way.

    However, the code you've provided is not complete and it seems to be incomplete or incomplete. It's missing some parts, such as the definition of the function `rgb2grey_k`, the definition of the function `matmul_bk`, and the loading of the CUDA module.

    Please provide the complete code so that I can help you better.
