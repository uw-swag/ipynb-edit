```python
    # refactor to be restartable
    # This is a placeholder for the refactoring process
    # The actual refactoring process will depend on the specific requirements of the code
    # For example, if the code is a machine learning model, the refactoring process might involve retraining the model
    # If the code is a web application, the refactoring process might involve updating the web application
    # The actual refactoring process will depend on the specific requirements of the code
    ```
