    The code you provided is a part of a Maven project that uses the Deep Java Library (DJL) to perform linear regression. The project is using Maven to manage dependencies, and it's also using the TableSaw library to visualize the data.

    The project is updating the version of the ai.djl:api and ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-engine dependencies to 0.7.0-SNAPSHOT. This is a snapshot version, which means that the API and the underlying libraries may not have been released yet.

    The project is also updating the version of the ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-native-auto dependency to 1.7.0-b. This is also a snapshot version, which means that the native-auto library may not have been released yet.

    The project is also updating the version of the tech.tablesaw:tablesaw-jsplot dependency to 0.38.1. This is a snapshot version, which means that the JSPlot library may not have been released yet.

    The project is also using the GradientCollector to compute the gradients and update the parameters. The learning rate is set to 0.03 and the number of epochs is set to 3.

    The project is also printing the error in estimating the weights and the bias. The error in estimating the weights is [0.0, 0.0] and the error in estimating the bias is 0.0.

    The project is also using the sgd function to update the parameters. The sgd function is a function that updates the parameters using their gradient.

    The project is also using the Engine to compute the gradients and update the parameters. The Engine is a class that computes the gradients and updates the parameters.

    The project is also using the Batch to get the features and labels. The Batch is a class that represents a batch of data.

    The project is also using the ArrayDataset to create a dataset. The ArrayDataset is a class that represents a dataset.

    The project is also using the linreg function to perform linear regression. The linreg function is a function that performs linear regression.

    The project is also using the squaredLoss function to
