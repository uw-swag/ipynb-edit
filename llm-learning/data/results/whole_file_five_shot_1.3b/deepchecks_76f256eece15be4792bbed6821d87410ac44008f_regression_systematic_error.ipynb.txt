    The code you provided is a demonstration of how to use the DeepChecks library to perform a regression systematic error check on a Gradient Boosting Regressor model.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The first part of the code imports the necessary libraries and modules.
    - The second part of the code loads the diabetes dataset from the sklearn library and splits it into a training set and a test set.
    - The third part of the code adds a constant value to the target variable in the training set to simulate a regression problem.
    - The fourth part of the code creates a Dataset object for the training and test sets.
    - The fifth part of the code trains a Gradient Boosting Regressor model on the training set.
    - The sixth part of the code creates a RegressionSystematicError check object.
    - The seventh part of the code runs the check on the test set and the trained model.

    The output of the seventh part of the code will provide a report of the systematic error of the model. This report will include the mean absolute error, mean squared error, and the percentage of data points that were predicted correctly.

    Please note that the DeepChecks library is a powerful tool for model validation and performance analysis, but it requires a good understanding of machine learning and data science concepts.
