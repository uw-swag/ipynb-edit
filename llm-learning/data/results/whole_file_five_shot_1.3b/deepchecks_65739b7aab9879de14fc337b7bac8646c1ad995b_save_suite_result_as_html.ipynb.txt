    The commit message "links-checks github action fix (#775)" is a fix for a GitHub action that was previously used to link the DeepChecks library. The action is used to run the suite of checks on the Iris dataset, and the results are saved as HTML files.

    The code provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook, and it's using the DeepChecks library to run a suite of checks on the Iris dataset. The suite includes several checks for data quality, consistency, and completeness. The results of these checks are saved as HTML files, which can be viewed in a web browser.

    The code also includes a line to remove the output files after the notebook has been run, to avoid any potential confusion or leaks.

    The commit message is clear and explains what the changes are, why they were made, and how they affect the functionality of the code.

    The code is well-structured and follows the best practices for writing GitHub actions.

    The GitHub action is used to ensure that the DeepChecks library is correctly installed and configured, and that the suite of checks is run correctly.

    The GitHub action is also used to ensure that the results of the checks are saved as HTML files, which can be viewed in a web browser.
