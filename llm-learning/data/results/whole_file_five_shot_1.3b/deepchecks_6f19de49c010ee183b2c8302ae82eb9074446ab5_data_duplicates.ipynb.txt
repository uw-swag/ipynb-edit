    The DataDuplicates check in Deepchecks is used to find duplicate rows in a dataset. It can be used to identify and remove duplicates, or to find duplicates in specific columns.

    Here's an example of how to use the DataDuplicates check:

    ```python
    from deepchecks.checks.integrity.data_duplicates import DataDuplicates
    from deepchecks.base import Dataset, Suite
    from datetime import datetime
    import pandas as pd

    ds = pd.DataFrame({"col1":[1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2], "col2":[1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2],"col3":[2,3,4,4,4,3,4,5,6,4]})

    DataDuplicates().run(ds)
    ```

    This will return a DataFrame with duplicate rows, and you can choose to remove them or keep them.

    The `DataDuplicates` class also allows you to specify the number of rows to show, the columns to consider for duplicates, and the columns to ignore.

    The `run` method of the `DataDuplicates` class will return a `Suite` object, which you can use to visualize the results.

    Please note that the `DataDuplicates` check is not available in the core Deepchecks library, you need to install it using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install deepchecks
    ```

    Also, please note that the `DataDuplicates` check is a part of the Deepchecks core library, and it may not be available in all environments or notebook environments.
