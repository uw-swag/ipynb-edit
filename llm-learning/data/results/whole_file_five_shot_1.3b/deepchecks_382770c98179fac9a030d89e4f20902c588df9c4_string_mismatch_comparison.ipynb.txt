    ### Response:
    In Python, string comparison is case-sensitive. This means that 'a' and 'A' are considered different strings.

    Here is an example:

    ```python
    str1 = "Hello"
    str2 = "hello"

    if str1 == str2:
        print("Strings are equal")
    else:
        print("Strings are not equal")
    ```

    This will output "Strings are not equal" because the comparison is case-sensitive.

    If you want to compare strings without considering their case, you can use the lower() or upper() functions in Python:

    ```python
    str1 = "Hello"
    str2 = "hello"

    if str1.lower() == str2.lower():
        print("Strings are equal")
    else:
        print("Strings are not equal")
    ```

    This will output "Strings are equal" because the comparison is not case-sensitive.
