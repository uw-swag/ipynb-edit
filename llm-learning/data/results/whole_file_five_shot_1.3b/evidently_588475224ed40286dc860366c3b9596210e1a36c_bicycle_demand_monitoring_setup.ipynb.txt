    The code you provided is a combination of several cells, each of which is responsible for a different task. Here's a brief explanation of what each cell does:

    1. `<Cell_0>`: This cell imports the necessary libraries and modules for the rest of the code. It also installs a new package called `evidently` if it's not already installed.

    2. `<Cell_1>`: This cell imports the necessary libraries and modules for the rest of the code. It also sets up the matplotlib plotting library and the IPython notebook's configuration.

    3. `<Cell_2>`: This cell imports the necessary libraries and modules for the rest of the code. It also sets up the matplotlib plotting library and the IPython notebook's configuration.

    4. `<Cell_3>`: This cell downloads the bike sharing dataset and loads it into a pandas DataFrame.

    5. `<Cell_4>`: This cell converts the 'dteday' column to datetime format.

    6. `<Cell_5>`: This cell displays the first few rows of the DataFrame.

    7. `<Cell_6>`: This cell defines the target variable and the features to be used for prediction.

    8. `<Cell_7>`: This cell splits the data into a training set and a test set.

    9. `<Cell_8>`: This cell creates a RandomForestRegressor model and fits it to the training data.

    10. `<Cell_9>`: This cell creates a column mapping object.

    11. `<Cell_10>`: This cell fits the model to the training data.

    12. `<Cell_11>`: This cell makes predictions on the training and test sets.

    13. `<Cell_12>`: This cell creates a column mapping object.

    14. `<Cell_13>`: This cell makes predictions on the training data.

    15. `<Cell_14>`: This cell creates a column mapping object.

    16. `<Cell_15>`: This cell makes predictions on the current data.
