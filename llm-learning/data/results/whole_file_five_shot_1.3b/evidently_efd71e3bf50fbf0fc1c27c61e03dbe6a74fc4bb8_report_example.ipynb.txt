    Commit Message: "Implemented the function to generate reports. (#299)"
    Original Code Cells:
    '''
    def generate_reports(self, data, report_type):
        pass
    '''
    ]

    ### Response:
    The function `generate_reports` is implemented in the class `DataProcessor`. It takes two parameters: `data` and `report_type`. The function is a placeholder and does nothing. It's expected to be implemented in a subclass of `DataProcessor` to generate different types of reports based on the `report_type` parameter.
