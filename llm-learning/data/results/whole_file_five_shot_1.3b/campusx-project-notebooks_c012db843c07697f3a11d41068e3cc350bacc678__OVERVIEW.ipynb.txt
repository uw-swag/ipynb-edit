    # Overview of the Gurgaon 10K dataset

    The Gurgaon 10K dataset is a large-scale dataset of images, which is used for training various image classification models. The dataset contains 10,000 images of various objects, each with a corresponding label.

    The dataset is divided into three subsets:

    1. Training set: This subset contains 8,000 images.
    2. Validation set: This subset contains 1,000 images.
    3. Test set: This subset contains 1,000 images.

    The images are of varying sizes and resolutions, and the labels are the objects they represent.

    The dataset is widely used in the field of computer vision for training various image classification models.

    ## Code Explanation

    The code begins by importing the necessary libraries. It then loads the Gurgaon 10K dataset from the specified paths. The dataset is then split into training, validation, and test sets. The training set is used to train the model, while the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters. The test set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

    The dataset is then preprocessed, which includes resizing the images to a fixed size and normalizing the pixel values. The preprocessing steps are applied to both the training and test sets.

    The preprocessed data is then used to train the model. The model is trained for a number of epochs, and the training process is monitored using TensorBoard.

    After training, the model is evaluated on the test set and the results are displayed.

    Finally, the model is saved for future use.

    ## Note

    The Gurgaon 10K dataset is a large-scale dataset, and it may take a while to load and preprocess the data.
