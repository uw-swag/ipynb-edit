    The code you provided is a demonstration of how to use the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check in the Deepchecks library. 

    The `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check is used to detect duplicates in the training and test datasets based on the 'col1' column. 

    In the first example, the check is run on the training dataset, which includes duplicates. The duplicates are identified based on the 'col1' column, and the check shows the top 3 duplicates for each column.

    In the second example, the check is run on the test dataset, which does not include any duplicates. The check does not identify any duplicates, and the result is an empty suite.

    The third example is a bit more complex. The test dataset includes duplicates, but the training dataset does not. The check identifies the duplicates based on the 'col1' column, and the result shows the top 3 duplicates for each column.

    Please note that the actual duplicates found by the check may not be the same as the duplicates identified in the examples.

    Also, the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check is a part of the Deepchecks library, and it's not a standalone function. You can use it in a suite by adding it to a suite and running it.
