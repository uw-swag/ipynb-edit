    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook. The cells are divided into three parts:

    1. The first part of the code is a function that creates a `Dataset` object from a dictionary. The dictionary contains two keys: 'col1', which is a list of datetime objects, and 'date_name', which is the name of the date column.

    2. The second part of the code creates two datasets, `train_ds` and `test_ds`, using the function `dataset_from_dict`. The `train_ds` dataset has duplicate rows, while the `test_ds` dataset does not.

    3. The third part of the code uses the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check to find and show duplicate rows in the `train_ds` dataset.

    The `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check is a methodology check that finds and shows duplicate rows in a dataset. It's used to detect and remove duplicates in the training dataset.

    The `run` method of the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check is used to execute the check on the `train_ds` dataset.

    The `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check is then used to find and show duplicate rows in the `test_ds` dataset.

    The `run` method of the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check is used to execute the check on the `test_ds` dataset.

    The `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check is then used to find and show duplicate rows in the `train_ds` dataset.

    The `run` method of the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check is used to execute the check on the `train_ds` dataset.

    The `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check is then used to find and show duplicate rows in the `test_ds` dataset.

    The `run` method of the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check is used to execute the check on the `test_ds` dataset.

    The `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check is then used to find
