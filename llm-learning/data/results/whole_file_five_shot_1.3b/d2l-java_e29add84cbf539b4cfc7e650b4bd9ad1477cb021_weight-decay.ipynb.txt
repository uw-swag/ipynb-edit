    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook, and it's using Apache DL4J (Deep Learning for Java) to train a simple linear regression model. The model is trained for 100 epochs with a learning rate of 0.003. The training loss and test loss are plotted using a line plot.

    The code is divided into several sections:

    1. Importing necessary libraries and classes.
    2. Defining the training parameters and data loading.
    3. Defining the loss function and the training loop.
    4. Training the model with different weight decay values.
    5. Plotting the training and test loss.

    The training process is done in the `train` and `train_djl` methods, which are defined in the `InitParams` and `train_djl` classes respectively. The `train` method uses the gradient collector to compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights, and the `train_djl` method uses the DJL's Trainer API to train the model.

    The weight decay parameter `wd` is used to add a penalty term to the loss function. The penalty term is the L2 norm of the weights, which is added to the standard L2 loss.

    The code also uses the DJL's Tracker and Optimizer APIs to set the learning rate, and the DJL's Model and Trainer APIs to define and train the model.

    The final part of the code plots the training and test loss.

    Please note that the code is written in Java, and it uses Apache DL4J for deep learning.
