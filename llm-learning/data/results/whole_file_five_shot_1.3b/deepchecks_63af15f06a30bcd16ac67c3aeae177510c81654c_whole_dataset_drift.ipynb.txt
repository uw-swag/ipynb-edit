    The code provided is a Python script that uses the deepchecks library to perform a drift check on a dataset. The drift check is performed on a subset of the data, which is randomly selected from the original data. The drift check is then run on the two subsets.

    The drift check is performed on the 'income' column, which is the label of the dataset. The 'income' column is categorical, and the 'sex' column is a continuous feature.

    The drift check is performed on a sample of 10,000 data points from the original dataset. The random seed is set to 0 for reproducibility.

    The drift check is run on the two subsets of data: a sample of 10,000 data points from the original dataset, and a sample of 5,000 data points from the original dataset, but only if the overall drift value is greater than a certain threshold.

    The drift check is run on the two datasets, and the results are displayed.
