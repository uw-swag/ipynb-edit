    The commit message "Upgrade to 0.11.0 (#139)" indicates that the version of the AI library DJL (Deep Java Library) is being updated to version 0.11.0. This is a significant change from the previous version, as the library has been updated to use the new API and features introduced in the 0.11.0 version.

    The code cells in the commit message are related to the upgrade of the AI library DJL to version 0.11.0. The first cell imports the necessary libraries and classes for the upgrade. The next cell creates a new class, CenteredLayer, which is a custom block for performing centered layer operations. The next cell defines a new linear layer with a custom activation function. The next cell initializes the parameters of the linear layer. The next cell creates a new SequentialBlock and adds the linear layer to it. The next cell predicts the output of the SequentialBlock. The next cell creates a new SequentialBlock and adds the linear layer to it. The next cell initializes the parameters of the SequentialBlock. The next cell creates a new SequentialBlock and adds the linear layer to it. The next cell predicts the output of the SequentialBlock.

    The commit message also mentions the use of the NoopTranslator, which is a simple translator that does nothing. This translator is used when the input and output shapes of the block are the same.

    The commit message also mentions the use of the XavierInitializer, which is a weight initialization method that uses a similar method to the Xavier initialization method used in the original Xavier initialization paper.

    The commit message also mentions the use of the ReLU activation function, which is a type of activation function that is used in the forward pass of a neural network.

    The commit message also mentions the use of the mean function, which is a mathematical operation that calculates the average of a set of numbers.

    The commit message also mentions the use of the dot function, which is a mathematical operation that computes the dot product of two vectors.

    The commit message also mentions the use of the add function, which is a mathematical operation that adds two numbers.

    The commit message also mentions the use of the relu function, which is a type of activation function that is
