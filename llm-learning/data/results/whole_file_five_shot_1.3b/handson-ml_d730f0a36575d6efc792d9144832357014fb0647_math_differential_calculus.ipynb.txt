    ## This notebook is an example of how to use the handson-ml2 library to create a machine learning model.
    ## The model is a simple linear regression model, but it can be used to create a more complex model.
    ## The notebook also includes a section on how to save figures, add a colab link, and improve the save_fig function.
    ## The notebook also includes a section on how to animate a function of a variable, and how to create a 3D plot.
