    ## Analysis Notebook

    # This notebook will contain the analysis of the models' performance.

    ## Model Performance

    # The performance of each model can be evaluated using various metrics such as:

    - Mean Squared Error (MSE): This measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.
    - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): This is the square root of the MSE.
    - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): This measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values.
    - R-Squared (RÂ²): This is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model.

    ## Model Comparison

    The performance of the models can be compared using these metrics. The model with the lowest MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R-Squared can be considered as the best model.

    ## Model Tuning

    The performance of the models can be further improved by tuning their parameters. This can be done using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.

    ## Conclusion

    The performance of the models can be summarized in the following way:

    - The model with the lowest MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R-Squared is the best model.
    - The model with the highest R-Squared is the most accurate model.
    - The model with the lowest MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R-Squared is the least complex model.

    ## Further Analysis

    Further analysis can be performed to understand the impact of the features used in the model, the nature of the data, and the problem at hand.
