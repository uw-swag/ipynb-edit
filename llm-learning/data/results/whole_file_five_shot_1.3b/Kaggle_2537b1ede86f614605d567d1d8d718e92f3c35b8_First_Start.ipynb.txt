    The code cells you provided are mostly for data analysis and visualization tasks. However, they are not complete and do not contain any code to be executed. They are just for demonstration purposes. 

    Here are some of the tasks you can perform with the code:

    1. Data Analysis: You can use pandas, numpy, and matplotlib to analyze the data. For example, you can calculate the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.

    2. Data Visualization: You can use seaborn or matplotlib to visualize the data. For example, you can create histograms, bar plots, scatter plots, etc.

    3. Machine Learning: You can use scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library, to build and train models.

    4. Deep Learning: You can use TensorFlow or PyTorch, a popular deep learning library, to build and train models.

    5. Web Scraping: You can use BeautifulSoup or Scrapy, a library for web scraping to extract data from websites.

    6. Web Development: You can use Flask or Django, a web framework to build web applications.

    7. Automation: You can use Python's built-in libraries like os, shutil, etc., to automate tasks.

    8. Testing: You can use unittest or pytest, a testing library to write tests for your code.

    9. Version Control: You can use Git, a distributed version control system, to manage your code.

    10. Documentation: You can use Sphinx, a tool for generating documentation from source code, to document your code.

    11. Presentation: You can use tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to create interactive plots for your presentation.

    12. Automation: You can use Python's built-in libraries like os, shutil, etc., to automate tasks.

    13. Testing: You can use unittest or pytest, a testing library to write tests for your code.

    14. Version Control: You can use Git, a distributed version control system, to manage your code.

    15. Documentation: You can use
