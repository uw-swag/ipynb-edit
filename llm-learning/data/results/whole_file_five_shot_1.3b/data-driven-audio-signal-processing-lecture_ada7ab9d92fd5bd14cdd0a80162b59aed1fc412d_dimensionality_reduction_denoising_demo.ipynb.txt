    The code you provided is a collection of Jupyter notebooks that perform various operations on audio data. The notebooks start with importing necessary libraries and functions, then generate a dataset with a linear relationship. The dataset is then mapped into a feature space using a transformation matrix. The notebook then plots the data in two dimensions for visualization. The notebook also calculates the SVD of the dataset and plots the scree plot. The notebook also calculates the normalized cumulative captured energy and plots it. The notebook then applies a gaussian noise to the dataset and re-runs the previous operations. The notebook also truncates the spectral decomposition of the dataset and re-runs the previous operations.

    However, the code you provided is not complete. It seems like the notebooks are meant to be run in a Jupyter notebook environment. The last cell of the notebook is incomplete and contains a code snippet that is not executable. The code snippet is supposed to be a function definition, but it is not. The function definition is missing the return statement.

    Here is the complete code for the last cell:

    ```python
    def truncated_spectral_decomposition(X, U, S, Vt, K):

        Xr = np.zeros_like(X)
        for r in range(K):
            Xr += S[r] * np.dot(np.expand_dims(U[:,r], axis=1),np.expand_dims(Vt[r,:], axis=0))
        
        return Xr
    ```

    The function `truncated_spectral_decomposition` is defined to truncate the spectral decomposition of a dataset. It takes as input the dataset, the U, S, Vt matrices from the SVD, and the number of components to keep. It then returns the truncated dataset.

    The last cell of the notebook is re-run with the function `truncated_spectral_decomposition` to perform the spectral decomposition on the dataset.

    Please note that the code you provided is a part of a larger project, and the notebooks are meant to be run in a Jupyter notebook environment. The last cell of the notebook is incomplete and contains a code snippet
