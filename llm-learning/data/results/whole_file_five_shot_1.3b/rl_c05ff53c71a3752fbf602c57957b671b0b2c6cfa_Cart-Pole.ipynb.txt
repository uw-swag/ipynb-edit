    ## Code Explanation

    The code provided is a reinforcement learning agent for the CartPole environment. The agent uses a policy gradient method to learn the optimal policy for the environment. The agent uses a deep neural network to model the policy, and the policy gradient method is used to update the policy. The agent also uses a custom loss function to encourage exploration of new actions.

    The code also includes a function to run the agent in an environment, and a function to plot the training progress of the agent.

    The code is divided into several sections, each of which is responsible for a specific task. For example, the `Agent` class is responsible for defining the structure of the agent, the `run_episode` function is responsible for running an episode of the agent, and the `rlplot` function is responsible for plotting the training progress of the agent.

    The code also includes a section for testing the agent's performance in different environments.

    The code is also divided into several functions, each of which is responsible for a specific task. For example, the `run_experiment` function is responsible for training the agent, and the `run_episode` function is responsible for running an episode of the agent.
