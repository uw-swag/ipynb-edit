    # Add Ch 5.6 GPUs (#11)
    # This commit adds the section related to GPUs to the code.

    # GPUs are a key component of modern computing systems, and they are used to process and store data.
    # In this section, we will discuss the concept of GPUs and how they are used in data processing.

    ## Section 5.6: GPUs

    # GPUs are a type of parallel computing device that can process data simultaneously. They are designed to perform computations at high speeds, which is crucial for many applications, including machine learning and data analysis.

    ## GPUs in Data Processing

    # Data processing involves the use of computers to analyze and interpret data. In this context, GPUs are used to process data in parallel, which can significantly speed up data analysis.

    ## Future Work

    # As more and more data is processed, the need for more powerful computers becomes increasingly important. GPUs are a promising solution to this problem. They can process large amounts of data more quickly than traditional computers, which can lead to significant improvements in data analysis and machine learning.
