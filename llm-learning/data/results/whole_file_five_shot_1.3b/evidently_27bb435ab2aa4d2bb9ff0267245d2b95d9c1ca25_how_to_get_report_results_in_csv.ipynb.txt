    The code you provided is a comprehensive example of how to use the `evidently` library to analyze the quality of a dataset. The example is focused on the classification column mapping, which is a crucial step in the data preprocessing pipeline.

    The example loads a dataset from the OpenML repository, applies a column mapping, and then runs several tests on the data to evaluate its quality. The results are stored in a pandas DataFrame, which is then saved to CSV files for further analysis.

    The tests include:

    - The number of columns in the data.
    - The type of columns in the data.
    - The number of empty rows in the data.
    - The number of empty columns in the data.
    - The number of duplicated rows in the data.
    - The number of duplicated columns in the data.

    The results of these tests are stored in a separate DataFrame, which is then saved to CSV files for further analysis.

    The final DataFrame, which combines the results of the column mapping and the tests, is saved to CSV files for further analysis.

    The example also includes a report for missing values, which is a crucial step in the data preprocessing pipeline. The results of this report are stored in a separate DataFrame, which is then saved to CSV files for further analysis.

    The final DataFrame, which combines the results of the column mapping, missing values, and the tests, is saved to CSV files for further analysis.

    The example also includes a test suite, which is a collection of tests that are run on the data. The results of these tests are stored in a separate DataFrame, which is then saved to CSV files for further analysis.

    The final DataFrame, which combines the results of the column mapping, missing values, the tests, and the test suite, is saved to CSV files for further analysis.
