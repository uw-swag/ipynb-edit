The code you provided is a modification of the `new_category_train_validation` function from the `mlchecks` library. The function is used to check the integrity of a dataset, specifically, it checks if the values in a categorical column are unique.

However, the function you provided is not actually using the `new_category_train_validation` function. The function you provided is just calling the function with the test and validation datasets.

If you want to modify the function without using it, you can do so by creating a new function that uses the `new_category_train_validation` function. Here is an example of how you can do this:

```python
def check_integrity(dataset):
    # Your code here
    pass

test_data = {"col1": ["somebody", "once", "told", "me"] * 10}
val_data = {"col1": ["the","world","is", "gonna", "role", "me"] * 10}
test = Dataset(pd.DataFrame(data=test_data), cat_features=["col1"])
val = Dataset(pd.DataFrame(data=val_data), cat_features=["col1"])

check_integrity(val)
check_integrity(test)
```

In this example, the `check_integrity` function is creating a new function that uses the `new_category_train_validation` function. The function is then used to check the integrity of the test and validation datasets.

Please replace the `pass` statement with your own code to check the integrity of the dataset.
