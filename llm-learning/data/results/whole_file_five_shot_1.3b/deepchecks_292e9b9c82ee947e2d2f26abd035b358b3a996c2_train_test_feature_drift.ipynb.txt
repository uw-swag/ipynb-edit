    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the Deepchecks library to perform a feature drift check on a dataset. The notebook starts by importing necessary libraries and loading a dataset. Then, it creates a pipeline to handle categorical features and a decision tree model. The pipeline is then fitted to the training data and used to generate a drift check. The result of the drift check is printed out.

    The code seems to be incomplete and there are some missing cells. The missing cells seem to be related to the creation of the DataFrame for the training and testing datasets, the fitting of the model, and the execution of the drift check.

    The code also seems to be missing some cells related to the execution of the drift check.
