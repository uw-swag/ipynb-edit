    The code you provided is a part of a machine learning pipeline. It's a common pattern in data science where you first load and preprocess your data, then train a model on it, and finally evaluate the model's performance.

    The bug in the code you provided is not clear from the provided cells. However, based on the code, it seems like the `C` parameter in the logistic regression model is not defined. This could be a mistake in the code or a typo.

    If `C` is the inverse of the class weight, then the code should work as expected. If it's not, you might need to adjust the code accordingly.
