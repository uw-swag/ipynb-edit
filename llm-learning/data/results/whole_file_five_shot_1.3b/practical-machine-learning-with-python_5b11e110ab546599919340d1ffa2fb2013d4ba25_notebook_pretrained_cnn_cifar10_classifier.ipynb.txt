    ## Chapter 12: Conclusion

    In this chapter, we have discussed the application of machine learning models to predict home appliances' cooling degree days (CDDs) based on various features such as temperature, humidity, and light levels. We have also looked at the impact of different features on the CDD prediction.

    The results of our model training and testing show that the model's performance is quite good, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately 0.14. This suggests that the model's predictions are generally accurate, but there are some areas where it may need further improvement.

    The model's predictions are also notably affected by the presence of missing values in the data. This is a significant issue, as it can lead to inaccurate predictions. We have also discussed how to handle missing values in the data, such as by imputing them with the mean or median of the respective column, or by using a more sophisticated method like the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

    In the next chapter, we will delve into the application of more advanced machine learning techniques, such as ensemble methods and deep learning. We will also discuss the impact of these techniques on the model's performance and the role of regularization in these methods.

    Finally, we will conclude by discussing the implications of our work and the potential future directions of our project.
