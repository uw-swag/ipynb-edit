```python
    # Importing necessary libraries
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns

    # Load the data
    df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

    # Perform initial EDA
    # This will include data types, missing values, statistical summary, etc.

    # Data Cleaning
    # This will include handling missing values, outliers, etc.

    # Data Visualization
    # This will include creating plots, histograms, bar graphs, etc.

    # Feature Engineering
    # This will include creating new features, encoding categorical variables, etc.

    # Model Building
    # This will include selecting and training models, evaluating models, etc.

    # Conclusion
    # This will include summarizing the findings from the EDA.

    # Documentation
    # This will include writing documentation for the code, explaining the purpose of each section.
    ```
    This is a general structure for restructuring the EDA repository. The specifics will depend on the specifics of the data and the goals of the analysis.
