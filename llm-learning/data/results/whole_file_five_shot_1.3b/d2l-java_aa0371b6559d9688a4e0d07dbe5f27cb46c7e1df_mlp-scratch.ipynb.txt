```
    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the Deep Java Library (DJL) to train a neural network for image classification. The notebook includes loading dependencies, defining the model architecture, training the model, and evaluating the model.

    The cell `%%loadFromPOM` is used to load dependencies from the Maven repository. The cell `<dependency>` is used to specify the dependencies of the notebook.

    The cell `%%load` is used to load Java files. The files are `DataPoints.java`, `Training.java`, and `plot-utils.ipynb`.

    The cell `<Cell_3>` is where the model architecture is defined. It imports necessary classes and defines the network architecture.

    The cell `<Cell_4>` is where the training loop is defined. It creates an iterator for the training dataset, and then trains the model.

    The cell `<Cell_5>` is where the model parameters are initialized.

    The cell `<Cell_6>` is where the ReLU function is defined.

    The cell `<Cell_7>` is where the model is defined.

    The cell `<Cell_8>` is where the loss function is defined.

    The cell `<Cell_9>` is where the training loop is defined. It runs the training loop for a number of epochs.

    The cell `<Cell_10>` is where the model is trained and evaluated.

    The cell `<Cell_11>` is where the results are plotted.

    The notebook is designed to be run in a Jupyter notebook environment.
