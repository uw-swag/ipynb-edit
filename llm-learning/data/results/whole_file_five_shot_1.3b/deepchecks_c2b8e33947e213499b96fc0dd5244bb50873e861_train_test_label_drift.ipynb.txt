    The code you provided is a demonstration of how to use the DeepChecks library to perform label drift checks. Here's a brief explanation of the changes:

    1. The code imports the necessary libraries and classes.
    2. It creates some random data for training and testing.
    3. It creates a DataFrame from these data and converts the 'target' column to a binary format.
    4. It creates a Dataset object for each dataframe.
    5. It runs a TrainTestLabelDrift check on the training and testing datasets.
    6. It modifies the test data to include a drift condition.
    7. It runs the check again to see if the drift condition is met.

    The DeepChecks library is a powerful tool for data quality checks and analysis. It provides a wide range of checks for different data types and quality issues.

    Please note that the code provided is a simple example and may not cover all possible scenarios. For a more comprehensive understanding, you should refer to the DeepChecks documentation and examples.

    Also, please note that the code is written in Python and uses the DeepChecks library, which is a Python-based machine learning library.
