    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook and it seems to be related to data analysis and machine learning. The code is removing the metrics dependence from analyzers and updating numpy files.

    The `metrics` dependency is used to calculate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc. in the `Dashboard` class. This is not necessary for the `numpy` files.

    The `numpy` files are used to store and manipulate numerical data. They are used to store the data and perform mathematical operations on it.

    The `numpy` files are not directly related to the `Dashboard` class or any other part of the code. They are used to perform mathematical operations on the data.

    If you want to remove the `metrics` dependency from the `Dashboard` class, you can simply remove the import statement for `metrics` from the code.

    If you want to update the `numpy` files, you can use the `numpy` functions to perform operations on the data. For example, you can use the `numpy.mean()` function to calculate the mean of a numerical column.

    However, please note that the `numpy` files are not directly related to the `Dashboard` class or any other part of the code. They are used to perform mathematical operations on the data.

    If you want to remove the `numpy` files, you can simply remove the import statement for `numpy` from the code.
