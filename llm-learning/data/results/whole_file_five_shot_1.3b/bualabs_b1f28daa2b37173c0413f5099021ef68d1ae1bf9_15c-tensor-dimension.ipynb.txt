```python
    import tensorflow as tf

    # Define a 15c tensor
    tensor_15c = tf.zeros((1, 15, 15, 15, 15))

    # Reshape the tensor
    tensor_reshaped = tf.reshape(tensor_15c, (15, 15, 15, 15, 15))

    # Print the original and reshaped tensor
    print("Original Tensor Shape: ", tensor_15c.shape)
    print("Reshaped Tensor Shape: ", tensor_reshaped.shape)
    ```

    The original tensor has a shape of (1, 15, 15, 15, 15) and after reshaping, it has a shape of (15, 15, 15, 15, 15).
