```python
    import deepchecks
    from deepchecks.checks import MixedNulls
    import pandas as pd

    # Create a DataFrame
    data = {'col1': ['sog', '1', 'cat', None, None],
            'col2': ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'],
            'col3': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)

    # Run the MixedNulls check
    mixed_nulls_check = MixedNulls()
    mixed_nulls_check.run(df)
    ```

    The `MixedNulls` check in Deepchecks is used to detect rows with mixed null values. It identifies rows where at least one of the columns has a null value.

    The `run` method of the `MixedNulls` check is used to perform the check on a DataFrame. The check returns a report of the results, which can be printed or saved to a file.

    The `deepchecks.checks.MixedNulls` class is a part of the Deepchecks library, which is used to perform checks on DataFrames.

    The `pd.DataFrame` function is used to create a DataFrame from a dictionary of lists, where the keys of the dictionary are the column names and the values are the lists of values for each column.

    The `MixedNulls().run(dataframe)` call is used to perform the check on the DataFrame `dataframe`. The result is a report of the check, which can be printed or saved to a file.
