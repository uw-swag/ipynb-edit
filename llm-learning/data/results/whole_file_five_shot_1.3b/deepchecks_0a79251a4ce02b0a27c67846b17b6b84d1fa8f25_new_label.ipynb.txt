    The commit message "fix check result (#182)" is a fix for the check result with the ID "#182". The check result is a DeepChecks check that checks for the presence of new labels in the training and validation sets.

    The original code cells are as follows:

    - Cell_0: The import statement for the DeepChecks check.
    - Cell_1: The creation of two datasets, one for the training set and one for the validation set.
    - Cell_2: The execution of the DeepChecks check on the training set.
    - Cell_3: The creation of another two datasets, this time with new labels.
    - Cell_4: The execution of the DeepChecks check on the validation set.

    The commit message "fix check result (#182)" suggests that the check is failing, which is likely due to the presence of new labels in the datasets.

    The check result is a DeepChecks check that checks for the presence of new labels in the training and validation sets. The check is failing because the validation set contains new labels.

    The fix for the check result is to ensure that the training and validation sets are as similar as possible, i.e., they contain the same labels.

    The fix is to either:
    - Ensure that the training and validation sets are the same, or
    - Ensure that the validation set does not contain new labels.

    The fix is to be implemented in the DeepChecks check that is being run.
