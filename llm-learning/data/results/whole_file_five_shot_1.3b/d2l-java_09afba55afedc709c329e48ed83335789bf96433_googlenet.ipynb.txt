    The code you provided is a complete Jupyter notebook that uses the Deep Learning library DJL (Deep Java Library) to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The notebook includes importing necessary libraries, defining the CNN architecture, training the model, and evaluating the model.

    The notebook also includes code to display the training loss, accuracy, and other metrics over epochs. The final part of the notebook uses the Table and LinePlot components from the DJL library to visualize the training process.

    The code is written in Java, and it uses the DJL library's functionalities to define the CNN architecture, train the model, and evaluate the model. The notebook also uses the Table and LinePlot components from the DJL library to visualize the training process.
