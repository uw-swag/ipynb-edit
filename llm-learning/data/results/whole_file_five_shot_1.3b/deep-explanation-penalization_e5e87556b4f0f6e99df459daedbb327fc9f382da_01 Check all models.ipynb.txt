    The code you provided is a part of a larger codebase, and it seems to be related to a machine learning model training process. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    1. The code imports necessary libraries and modules.
    2. It then loads the trained models from the 'trained_models' directory and loads the initial models from the 'init_models' directory.
    3. It reads the weights from the trained models and stores them in a pandas DataFrame.
    4. It checks if the weights of the initial models are equivalent to the weights of the trained models. If not, it breaks the loop.
    5. It prints "All good" if all weights are equivalent.
    6. It prints the keys of the DataFrame.
    7. It calculates the final accuracy and explanation divergence for each model and stores them in the DataFrame.
    8. It sorts the DataFrame by the explanation divergence.
    9. It plots the explanation divergence and test loss for each model.

    The code is annotated with comments to explain the purpose of each part of the code.
