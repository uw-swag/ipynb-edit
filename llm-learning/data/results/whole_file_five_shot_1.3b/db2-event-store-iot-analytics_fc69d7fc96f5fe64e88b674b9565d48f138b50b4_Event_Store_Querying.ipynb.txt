    The code you provided is a set of Jupyter notebook cells that are used to set the host IP address, port, database name, and table name for an Event Store connection. 

    The first cell sets the host IP address to "192.168.0.104". The second cell prints the endpoint for the Event Store connection. The third cell creates a SparkSession and an EventSession. The fourth cell opens the database. The fifth-seventh cells are used to retrieve the table names, create a temporary view, and run SQL queries. The last few cells are used to run more complex SQL queries.

    The code is not complete and there are some missing cells. For example, the cell that sets the host IP address is missing. The cell that retrieves the table names is also missing. The cell that creates a temporary view is also missing. The cell that runs a SQL query is also missing. The cell that runs a more complex SQL query is also missing.

    The code is incomplete because it does not provide a complete solution. It is missing the complete solution to the problem you are trying to solve.
