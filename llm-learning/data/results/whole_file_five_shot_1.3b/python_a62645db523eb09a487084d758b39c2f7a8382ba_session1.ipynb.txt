    ## Uploading files via the Colab UI
    ## To upload files, click on the "Upload" button in the toolbar on the left side of the notebook.
    ## You can then select the files you want to upload.
    ## Once you've uploaded the files, they will appear in the "Files" pane on the left side of the notebook.
    ## You can drag and drop the files into the notebook to rearrange them.
    ## You can also select the files to be uploaded from your local machine.
    ## The files will be uploaded to the root directory of the notebook.
    ## For example, if you've uploaded a file called "my_data.csv", it will be available as "my_data.csv" in the current directory.
    ## You can use the "os" library to list the files in the current directory.
    ## For example, the following code will list the files in the current directory:
    ###
    ## import os
    ## os.listdir(".")
    ##
    ## This will return a list of the files in the current directory, including the uploaded file.
    ## You can then use the "os" library to read the contents of the uploaded file.
    ## For example, the following code will read the contents of the uploaded file:
    ###
    ## import os
    ## with open(os.path.join(".", "my_data.csv"), "r") as f:
    ##     print(f.read())
    ##
    ## This will print the contents of the uploaded file.
    ## Please note that the uploaded files will be deleted when the notebook is closed.
    ## If you want to keep the uploaded files, you can save them to a different directory.
    ## For example, you can save the uploaded file to a directory called "data" like this:
    ###
    ## import os
    ## with open(os.path.join(".", "my_data.csv"), "r") as f:
    ##     with open(os.path.join(".", "data", "my_data.csv"), "w") as f_out:
