    The code you provided is a set of Maven dependencies and a set of Jupyter notebook cells. The Maven dependencies are used to download and import machine learning libraries such as Deep Learning API (ai.djl) and MXNet. The Jupyter notebook cells are used to perform various tasks such as loading dependencies, defining functions, training a neural network, and visualizing the results.

    The Maven dependencies are used to download and import machine learning libraries and tools. The Jupyter notebook cells are used to perform various tasks such as loading dependencies, defining functions, training a neural network, and visualizing the results.

    The code also includes a function `dropoutLayer` that implements the dropout mechanism, a function `net` that defines the neural network architecture, and a function `train` that trains the neural network. The code also includes a function `model_nn` that trains the neural network and evaluates its performance. The code also includes a function `render` that renders a plot of the results.

    The code is written in Java and uses the Deep Learning API (ai.djl) and MXNet. The code is also written in a Jupyter notebook format.
