    The Maven coordinates for the mxnet-native version are updated in the provided code. The version number is 0.7.0-SNAPSHOT.

    The mxnet-native library is used for the machine learning tasks in the AI.djl library. The library is built on top of the MXNet library, which is a deep learning framework.

    The code also includes the necessary import statements and the necessary functions for the training and optimization of the objective function.

    The `train2d` function is used to train the objective function with a custom trainer. The `showTrace2d` function is used to show the trace of the 2D variables during the optimization.

    The `newton` function is used to optimize the objective function with the Newton's method. The `showTrace` function is used to show the trace of the variables during the optimization.
