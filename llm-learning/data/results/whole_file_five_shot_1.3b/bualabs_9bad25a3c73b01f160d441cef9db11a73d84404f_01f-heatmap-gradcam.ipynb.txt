```python
    import torch

    # Assuming you have a model and a loss function
    model = ...
    loss_fn = ...

    # Assuming you have a gradient
    grad = ...

    # Compute the gradient with respect to the weights
    model.zero_grad()
    output = model(input)
    loss = loss_fn(output, target)
    loss.backward()

    # Compute the gradient with respect to the weights from the last layer
    # This is the gradient from backpropagation from different category
    last_layer_grad = model.layers[-1].grad

    # You can now use last_layer_grad to train your model
    ```
