The typo in the code is in the last cell where `suite_result.save_as_html()` is called. The function should be `suite_result.save_as_html(file=html_out)`. Here is the corrected code:

```python
<Cell_5>
suite_result.save_as_html(file=html_out)
<\Cell_5>
```

The corrected code will save the result to an HTML file named 'my_suite.html' in the current directory.
