    The code you've provided seems to be a mix of Python and Jupyter notebook code, and it seems to be related to the digit recognition task in the AudioMNIST dataset.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The code first imports necessary libraries and modules.
    - It then defines a function to generate a dataset.
    - The dataset is generated by drawing samples from a multivariate normal distribution.
    - The dataset is then mapped into a feature space using a transformation matrix.
    - The scree plot is a visualization of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.
    - The code then calculates the covariance matrix of the dataset and plots it.
    - The code then calculates the singular value decomposition of the dataset and plots the singular values.
    - The code then calculates the scree plot of the singular values and plots it.
    - The code then calculates the scree plot of the squared singular values and plots it.
    - The code then calculates the scree plot of the absolute values of the singular values and plots it.
    - The code then calculates the scree plot of the absolute values of the squared singular values and plots it.
    - The code then calculates the scree plot of the absolute values of the absolute values of the singular values and plots it.
    - The code then calculates the scree plot of the absolute values of the absolute values of the squared singular values and plots it.
    - The code then calculates the scree plot of the absolute values of the absolute values of the absolute values of the singular values and plots it.
    - The code then calculates the scree plot of the absolute values of the absolute values of the absolute values of the squared singular values and plots it.
    - The code then calculates the scree plot of the absolute values of the absolute values of the absolute values of the absolute values of the singular values and plots it.

    Please note that the code is a mix of Python and Jupyter notebook code, and it seems to be related to the digit recognition task in the AudioMNIST dataset.
