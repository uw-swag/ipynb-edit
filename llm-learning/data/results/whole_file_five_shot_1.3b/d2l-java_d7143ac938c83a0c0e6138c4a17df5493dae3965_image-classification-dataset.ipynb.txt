    The commit message "Replace 10.0 snapshot with release (#91)" is a change in the version of the project. The project is currently using a snapshot version of 10.0, which is a development version. The commit message suggests that the project is now using a release version of 10.0, which is a stable version.

    The original code cells are loading Maven dependencies and importing necessary classes from the `ai.djl` package. The `ai.djl` package is a machine learning library in Java, and it includes various machine learning models and datasets.

    The `getDataset` method is used to load a dataset from the `ai.djl` package. The `FashionMnist` class is used to load the Fashion-MNIST dataset, which is a dataset of Zalando's article images consisting of 60,000 examples of clothing articles.

    The `showImages` method is used to display a list of images. It takes a dataset, the number of images to display, the width and height of the images, the scale, and a `NDManager` object as parameters. It creates a JFrame and adds a JPanel for each image to the JFrame.

    The `Container` class is used to create a JPanel with a label. The `ImagePanel` class is used to create a JPanel with an image.

    The `getFashionMnistLabel` and `getFashionMnistLabels` methods are used to get the label of an image and a list of labels.

    The `showImages` method is used to display a list of images. It creates a JFrame and adds a JPanel for each image to the JFrame.

    The `continue` statement is commented out, as it seems to be a placeholder for a loop that continues to the next batch of data.

    The `stopWatch.stop()` method is used to stop the stopwatch and print the elapsed time.

    The last part of the code is empty, as it seems to be a placeholder for the rest of the code.
