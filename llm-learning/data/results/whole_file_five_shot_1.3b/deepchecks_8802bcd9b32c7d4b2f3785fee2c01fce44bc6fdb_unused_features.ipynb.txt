# Deleting notebooks
<\Cell_7>

The code you provided is deleting Jupyter notebooks. Jupyter notebooks are a web-based interactive computational environment that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. They are widely used in data science and machine learning.

However, the code you provided is not deleting any notebooks. It's just deleting the notebooks from your local system. If you want to delete the notebooks, you can use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
jupyter notebook delete <path_to_notebook>
```

Replace `<path_to_notebook>` with the path to the notebook you want to delete. For example, if your notebook is in the "my_notebook" directory, you would use:

```bash
jupyter notebook delete my_notebook
```

This command will delete the notebook from your local Jupyter server.
