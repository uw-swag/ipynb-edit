    # Create Decision Tree classifer object
    clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()

    # Train Decision Tree Classifer
    clf = clf.fit(X_train,y_train)

    ### Response:
    # Now, we can use this trained model to make predictions on the test set.
    y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

    ### Response:
    # We can also evaluate the performance of the model by checking the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
    print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
    print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))

    ### Response:
    # Finally, we can visualize the decision tree to understand the model's decision process.
    from sklearn.tree import plot_tree
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.figure(figsize=(15,10))

    ### Response:
    # The decision tree visualization will help us to understand the decision process of the model.
    # We can also use the feature importance to understand the importance of each feature in the decision process.
    feature_importances = pd.DataFrame(clf.feature_importances_,
