    The code cells you provided are related to a feature classification task, which involves various parameters such as the type of experiment, performance indicators, and channels to be used. The changes in these parameters are related to the configuration settings in a configuration file (config.ini) and the parameters of a machine learning model.

    Here's a brief explanation of the changes:

    1. The experiments parameter is now a list of strings, which could be 'Average', 'LeftRight', or 'Full'.
    2. The performance indicators are now a list of strings, which could be 'Accuracy', 'Sensitivity', 'Specificity', 'Precision', 'F1 Score', 'MCC', 'Kappa', or 'Time'.
    3. The channels parameter is now a list of strings, which could represent different electroencephalogram (EEG) channels.
    4. The configuration settings are now read from a configuration file, which could include parameters like the type of data to be read (readEdf), the dataset to be used, the file to import data from, the file to export data to, the sample rate, the time window, the step size for the classification, the test ratio, the tolerance for PCA, the undersampling method, the undersampling rate, the number of undersampling neighbors, the oversampling method, the number of oversampling neighbors, the number of folds in the k-fold cross-validation, the number of epochs in the training, the dropout percentage, the loss function, and the metric.
    5. The code now reads the data from a file, or it could read the data from a pandas DataFrame if readEdf is False.
    6. The code now runs the experiment for each of the experiments, storing the results in a separate file for each experiment.

    Please note that the code is a part of a larger system and the changes are likely to be part of a more complex system.
