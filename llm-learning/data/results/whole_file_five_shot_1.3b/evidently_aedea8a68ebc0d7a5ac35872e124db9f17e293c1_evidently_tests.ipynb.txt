    The code you've provided is a set of Jupyter notebooks that use the evidently library to test the quality of data. The notebooks are designed to remove future warnings and to test the quality of data. The tests include data integrity, data quality, data drift, and feature level. The notebooks also include options for customizing the color scheme of the visualizations.

    However, the code you've provided is not complete and does not include the execution of the notebooks. You would need to run the notebooks to see the results.
