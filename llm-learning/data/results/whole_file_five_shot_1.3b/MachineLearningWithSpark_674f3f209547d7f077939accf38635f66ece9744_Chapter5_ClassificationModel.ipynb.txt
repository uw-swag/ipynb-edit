    ### 1. Introduction to Neural Networks

    #### Definition
    Neural networks are a subset of machine learning algorithms that are inspired by the human brain. They are composed of interconnected nodes or "neurons", which process information in a way that resembles the way we process information in the human brain.

    #### Importance
    Neural networks play a crucial role in machine learning because they can model complex patterns, learn from data, and make predictions. They are used in a wide range of applications, from image and speech recognition to natural language processing and more.

    ### 2. Understanding Neural Networks

    #### Architecture
    Neural networks have a hierarchical structure, with the input layer, hidden layers, and output layer. The number of hidden layers and the type of layers (i.e., convolutional, recurrent, etc.) can significantly affect the performance of the network.

    #### Activation Functions
    Activation functions are used to introduce non-linearity into the network. They are applied to the output of each neuron in a layer. The most common activation functions are ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), sigmoid, and tanh.

    #### Parameters
    Neural networks have a number
