```python
    from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

    # Perform the chi-square test
    chi2, p, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(data)

    # Print the results
    print("Chi-square statistic: ", chi2)
    print("Degrees of freedom: ", dof)
    print("P-value: ", p)
    print("Expected frequencies: ", expected)

    # If p-value is less than the significance level (0.05), we reject the null hypothesis
    if p < 0.05:
        print("We reject the null hypothesis")
    else:
        print("We do not reject the null hypothesis")
