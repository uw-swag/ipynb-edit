```
    The code you provided is a pipeline definition for a machine learning pipeline using Kubeflow Pipelines. The pipeline includes three steps:

    1. `create_dataset`: This step reads data from a BigQuery table and writes it to a local directory.
    2. `train_model`: This step trains a decision tree classifier on the data from the local directory and writes the trained model to a local directory.
    3. `deploy_model`: This step deploys the trained model to a Vertex AI endpoint and writes the endpoint and model to a local directory.

    The pipeline parameters are defined in the `pipeline_params` dictionary at the bottom of the code.

    The pipeline is scheduled to run every 12 hours using the `AutoMLOps.go` function.

    Please note that the actual execution of the pipeline will depend on the environment where it is run.
