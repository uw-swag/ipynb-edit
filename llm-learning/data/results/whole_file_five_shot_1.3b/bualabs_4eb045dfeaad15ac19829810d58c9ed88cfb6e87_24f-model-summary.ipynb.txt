The code you've provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook that uses the FastAI library to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. The code imports necessary libraries and modules.
2. It defines a function `get_cnn_model` to create a CNN model.
3. It defines a class `GeneralRelu` that implements the Leaky ReLU activation function.
4. It defines a function `init_cnn` to initialize the weights of a model.
5. It creates a `Learner` object using the `databunch` and `model`.
6. It defines a function `model_summary` to print the shape of the output of each layer in the model.
7. The code then trains the model on the MNIST dataset and prints the accuracy of the model.

The code is divided into several cells for better readability and understanding. Each cell contains a specific task or operation related to the code.
