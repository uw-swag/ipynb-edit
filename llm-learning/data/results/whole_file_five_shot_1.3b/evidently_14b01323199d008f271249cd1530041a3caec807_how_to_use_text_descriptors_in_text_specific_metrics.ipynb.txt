    The provided code is a demonstration of how to use the EmbeddingsDriftDetection, json customization, and text descriptors in the evidently library. 

    The first part of the code imports necessary libraries and loads a dataset. The next part of the code defines a ColumnMapping object, which is used to map the columns in the dataset to the ones used in the report.

    The next part of the code defines a TextOverviewPreset object, which is used to generate a report with text descriptors. The report is then run on the reference and current data.

    The next part of the code defines a TextDescriptorsDriftMetric object, which is used to generate a report with drift metrics. The report is then run on the reference and current data.

    The next part of the code defines a ColumnDriftMetric object, which is used to generate a report with drift metrics for a specific column. The report is then run on the reference and current data.

    The last part of the code defines a DriftReport object, which is used to generate a report with drift metrics for all columns. The report is then run on the reference and current data.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the EmbeddingsDriftDetection object, which is used to detect drift in the review text.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the json customization feature in the evidently library, which allows you to customize the report and metrics.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the text descriptors feature in the evidently library, which allows you to generate descriptors for each column in the report.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the drift detection feature in the evidently library, which allows you to detect drift in the data.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the text overview feature in the evidently library, which allows you to generate a summary of the text in the review text.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the json customization feature in the evidently library, which allows you to customize the report and metrics.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the text descriptors feature in the evidently library, which allows you to generate descriptors for each column in the report.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the drift detection feature in the evidently library, which allows you to detect drift in the data.
