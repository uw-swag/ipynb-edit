    The commit message "removing useless git LFS" is removing the Large File Storage (LFS) from the code. Git LFS is a tool that helps Git to handle large files more efficiently. However, in this case, it's not necessary as the dataset used in the code is not too large.

    If you want to include the LFS, you can use the following command:

    ```
    git lfs install
    ```

    Then, you can add the files to the repository with:

    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Adding LFS"
    ```

    After that, you can commit the changes.
