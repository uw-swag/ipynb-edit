```
    from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
    def predict():
        data = request.get_json()
        # Here you can add your model prediction code
        # ...
        return jsonify(prediction)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=9696)
    ```
    This code creates a Flask server that listens for POST requests at the /predict endpoint. The data from the request is expected to be a JSON object, which is then used to make a prediction. The prediction is then returned as a JSON response.
