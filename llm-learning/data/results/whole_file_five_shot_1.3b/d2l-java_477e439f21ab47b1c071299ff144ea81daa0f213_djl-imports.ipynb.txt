    The code you provided is for upgrading the DJL library to version 0.13.0. Here's a brief explanation of the changes:

    1. The `%maven` commands are used to add dependencies to your Maven project. These commands are used to specify the versions of the dependencies.

    2. The `import` statements are used to import the necessary classes from the DJL library.

    3. The `String datasetLimit = System.getenv("DATASET_LIMIT");` and `String maxEpoch = System.getenv("MAX_EPOCH");` lines are used to get environment variables. These are used to set properties that can be used by the DJL library.

    4. The `System.setProperty` calls are used to set properties that can be used by the DJL library. These properties are used to control certain aspects of the DJL library, such as the logging level.

    5. The `if (datasetLimit != null) { System.setProperty("DATASET_LIMIT", datasetLimit); }` and `if (maxEpoch != null) { System.setProperty("MAX_EPOCH", maxEpoch); }` lines are used to set environment variables. These are used to control certain aspects of the DJL library, such as the number of dataset iterations.

    6. The `System.setProperty` calls are used to set properties that can be used by the DJL library. These properties are used to control certain aspects of the DJL library, such as the logging level.

    7. The `import` statements are used to import the necessary classes from the DJL library.

    8. The `String` variables are used to set properties that can be used by the DJL library. These are used to control certain aspects of the DJL library, such as the logging level.

    9. The `if (datasetLimit != null) { System.setProperty("DATASET_LIMIT", datasetLimit); }` and `if (maxEpoch != null) { System.setProperty("MAX_EPOCH", maxEpoch); }` lines are used to set environment variables. These are used to control certain aspects of the DJL library, such as the number of dataset iterations.
