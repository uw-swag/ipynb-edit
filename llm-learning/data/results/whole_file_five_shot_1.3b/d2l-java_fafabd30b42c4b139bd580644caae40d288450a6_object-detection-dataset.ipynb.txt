    # Object Detection Section 13.6 (#26)
    # Object detection is a crucial part of image processing and computer vision.
    # In this section, we will discuss the concept of object detection, its applications, and the steps involved in its development.

    # 1. Concept of Object Detection
    # Object detection is the process of identifying and locating objects in an image or video frame.
    # It involves the following steps:

    # 1.1 Feature Extraction: This is the process of extracting features from the image that can be used to identify objects.
    # This can be done using techniques like Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB), or more recently, the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

    # 1.2 Object Classification: After extracting the features, the next step is to classify the objects. This is done by training a classifier on a labeled dataset.

    # 1.3 Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS): This is a post-processing step that removes overlapping bounding boxes, thus reducing the number of detected objects.

    # 1.4 Final Object Detection: The final step is to combine all the detected objects into a final output.

    # 2. Applications of Object Detection
    # Object detection is widely used in various applications such as surveillance, autonomous driving, and self-driving cars.
    # It can also be used in applications like facial recognition, where it can identify individuals in images.

    # 3. Development of Object Detection
    # Object detection is a complex task that involves a combination of computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning.
    # The development of object detection algorithms can be challenging due to the need for a large and diverse dataset.
    # However, there are several open-source and commercial libraries and tools that can be used to develop object detection systems.

    # 4. Challenges in Object Detection
    # While object detection is a powerful tool, it is not without its challenges.
    # One of the main challenges is the difficulty in accurately identifying and locating objects in images.
    # Another challenge is the need for a large and diverse dataset
