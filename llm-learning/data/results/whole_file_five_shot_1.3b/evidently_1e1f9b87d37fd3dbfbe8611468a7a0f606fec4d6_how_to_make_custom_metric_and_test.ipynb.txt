    The code you provided is a collection of Jupyter notebook cells. Each cell is a part of the code that is executed in the order it is presented.

    Here's a brief explanation of what each cell does:

    1. `<Cell_0>`: This cell imports the necessary libraries for the code to run.

    2. `<Cell_1>`: This cell defines a custom metric result class.

    3. `<Cell_2>`: This cell defines a custom metric class.

    4. `<Cell_3>`: This cell defines a custom metric renderer class.

    5. `<Cell_4>`: This cell imports the necessary libraries and sets up the runtime environment.

    6. `<Cell_5>`: This cell defines a custom metric result class.

    7. `<Cell_6>`: This cell defines a custom metric class.

    8. `<Cell_7>`: This cell defines a custom metric renderer class.

    9. `<Cell_8>`: This cell imports the necessary libraries and sets up the runtime environment.

    10. `<Cell_9>`: This cell defines a custom test class.

    11. `<Cell_10>`: This cell defines a custom test renderer class.

    12. `<Cell_11>`: This cell imports the necessary libraries and sets up the runtime environment.

    13. `<Cell_12>`: This cell defines a custom test suite class.

    Each cell is executed in the order they are presented.
