    ## Code explanation
    The code is a Python script that reads EEG data from a specified dataset, extracts time-domain features, and applies dimensionality reduction using PCA. The features are then normalized and returned. The metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient, and Cohen's Kappa are also calculated and returned.

    ## Dependencies
    The script requires the following Python libraries:
    - pandas for data manipulation
    - numpy for numerical operations
    - scipy for signal processing
    - sklearn for machine learning
    - pyedflib for reading EEG data
    - pyentrp for entropy calculation
    - tqdm for progress bar
    - matplotlib for data visualization

    ## Usage
    The script can be run from a Python environment. The EEG data should be stored in a directory structure that matches the one specified in the 'dataset' variable. The script will read the data, extract the features, normalize them, apply PCA for dimensionality reduction, and calculate the metrics.

    ## Note
    The code assumes that the EEG data is in the form of .edf files. The code also assumes that the seizure data is in the form of .seizures files. The code also assumes that the seizure data is located in the same directory as the EEG data.
