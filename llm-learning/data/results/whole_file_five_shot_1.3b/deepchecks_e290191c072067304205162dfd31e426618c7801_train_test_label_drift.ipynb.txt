The code you provided is a script for updating the examples in a Jupyter notebook. The script imports necessary libraries, creates a random dataset, and then runs a check for label drift using the `TrainTestLabelDrift` check. The check is then run on the training and test datasets.

The script also includes a condition for the check to pass, which is a check that ensures the drift score is not greater than a certain value. In this case, the drift score is the absolute value of a random number plus an incremented value, which is multiplied by 0.001.
