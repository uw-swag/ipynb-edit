    The check `DatasetInfo` is used to check the information of the dataset. The function `dataset_info` is a function that takes a `Dataset` object as input and returns a string that describes the dataset. The string is then printed to the console.

    The `Dataset` object is created by passing the dataframe `df` to the `Dataset` constructor. The `DatasetInfo` check is then applied to this `Dataset` object, printing the result to the console.

    Please note that the `mlchecks` library is not installed in your environment. You can install it using pip:
    ```
    pip install mlchecks
    ```
    Also, please note that the `mlchecks` library is a part of the `mlchecks` package, not a standalone library. You need to install the `mlchecks` package separately.
