    ## Chapter 11: Conclusion

    In this chapter, we have explored the data and analyzed the relationship between the price of pumpkins and the month. We have seen that pumpkins are generally cheaper in the winter months compared to the summer months. This trend can be further observed in the bar graph, which shows the average price of pumpkins for each month.

    The conclusion of this chapter is that pumpkins are generally cheaper in the winter months compared to the summer months. This trend can be further studied to gain insights into the demand for pumpkins.
