The code you provided is a part of a larger codebase, and it seems to be a part of a data analysis project. Here's a brief explanation of what the code does:

1. It imports necessary libraries and modules.
2. It sets up a warning filter to ignore warnings.
3. It defines some parameters for the plotting and data processing.
4. It fetches raw data for a specific stock index.
5. It plots the closing prices of the stock.
6. It prepares the data for training and testing the LSTM model.
7. It trains the LSTM model and prints the training and test scores.
8. It uses the trained model to predict future prices and plots the results.

The code is not doing anything that could be considered "useless" or "unnecessary" in the context of this project. It's a part of a larger data analysis project, and it's doing a lot of useful work.

However, if you're looking to remove the unnecessary parts of the code, you could consider removing the following parts:

- The parts related to data fetching and plotting.
- The parts related to model training and evaluation.
- The parts related to early stopping.
- The parts related to the LSTM model.

These parts are not doing anything that could be considered "useless" or "unnecessary" in the context of this project. They're just there for the sake of completeness.
