    The typo in the "extra_autodiff" module is in the "d2f" function. The function should be "d2f" not "extra_autodiff".

    The corrected code is as follows:

    ```python
    def d2f(x, y):
        return [gradients(dfdx, [x, y]), gradients(dfdy, [x, y])]
    ```

    The "extra_autodiff" module is not a part of the original code. It seems like a typo or a misspelling.
