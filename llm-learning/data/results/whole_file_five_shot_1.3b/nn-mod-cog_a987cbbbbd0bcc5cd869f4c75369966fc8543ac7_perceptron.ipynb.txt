    ## Perceptron

    A Perceptron is a type of artificial neural network that is a linear classifier. It is a binary classifier, meaning it can only classify data points into two categories.

    The perceptron model is a simple model that uses a single layer of weights and a single bias term. The weights and bias term are learned during the training process.

    The perceptron model is a linear classifier, meaning it can only classify data points into two categories. The model is trained using the Perceptron algorithm, which is a simple yet effective algorithm for binary classification tasks.
