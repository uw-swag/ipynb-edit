    The code is refactoring the `get_data` function to batch the data. The original function was loading the entire dataset at once, which is not efficient for large datasets. The refactored function now batches the data in batches of size `bs`, which is a common practice in machine learning.

    The refactored function also normalizes the data, which is a common practice in machine learning.

    The function also calculates the number of features (`n`), the number of classes (`c`), and the number of hidden units (`nh`) in the model.

    The function also defines the model architecture, which is a common practice in machine learning.

    The function also defines the loss function and the accuracy function.

    The function also defines the learning rate (`lr`), the number of epochs (`epoch`), and the number of hidden units (`nh`) in the model.

    The function also defines the batch size (`bs`), and the number of hidden units (`nh`) in the model.

    The function also defines the model, the predictions, the loss, the accuracy, and the training loop.

    The function also defines the x and y batches, and the x and y batches for validation.

    The function also defines the x and y batches for testing.
