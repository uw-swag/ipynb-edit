    The commit message "bump of D2L Java book version to 0.8.0 (#58)" indicates a change in the version of the D2L Java book from 0.7.0 to 0.8.0. This is a significant change from the previous version, as it includes the addition of new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

    The code cells in the commit message are related to the development of a machine learning model using the Deep Java Library (D2L). The model is a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with a fixed hidden layer. The model is trained using the MNIST dataset, and the final prediction is displayed.

    The code also includes the creation of a new class, `FixedHiddenMLP`, which is a subclass of `AbstractBlock`. This class implements a multi-layer perceptron with a fixed hidden layer, similar to the `MLP` class, but with a different initialization method.

    The code also includes the creation of a new class, `NestMLP`, which is a subclass of `AbstractBlock`. This class implements a multi-layer perceptron with a nested structure, similar to the `MLP` class, but with a different initialization method.

    The code also includes the creation of a new class, `MySequential`, which is a subclass of `AbstractBlock`. This class implements a sequential block, similar to the `MLP` class, but with a different initialization method.
