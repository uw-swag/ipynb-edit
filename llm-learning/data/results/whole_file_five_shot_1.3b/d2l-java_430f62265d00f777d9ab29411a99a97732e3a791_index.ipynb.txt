    This script clones all repositories in the specified GitHub organization and adds the DeepJavaLibrary repository as a remote. It then pushes the changes to the DeepJavaLibrary repository. Please replace "your-github-org" with the actual GitHub organization name.

    Note: This script assumes that you have the necessary permissions to clone and push repositories to the DeepJavaLibrary repository. Also, it assumes that the DeepJavaLibrary repository is the default branch. If your setup is different, you may need to adjust the script accordingly.
