    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the DeepChecks library to perform various data quality checks and visualizations on a dataset. The DeepChecks library is a Python library that provides a unified interface to perform data quality checks, model evaluation, and visualization.

    The code includes several cells:

    1. The first cell imports necessary libraries and loads a synthetic dataset.

    2. The second cell displays the first few rows of the dataset.

    3. The third cell prints the first few rows of the dataset.

    4. The fourth cell calculates the number of rows in the dataset.

    5. The fifth cell creates a pipeline for preprocessing the dataset.

    6. The sixth cell fits the pipeline to the training data and transforms the training and test data.

    7. The seventh cell fits a logistic regression model to the training data and makes predictions on the test data.

    8. The eighth cell calculates the accuracy of the model.

    9. The ninth cell runs a suite of tests on the model.

    10. The tenth cell filters the dataset to include only rows where the 'scrape_date' does not contain '2020'.

    11. The eleventh cell fits a decision tree model to the training data and makes predictions on the test data.

    12. The twelfth cell fits a gradient boosting model to the training data and makes predictions on the test data.

    The code is structured in a way that allows for easy navigation and understanding of the data processing and analysis process.

    The DeepChecks library is a powerful tool for data quality checks and visualization, and it can be used to perform a wide range of data quality checks, model evaluation, and visualization tasks.
