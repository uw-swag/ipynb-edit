    # Fixing the anchor link to DataBunch.
    # The DataBunch class is used to create batches of data for training and validation.
    # The anchor link is used to specify the data source.
    # In the current implementation, the DataBunch class does not have a method to set the anchor link.
    # You can add a method to set the anchor link in the DataBunch class.
    # For example, you can add a method like this:
    # def set_anchor(self, anchor):
    #     self.anchor = anchor
    # Then, you can call this method when you create a DataBunch object.
    # For example, you can create a DataBunch object like this:
    # databunch = DataBunch(train_dl, valid_dl, c)
    # Then, you can set the anchor link like this:
    # databunch.set_anchor(anchor)
    ```
