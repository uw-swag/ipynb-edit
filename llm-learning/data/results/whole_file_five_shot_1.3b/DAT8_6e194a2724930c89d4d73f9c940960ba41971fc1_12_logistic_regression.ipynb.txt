    The code you've provided is updating a class of Jupyter notebooks and adding related scripts. Here's a brief explanation of what each section of code does:

    1. Importing necessary libraries and loading the glass identification dataset.
    2. Plotting a scatter plot of 'al' (aluminum) vs 'ri' (refractive index).
    3. Creating a scatter plot of 'al' vs 'ri' using matplotlib.
    4. Fitting a linear regression model to predict 'ri' based on 'al'.
    5. Making predictions for all values of 'al' and plotting the results.
    6. Plotting the original scatter plot with the regression line.
    7. Computing the prediction for 'al'=2 using the equation.
    8. Computing the prediction for 'al'=2 using the predict method.
    9. Examining the coefficient for 'al'.
    10. Increasing 'al' by 1 (so that 'al'=3) decreases 'ri' by 0.0025.
    11. Computing the prediction for 'al'=3 using the predict method.
    12. Examining the count of 'glass_type' to understand the distribution of glass types.
    13. Creating a new column 'household' that categorizes the glass types as 'household' (1) or 'not household' (0).
    14. Plotting a scatter plot of 'al' vs 'household' using the logistic regression model.
    15. Computing the log-odds for 'al'=2 using the equation.
    16. Converting the log-odds to odds.
    17. Converting the odds to probability.
    18. Computing the predicted probability for 'al'=2 using the predict_proba method.
    19. Examining the coefficient for 'al' using the predict_proba method.
    20. Examining the intercept of the logistic regression model.
    21. Converting the log-odds to probability using the predict_proba method.
    22. Creating a categorical feature 'high_ba' that categorizes 'ba
