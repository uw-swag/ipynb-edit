    The code provided is an example of a custom DeepChecks check, which is a tool for validating the size of the training and testing datasets. The check compares the sizes of the training and testing datasets and returns the sizes.

    The check is also included in a function that creates a matplotlib graph to visualize the comparison.

    The check is then run on a dummy dataset, which is used for demonstration purposes.

    The check returns a CheckResult object, which contains the check results and a display function. The display function is a function that creates a bar graph to visualize the comparison.

    The check is then run on the dummy dataset, which is used for demonstration purposes.
