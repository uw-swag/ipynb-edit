        This function calculates the loss for a regression problem.

    ```
    This code defines two loss functions for binary classification and regression problems. The first function calculates the cross-entropy loss, which is a common choice for binary classification problems. The second function calculates the mean squared error loss, which is a common choice for regression problems.
