    ## Batch Echoing
    # Batch echoing is a technique used in deep learning to increase the speed and efficiency of training. It involves echoing the input and output of a batch of data back to the input.

    ## Weight Decay and Dropout
    # Weight decay is a technique used in deep learning to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function based on the magnitude of the weights. Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training time, which helps prevent overfitting.
