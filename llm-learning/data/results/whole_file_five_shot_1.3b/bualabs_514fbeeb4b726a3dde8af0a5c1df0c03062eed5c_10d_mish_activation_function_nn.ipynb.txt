    ## Mish Activation Function
    The Mish (Mishartoosh) activation function is a smooth, non-saturating activation function that is more computationally efficient than the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) and sigmoid functions.

    The formula for the Mish function is:

    mish(x) = x * sigmoid(x)

    where sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x)) is the standard sigmoid function.

    The derivative of the Mish function is:

    dmish(x) = 1 - mish(x) * mish(x)

    This function is used in the Mish activation function in the deep learning models.
