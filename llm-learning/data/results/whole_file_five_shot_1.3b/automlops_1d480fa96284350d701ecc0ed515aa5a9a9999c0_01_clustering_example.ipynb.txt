The commit message "updated python version" was updated to reflect the Python 3.8 version. The original code was using Python 2.7, and the updated code is using Python 3.8.

The code also includes a new cell that sets the Python version to 3.8. This is done by using the `!python3.8` command in the cell.

The cell at the end of the code is a new cell that sets the Python version to 3.8 and then runs the AutoMLOps pipeline. The pipeline parameters are defined as a dictionary, and the pipeline is run with the `AutoMLOps.go` function. The `run_local` parameter is set to `False` to run the pipeline on the Google Cloud AI Platform. The `schedule_pattern` parameter is set to `'0 */12 * * *'`, which means the pipeline will be retrained every 12 hours.

The `AutoMLOps.generate` function is used to generate a new version of the pipeline with the updated Python version. This is done by setting the `python_version` parameter to `'3.8'`.

The `AutoMLOps.go` function is used to run the pipeline with the updated Python version. This is done by setting the `python_version` parameter to `'3.8'`.

The `project_id` parameter in the `AutoMLOps.go` function is set to the project ID of the Google Cloud project.

The `pipeline_params` dictionary is used to define the parameters for the pipeline. The `data_path` parameter is set to a Google Cloud Storage path, and the `cluster_path` parameter is set to another Google Cloud Storage path.

The `schedule_pattern` parameter in the `AutoMLOps.go` function is set to `'0 */12 * * *'`, which means the pipeline will be retrained every 12 hours.

The `run_local` parameter in the `AutoMLOps.go` function is set to `False`, which means the pipeline will be run on the Google Cloud AI Platform.

The `python_version` parameter in the `AutoMLOps.generate` function is set to `'3.8'`, which means a new version of the pipeline
