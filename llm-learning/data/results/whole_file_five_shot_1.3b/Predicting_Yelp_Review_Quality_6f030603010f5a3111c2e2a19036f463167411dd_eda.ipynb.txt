    The code you've provided is a set of Jupyter notebook cells that are used to create graphs and visualizations for a presentation. The cells are divided into different sections, each of which is responsible for a specific task.

    Here's a brief explanation of the cells:

    1. `<Cell_0>`: This cell imports necessary libraries and functions.

    2. `<Cell_1>`: This cell sets the style of the plots and the options for the pandas dataframe.

    3. `<Cell_2>`: This cell loads a dataframe from a SQL database.

    4. `<Cell_3>`: This cell drops duplicates from the dataframe and selects the first 10000 rows.

    5. `<Cell_4>`: This cell drops all non-numeric columns from the dataframe.

    6. `<Cell_5>`: This cell calculates the dataset release date.

    7. `<Cell_6>`: This cell splits the 'business_categories' column into multiple columns.

    8. `<Cell_7>`: This cell separates the dataframe into useful and non-useful reviews.

    9. `<Cell_8>`: This cell calculates the correlation matrix of the numeric columns.

    10. `<Cell_9>`: This cell plots the distribution of 'user_review_count_TD' in the dataframe.

    11. `<Cell_10>`: This cell creates a heatmap of the correlation matrix.

    12. `<Cell_11>`: This cell creates a bar chart of the distribution of 'T1_REG_review_total_ufc' in the dataframe.

    13. `<Cell_12>`: This cell creates a pie chart of the distribution of 'T2_CLS_ufc_>0' in the dataframe.

    14. `<Cell_13>`: This cell creates a bar chart of the distribution of 'T3_CLS_ufc_level' in the dataframe.

    15. `<Cell_14>`: This cell creates a bar chart of the distribution of 'T5_CLS
