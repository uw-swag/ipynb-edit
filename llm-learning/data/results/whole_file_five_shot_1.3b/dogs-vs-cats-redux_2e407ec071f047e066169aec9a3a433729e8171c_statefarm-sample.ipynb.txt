    The code you provided seems to be a mix of Python and Jupyter notebook code, and it's not clear what the purpose of the code is. It seems to be a part of a larger project or a script, and it's not clear what the purpose of the code is. 

    Here are some potential issues with your code:

    1. The code is not indented properly, which can make it difficult to understand.
    2. The code is not formatted properly, which can make it difficult to read.
    3. The code is not commented, which can make it difficult to understand.
    4. The code is not well-structured, which can make it difficult to maintain.
    5. The code is not well-organized, which can make it difficult to navigate.
    6. The code is not well-documented, which can make it difficult to understand.

    If you could provide more context or clarify what the purpose of the code is, I would be able to provide a more accurate response.
