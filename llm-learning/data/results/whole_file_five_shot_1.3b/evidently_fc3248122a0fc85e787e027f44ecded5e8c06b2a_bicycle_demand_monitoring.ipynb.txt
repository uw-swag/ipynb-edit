    The code you provided is a Python script that uses the sklearn library to train a RandomForestRegressor model on a bike sharing dataset. The script also uses the evidently library to generate several reports about the model's performance, target drift, data drift, and data quality.

    The script first imports necessary libraries and loads the bike sharing dataset. It then calculates the number of days in the dataset and converts it to weeks.

    The script then defines the target variable and the features to be used for prediction. It also sets up the directory for storing the reports.

    The script then loads the reference and current datasets, fits the model to the reference data, and makes predictions on the current data.

    The script then uses the ColumnMapping object to map the target and prediction variables, and uses the Report object to generate several performance reports.

    Finally, the script saves the performance reports to the specified directory.

    Please note that the code provided is a simplified version of the original code and may not work as expected if the original code is not available or has been modified.
