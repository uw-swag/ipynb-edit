    # np.random provides different options to create random data
    # create a 4x4 matrix with random, normally distributed values
    # you might want to set a random seed first to get reproducible results:
    # --> execute the cell a few times to see you always get a different matrix
    # --> then uncomment the line below and excecute it again a few times
    # np.random.seed(13)
