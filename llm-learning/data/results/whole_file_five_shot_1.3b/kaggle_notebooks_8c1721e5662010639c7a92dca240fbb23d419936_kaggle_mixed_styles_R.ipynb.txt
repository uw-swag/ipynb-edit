    The code you provided is a set of instructions for a Jupyter notebook. It uses a variety of libraries and functions to perform image style transfer. Here's a brief explanation of what each part of the code does:

    1. The first part imports the necessary libraries.
    2. The second part sets the backend for the Keras library.
    3. The third part displays a style sheet for the webpage.
    4. The fourth part loads the original and style images.
    5. The fifth part resizes the images to a common size.
    6. The sixth part plots the original and style images.
    7. The seventh part defines a function to preprocess the images.
    8. The eighth part defines a function to deprocess the images.
    9. The ninth part prepares the transfer image and computes the loss and gradients.
    10. The tenth part runs the optimization process.
    11. The eleventh part displays the final result.

    Please note that the code provided is a simplified version of the process and may not work as expected. It's a starting point and you may need to adjust it according to your specific needs.
