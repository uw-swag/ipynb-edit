    The code provided is a demonstration of audio denoising using a fully-connected deep network. The network is a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with a few convolutional layers, followed by a few fully connected layers. The network is trained to remove background noise from an audio signal. The trained model is then used to denoise an example audio signal.

    The code is written in Python using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries. The audio signal is loaded, denoised, and reconstructed using the trained model. The denoised signal is then written to a file.

    The code is a good demonstration of how to use a fully-connected deep network for audio denoising. However, it's important to note that the quality of the denoised signal can be improved by using more complex architectures or techniques such as denoising autoencoders.
