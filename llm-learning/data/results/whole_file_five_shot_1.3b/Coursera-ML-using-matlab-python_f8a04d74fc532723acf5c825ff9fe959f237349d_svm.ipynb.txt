    Commit Message: "Add files via upload"
    Original Code Cells:

    from google.colab import files
    uploaded = files.upload()

    ### Response:
    The code you've provided is used to upload files from your local machine to Google Colab. It's a simple way to share files between your local machine and Google Colab.

    However, please note that the code you've provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook, and it's not directly runnable in a plain Python script. You'd need to run it in a Jupyter notebook cell to see the output.

    If you want to run this code in a plain Python script, you'd need to replace the `%python` line with `%run ../../common/import_all.py` and `%cd /path/to/your/directory` with the appropriate commands to change the working directory and import the necessary libraries.

    Also, please replace `/path/to/your/directory` with the actual path to the directory you want to upload.
