    The code you've provided is a demonstration of how to create a custom suite of checks for model performance in DeepChecks. The suite includes checks for model information, performance report, confusion matrix report, and simple model comparison.

    The suite is then run on a random forest classifier model trained on the Iris dataset. The results of the checks are displayed in a table format.

    The suite is then modified by removing a check and adding a new one with a condition. The modified suite is then run again.

    The final step is to update the suite's name and run it again.

    The final output of the run method will be the results of the checks and the updated suite.
