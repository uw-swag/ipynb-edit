    The code you provided is a demonstration of how to use the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check in DeepChecks. The check is designed to detect duplicates in the training and test datasets, which could be caused by a leakage in the data.

    The first example uses the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check to find duplicates in the training dataset. The second example uses the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check to find duplicates in the test dataset.

    The duplicates found in the test dataset are not present in the training dataset, which is a clear indication of a leakage.

    Please note that the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check is a part of the DeepChecks methodology, which is a collection of checks designed to validate the quality of machine learning models.

    The code you provided is a part of a larger example, which demonstrates how to use the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check in a DeepChecks pipeline.
