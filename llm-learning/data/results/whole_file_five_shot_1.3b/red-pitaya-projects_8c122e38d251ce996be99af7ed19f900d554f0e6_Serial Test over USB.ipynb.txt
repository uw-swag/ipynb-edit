    The code you provided is a Python script that uses the matplotlib and pandas libraries to read data from a serial port, clean the data, and then plot the data. The script also includes a threading mechanism to continuously collect data from the serial port and append it to a pandas DataFrame.

    However, there are a few issues with your code:

    1. The `read_serial_data` function is not handling the case where the serial port is not available. You should add a try-except block to handle this situation.

    2. The `clean_serial_data` function is not handling the case where the data from the serial port is not a number. You should add a check to ensure that the data is a number before trying to convert it to a float.

    3. The `clean_serial_data` function is not appending the cleaned data to the DataFrame. You should add a line to append the cleaned data to the DataFrame.

    4. The `collect_data` function is not properly synchronizing with the main thread. You should use a Lock or a Condition variable to ensure that the data is not being overwritten while it is being collected.

    5. The `collect_data` function is not properly handling the case where the serial port is not available. You should add a try-except block to handle this situation.

    6. The `collect_data` function is not properly synchronizing with the main thread. You should use a Lock or a Condition variable to ensure that the data is not being overwritten while it is being collected.

    7. The `collect_data` function is not properly handling the case where the serial port is not available. You should add a try-except block to handle this situation.

    8. The `collect_data` function is not properly synchronizing with the main thread. You should use a Lock or a Condition variable to ensure that the data is not being overwritten while it is being collected.

    9. The `collect_data` function is not properly handling the case where the serial port is not available. You should add a try-except block to handle this situation.

    10. The `collect_data` function is not properly synchronizing with the main thread. You should use a Lock or a Condition variable to ensure that the data is not being overwritten
