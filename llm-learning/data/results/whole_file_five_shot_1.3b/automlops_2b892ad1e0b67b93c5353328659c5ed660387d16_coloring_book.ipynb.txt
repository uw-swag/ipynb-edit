    The notebook you've shared is a mix of Python code and Jupyter notebook markdown cells. It includes several components, such as:

    - Installing necessary libraries
    - Defining components for data loading, model training, and model deployment
    - Defining a pipeline for the components
    - Running the pipeline with some parameters

    The notebook is designed to be interactive and allows users to run the components individually or in a pipeline. The components are defined in Python code, which is executed when the notebook is run.

    However, the notebook is not complete and there are some missing cells. The missing cells are:

    - The last cell in the notebook is incomplete. It should contain the code to run the pipeline with the specified parameters.

    Please provide the complete notebook and I'll be happy to help you with it.
