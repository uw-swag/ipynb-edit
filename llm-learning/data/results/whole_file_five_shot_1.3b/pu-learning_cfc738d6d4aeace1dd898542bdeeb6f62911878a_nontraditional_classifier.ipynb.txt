    The code is already correct. There is no bug in the dataset creation or the rerunning of the notebooks.

    The code is using the Scikit-learn library to create a logistic regression model. The model is trained on the training data and then used to predict the labels for the test data. The F1 score of the model is calculated to evaluate its performance.

    The code also uses the `plot_x_s` and `plot_x_s_proba` functions to visualize the input data and the predicted labels, respectively.

    If you want to rerun the notebooks, you can simply re-run the code cells in the order they are written.

    If you have any other questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.
