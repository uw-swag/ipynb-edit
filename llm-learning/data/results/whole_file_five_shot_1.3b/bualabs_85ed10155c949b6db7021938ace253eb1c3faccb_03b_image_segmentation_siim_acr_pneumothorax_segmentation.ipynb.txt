```python
    from fastbook import *
    from fastai.vision.all import *

    # Load the data
    path = untar_data(URLs.PNEUMONIA_SIIM_ACR)
    dls = ImageDataLoaders.from_folder(path)

    # Define the model
    learn = vision_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=accuracy)

    # Train the model
    learn.fit_one_cycle(10)

    # Predict on a sample image
    img = open_image(path/'1.jpeg')
    pred_class, pred_idx, outputs = learn.predict(img)

    # Display the results
    print(f"Predicted class: {pred_class}")
    print(f"Predicted index: {pred_idx}")
    print(f"Outputs: {outputs}")
    ```
    Please note that you need to have the fastbook and fastai libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
    ```
    pip install fastbook fastai
    ```
    Also, the URLs.PNEUMONIA_SIIM_ACR is a placeholder URL, you need to replace it with the actual URL of the dataset you want to use.
