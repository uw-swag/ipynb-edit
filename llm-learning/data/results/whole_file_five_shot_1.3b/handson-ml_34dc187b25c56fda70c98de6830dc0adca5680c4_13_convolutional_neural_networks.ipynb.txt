    The code you've provided seems to be a part of a larger project, and it's not clear what the specific bug is. However, it seems to be related to the order of operations in the code. The code is trying to load an image, apply a filter to it, and then save the result. The filter is applied in a vertical and horizontal way, but the result is not displayed in the correct order.

    If you're experiencing a bug, it would be helpful to have more context or details about the problem. For example, are you getting any errors? Are the results not as expected? If so, what are the expected results?

    If you're not experiencing a bug, it might be a mistake in the code. The code seems to be missing some parts, or the parts are not in the correct order. If you can provide the correct code, I'd be happy to help debug it.
