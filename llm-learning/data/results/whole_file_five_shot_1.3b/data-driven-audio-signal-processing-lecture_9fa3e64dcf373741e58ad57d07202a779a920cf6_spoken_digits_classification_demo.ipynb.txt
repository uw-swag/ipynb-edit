    The path for the binder service is not specified in the original code. It seems like the binder service is not used in the provided code. If you're using a binder service, you should specify the path to the dataset in the code.

    If you're not using a binder service, you can remove the line that sets the path to the dataset.

    If you're using a Jupyter notebook, you can use the `%cd` magic command to change the current working directory to the path of the notebook. For example, `%cd ../data/free-spoken-digit-dataset/recordings/`.

    If you're using a different service, you should refer to the documentation for that service to understand how to set the path to the dataset.
