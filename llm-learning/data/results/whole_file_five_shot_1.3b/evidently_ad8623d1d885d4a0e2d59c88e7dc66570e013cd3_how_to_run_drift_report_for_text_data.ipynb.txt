    The code you provided is a mix of Python and Jupyter notebook cells. It includes importing necessary libraries, loading datasets, performing some data preprocessing, and finally, using the `EmbeddingsDriftMetric` to measure the drift between two datasets.

    The code is divided into several cells, each one performing a specific task. For example, cell 1 imports the necessary libraries, cell 2 loads the IMBD reviews dataset, cell 3 loads the echo dot dataset, and so on.

    The `EmbeddingsDriftMetric` is used to measure the drift between the small subset of the IMBD reviews dataset and the echo dot dataset. The `drift_method` parameter is set to `model`, which uses the model's Wasserstein distance to measure the difference between the embeddings.

    The `run` method of the `Report` object is used to generate a report that includes the metrics for the `EmbeddingsDriftMetric`.

    The report is then printed to the console.

    The code also includes several cells that perform different operations on the IMBD reviews dataset, such as encoding the reviews, creating a dataframe, and running a report.

    The code also includes several cells that load a pre-trained GloVe model, encode the reviews, and run a report.

    The code also includes several cells that measure the drift between different subsets of the IMBD reviews dataset, such as the first 100 reviews, the first 500 reviews, and the entire dataset.

    The code also includes several cells that use different drift methods, such as the model's Wasserstein distance, the Mean Squared Error, the Chebyshev distance, and the ratio of the embeddings.

    The code also includes several cells that encode the echo dot dataset and run a report.

    The code also includes several cells that load a pre-trained MiniLM v2 model, encode the reviews, and run a report.

    The code also includes several cells that measure the drift between different subsets of the echo dot dataset, such as the first 100 reviews, the first 500 reviews, and the entire dataset.
