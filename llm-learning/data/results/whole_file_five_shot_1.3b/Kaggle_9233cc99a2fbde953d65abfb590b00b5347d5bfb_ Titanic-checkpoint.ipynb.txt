The code you provided is a series of Jupyter notebook cells that are used to perform various tasks such as data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training. Here are the metrics you mentioned:

1. **Age**: This is a numerical feature in the dataset. It's important to understand the distribution of ages to make accurate predictions. The mean and standard deviation of the age distribution can be calculated and plotted.

2. **Fare**: This is also a numerical feature in the dataset. It's important to understand the distribution of fares to make accurate predictions. The mean and standard deviation of the fare distribution can be calculated and plotted.

3. **Embarked**: This is a categorical feature in the dataset. It's important to understand the distribution of embarked ports to make accurate predictions. The count of passengers in each port can be plotted.

4. **Sex**: This is a categorical feature in the dataset. It's important to understand the distribution of sex to make accurate predictions. The count of passengers in each sex can be plotted.

5. **Pclass**: This is a categorical feature in the dataset. It's important to understand the distribution of passenger classes to make accurate predictions. The count of passengers in each class can be plotted.

6. **Survived**: This is a binary target variable in the dataset. It's important to understand the distribution of survival rates to make accurate predictions. The count of passengers who survived and didn't survive can be plotted.

7. **Parch**: This is a numerical feature in the dataset. It's important to understand the relationship between the number of parents/children aboard and survival to make accurate predictions. The count of passengers with each number of parents/children can be plotted.

8. **SibSp**: This is a numerical feature in the dataset. It's important to understand the relationship between the number of siblings/spouses aboard and survival to make accurate predictions. The count of passengers with each number of siblings/spouses can be plotted.

9. **Fare**: This is a numerical feature in the dataset. It's important to understand the distribution of fares to make accurate predictions. The mean and standard deviation of the fare distribution can be calculated and plotted.

10. **Cabin**: This
