The code snippet you provided is a demonstration of how to use the DeepChecks library to perform a check on a DataFrame to identify mixed nulls (NaNs, None values, or 'null' strings).

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. The first code snippet is a simple demonstration of how to use the `MixedNulls` check in DeepChecks to identify mixed null values in a DataFrame.

2. The second code snippet demonstrates how to use the `MixedNulls` check to identify mixed null values in a DataFrame. The DataFrame contains null values in different formats (NaN, None, 'null', 'Nan', '1', 'cat').

The `MixedNulls` check will return a report of the null values in the DataFrame, and the report will show the number of null values, the percentage of null values, and the types of null values.

Please note that you need to have the DeepChecks library installed in your environment to run this code. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install deepchecks
```
