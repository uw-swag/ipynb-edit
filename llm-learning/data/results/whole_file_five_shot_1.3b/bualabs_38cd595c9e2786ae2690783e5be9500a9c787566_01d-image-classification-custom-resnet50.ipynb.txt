    ## Hyperparameter tuning
    # The hyperparameters of the model are tuned using GridSearchCV.
    # The parameters to be tuned are:
    # 1. n_estimators: The number of estimators in the model.
    # 2. max_depth: The maximum depth of the tree.
    # 3. learning_rate: The learning rate shrinks the coefficients of the terms by learning_rate.
    # 4. min_samples_split: The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.
    # 5. min_samples_leaf: The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
    # 6. max_features: The number of features to consider when looking for the best split.
    # 7. bootstrap: Whether or not to use bootstrap samples.
    # 8. max_features: The number of features to consider when looking for the best split.
    # 9. n_jobs: The number of jobs to run in parallel.
    # 10. random_state: Random state for reproducibility.

    ## Model training
    # The model is trained using the training data.

    ## Model evaluation
    # The model's performance is evaluated using the test data.

    ## Model prediction
    # The model is used to predict the output for the test data.
