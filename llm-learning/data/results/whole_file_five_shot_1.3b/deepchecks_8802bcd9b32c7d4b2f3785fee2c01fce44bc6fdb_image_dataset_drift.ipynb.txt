The code you've provided is a series of operations that are performed on a dataset. The first part imports the necessary libraries and classes. The second part loads a dataset from the COCO dataset. The third part creates a new class that extends the ImageDatasetDrift class and overrides the batch_to_images method to add brightness to each image in the batch. The fourth part creates a dataloader for the training and testing datasets. The fifth part creates a new instance of the DriftedCOCO class and runs the ImageDatasetDrift check on the new datasets.

The code is not deleting any notebooks. It's just deleting the notebooks that were created during the execution of the code. The notebooks are not deleted, they are just hidden from the notebook interface. If you want to delete them, you can do so by navigating to the Jupyter notebook interface, selecting the notebook, and clicking on the "Delete" button.
