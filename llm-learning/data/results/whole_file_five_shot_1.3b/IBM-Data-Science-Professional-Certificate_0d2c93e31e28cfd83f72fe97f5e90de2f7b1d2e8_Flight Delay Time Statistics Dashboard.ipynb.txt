    The code provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the Dash library to create a web application for visualizing flight delay time statistics. The application takes an input year from a slider and displays various charts and plots for the selected year. The data is loaded from a CSV file and processed using a helper function `compute_info`. The application is then run using the JupyterDash.infer_jupyter_proxy_config() method.

    The notebook is designed to be run in a Jupyter notebook environment. The application is designed to be run in an inline mode, which means it will be displayed in the notebook itself. The host and port parameters in the app.run_server() method are set to "localhost" and 7645 respectively, which means the application will be available at http://localhost:7645. The debug parameter is set to True, which means any errors that occur during the execution of the application will be displayed in the notebook.
