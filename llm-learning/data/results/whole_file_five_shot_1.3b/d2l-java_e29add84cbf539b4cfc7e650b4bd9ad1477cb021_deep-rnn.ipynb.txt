The provided code is a part of a Jupyter notebook and it's using a number of libraries and utilities for time-series analysis and machine learning. The build time of the code is reduced by reducing the number of lines and the complexity of the code.

However, the actual reduction in build time can depend on the specifics of the machine running the code and the configuration of the machine. It's also possible that the code is not actually reducing the build time, but rather improving the performance of the code.

The code is currently set to build a model for a time-series analysis task using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The LSTM model is a type of recurrent neural network that is particularly well-suited for tasks that require sequential data, such as time series analysis.

The build time of the code is currently quite high, as it involves a lot of operations and computations. The actual reduction in build time can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the specific hardware and software configuration of the machine running the code, the complexity of the code, and the size of the dataset being used.

In order to reduce the build time, you might want to consider the following:

1. Optimize the code: Look for ways to make the code more efficient. This could involve reducing the number of operations, using more efficient algorithms, or using more memory.

2. Use more efficient data structures: If possible, using more efficient data structures can help to reduce the build time.

3. Use a more powerful machine: If possible, using a machine with more powerful hardware can also help to reduce the build time.

4. Parallelize the code: If the code is not already parallelized, parallelizing it can help to reduce the build time.

Remember, reducing the build time is not always a good thing, as it can make the code slower to run. It's often more important to make the code as efficient as possible.
