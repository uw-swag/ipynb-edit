    ### Response:
    The code you provided is already up-to-date. The dataset properties have been updated to include the 'sex' category. The 'target' column in the 'train_df' DataFrame has been increased by 150 to ensure the target variable is not only a continuous variable but also a categorical variable. The 'train' and 'test' DataFrames are now correctly formatted for the DeepChecks library.

    The 'RegressionSystematicError' check is also correctly defined and can be run on the 'test' dataset with the trained model 'clf'.

    However, please note that the DeepChecks library is still
