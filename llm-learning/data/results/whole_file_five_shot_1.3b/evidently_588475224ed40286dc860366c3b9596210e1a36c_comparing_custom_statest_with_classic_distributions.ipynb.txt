    The code you've provided is a mix of Python and Jupyter notebook markdown cells. It's not a complete script, but it's a good starting point for a Jupyter notebook.

    The code is importing necessary libraries, defining functions, and running statistical tests on data. The results are then plotted using Plotly.

    Please provide more specific instructions or examples if you need help with something else.
