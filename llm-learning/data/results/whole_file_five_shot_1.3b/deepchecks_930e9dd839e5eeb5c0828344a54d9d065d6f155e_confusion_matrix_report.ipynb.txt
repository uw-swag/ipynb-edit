    ## Updating Readme(s) and Iris example notebook (#181)

    This section is for updating the README.md file and the Iris example notebook.

    ### Updating README.md file

    - [ ] Update the README.md file with the latest information about the Iris dataset, the Iris example notebook, and the process of using the Iris dataset in a machine learning model.

    ### Updating Iris example notebook

    - [ ] Update the Iris example notebook with the latest information about the Iris dataset, the Iris example notebook, and the process of using the Iris dataset in a machine learning model.

    ## Iris example notebook

    The Iris example notebook is a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use the Iris dataset in a machine learning model.

    The notebook starts with importing necessary libraries, loads the Iris dataset, and explores it. It then splits the dataset into a training set and a test set, and trains a model on the training set. Finally, it makes predictions on the test set and evaluates the model.

    The notebook is designed to be interactive and allows users to explore the data, select different features, and compare the performance of different models.

    The notebook is also equipped with a section for visualizing the decision boundaries of different models, which can help users understand the impact of different features on the model's decision.

    The notebook is designed to be user-friendly and easy to follow, with clear instructions and examples.

    The notebook is also equipped with a section for comparing the performance of different models, which can help users choose the best model for their specific task.

    The notebook is also equipped with a section for evaluating the model's performance, which can help users understand how well the model is performing.

    The notebook is designed to be reproducible, which means that it can be run in any environment that has Python, Jupyter notebook, and the necessary libraries installed.

    The notebook is also equipped with a section for saving and loading the model, which can help users save their work and load it for future use.

    The notebook is designed to be accessible,
