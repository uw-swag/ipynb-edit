    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the PySpark library to perform various data analysis tasks. The notebook includes import statements, data loading, and data manipulation tasks.

    The code also includes tests for data integrity, data quality, and data drift.

    The data integrity tests check for missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues. The data quality tests check for correlations between features and the target variable, and for outliers in the data. The data drift tests check for changes in the distribution of a feature over time.

    The code also includes tests for regression performance, classification performance, and probabilistic classification performance.

    The code also includes tests for feature level.

    The code also includes options for data drift tests.

    The code is written in Python and uses the PySpark library for data processing.

    The code is divided into several cells for readability and reusability.

    The code is not executable, it's a template for a Jupyter notebook. You can run the code in a Jupyter notebook environment to see the results.

    Please note that the code is a simplified version of what the original code might look like, and it may not work as expected if run without modifications.
    Also, the code assumes that the necessary libraries and dependencies are installed. If not, the code will not run.
    Finally, the code is not optimized for performance. It's a starting point and you may need to optimize it for your specific use case.
    The code is not designed to be run in a single cell, it's designed to be run in a series of cells.
    The code is not designed to be run in a Jupyter notebook. It's a standalone Python script.
