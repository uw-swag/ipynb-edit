The code provided is a notebook that demonstrates the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for function approximation. The notebook starts by importing necessary libraries and defining a function to load the examples from a directory. The function then loads the audio files, extracts the MFCC features, and reshapes the data.

The DNN model is defined, compiled, and trained using the training data. The model's performance is evaluated using a classification report.

The notebook also includes a function to plot the training and validation loss and accuracy over epochs.

The notebook ends with a classification report showing the performance of the model on the test set.
