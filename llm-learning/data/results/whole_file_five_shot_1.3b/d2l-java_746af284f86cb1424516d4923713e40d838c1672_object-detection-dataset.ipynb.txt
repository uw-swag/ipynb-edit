    The `showImages` method in the code is used to display a list of images. The method takes in an array of `Image` objects, the number of images to display, the width and height of the images, the scale of the images, and a `NDManager` object.

    The method creates a new JFrame and adds a `ImagePanel` for each image in the array. The `ImagePanel` is scaled to the specified size and drawn on the JFrame. The `showImages` method then displays the JFrame.

    The `showImages` method is called with the `imageArr` array, 10, 256, 256, 1, and the `NDManager` object.

    The `showImages` method is called within a loop that iterates over the `trainIter` dataset. The `trainIter` dataset is a `BananaDetection` object that is prepared and ready to be used.

    The `trainIter` dataset is iterated over in a loop that runs 10 times. For each iteration, the `trainIter` dataset is fetched and the `imageArr` array is populated with the fetched images.

    The `showImages` method is then called with the `imageArr` array, 10, 256, 256, 1, and the `NDManager` object.

    The `showImages` method is called within another loop that iterates over the `trainIter` dataset. The `trainIter` dataset is a `BananaDetection` object that is prepared and ready to be used.
