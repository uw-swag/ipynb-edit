The code you provided seems to be a set of functions and methods for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training. However, there are a few issues with the code:

1. The `LeftRightHemisphereFeatures` function seems to be missing the `leftRightHemisphericChannels` and `featureExtractionLeftRight` functions. These functions are not defined in the provided code.

2. The `LeftRightHemisphereTrainTestData` function seems to be missing the `createTrainingAndTestDatasets` function. This function is not defined in the provided code.

3. The `LeftRightHemispheresExperiment` function seems to be missing the `CompleteSVM`, `CompleteKNN`, `CompleteNB`, `CompleteDT`, `CompleteRF`, `CompleteLDA`, `CompleteLR`, and `CompleteLSTM` functions. These functions are not defined in the provided code.

4. The `LeftRightHemispheresExperiment` function seems to be missing the `smote_features` variable. This variable is not defined in the provided code.

5. The `LeftRightHemispheresExperiment` function seems to be missing the `kf` variable. This variable is not defined in the provided code.

6. The `LeftRightHemispheresExperiment` function seems to be missing the `perfInd` variable. This variable is not defined in the provided code.

7. The `LeftRightHemispheresExperiment` function seems to be missing the `train_ind` and `test_ind` variables. These variables are not defined in the provided code.

8. The `LeftRightHemispheresExperiment` function seems to be missing the `results` variable. This variable is not defined in the provided code.

9. The `LeftRightHemispheresExperiment` function seems to be missing the `k_fold` variable. This variable is not defined in the provided code.

10. The `LeftRightHemispheresExperiment` function seems to be missing the `knn_neighbors`, `rf_estimators`, `max_iter`, `dropout`, `loss_function`, `epochs`, `lstm_units`,
