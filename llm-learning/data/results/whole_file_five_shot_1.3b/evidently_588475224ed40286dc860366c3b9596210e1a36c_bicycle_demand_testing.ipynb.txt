    The code you've provided is a part of a larger codebase and it's not clear what the purpose of the code is. It seems to be a part of a data analysis project, specifically dealing with bike sharing dataset. The code is using various machine learning algorithms to predict bike sharing counts based on various features.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    1. The code imports necessary libraries and modules.
    2. It downloads the bike sharing dataset from a UCI repository and loads it into a pandas DataFrame.
    3. It sets up the environment for the notebook, including setting up matplotlib and setting up the CSS style.
    4. It defines the target variable (the number of bike rentals) and the prediction variable (the predicted number of bike rentals).
    5. It defines the numerical and categorical features.
    6. It splits the data into a reference dataset and a current dataset.
    7. It fits a random forest regressor to the reference dataset and makes predictions on the current dataset.
    8. It creates a column mapping and a regression performance report.
    9. It runs the regression performance test and displays the results.
    10. It creates a data drift test and runs it.
    11. It runs the regression and data drift tests and displays the results.

    The code seems to be a part of a larger data analysis project, and it's unclear what the purpose of the code is. It's not clear what the target variable is, what the prediction variable is, what the numerical and categorical features are, and what the goal of the code is.

    Please provide more context or clarify what you're trying to achieve with this code.
