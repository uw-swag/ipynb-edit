    ## Completed Table Relations and Normalization

    ## Table Relations

    ## 1. The 'car_data' table has a foreign key 'CLASS' that references the 'class_data' table. This is a one-to-many relationship.
    ## 2. The 'plane_data' table has a foreign key 'CLASS' that references the 'class_data' table. This is a one-to-many relationship.

    ## Table Normalization

    ## 1. The 'class_data' table is normalized to ensure data integrity and consistency.
    ## 2. The 'car_data' and 'plane_data' tables are normalized to ensure data integrity and consistency.
