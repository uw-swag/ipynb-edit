    The code you provided is a Python script that uses several libraries to perform various tasks. Here's a brief overview of what each part of the code does:

    1. **Importing necessary libraries**: The script imports several Python libraries that are used for various tasks, such as pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computations, and matplotlib for data visualization.

    2. **Uploading files**: The script uploads a file from Google Colab to the local machine. This is used to download data files from a remote location.

    3. **Reading CSV files**: The script reads two CSV files, 'links.csv' and 'chefkoch.csv', and prints the number of rows in each file.

    4. **Data manipulation**: The script calculates the number of links and removes some values from the list.

    5. **Levenshtein similarity**: The script calculates the similarity between two strings using the Levenshtein distance algorithm.

    6. **Removing values from a list**: The script removes certain values from a list.

    7. **Similarity calculation**: The script calculates the similarity between the title and partial IDs.

    8. **Matching recipes**: The script matches the recipes based on the similarity between the title and partial IDs.

    9. **Writing to a file**: The script writes the matches to a file.

    10. **Authenticating and uploading to Google Drive**: The script authenticates with Google Drive and uploads the matches file to a Google Drive folder.

    Please note that the script is a part of a larger project and it's not clear what all the code does.
