```python
    # Import necessary libraries
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

    # Load the dataset
    df = pd.read_csv('<path_to_your_dataset>')

    # Preprocess the data
    # This step depends on the structure of your dataset.
    # For example, you might need to handle missing values,
    # convert categorical variables into numerical ones,
    # normalize numerical variables, etc.

    # Split the data into features and target
    X = df.drop('<column_name_of_target>', axis=1)
    y = df['<column_name_of_target>']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Standardize the features
    sc = StandardScaler()
    X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = sc.transform(X_test)

    # Train a Random Forest Classifier
    classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=200, random_state=42)
    classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model
    print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
    print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
    ```

    Please replace `<path_to_your_dataset>` and `<column_name_of_target>` with the actual path to your dataset and the name of the column that contains the target variable, respectively.

    Also, the preprocessing step is a placeholder and might need to be adjusted based on the specifics of your dataset.
