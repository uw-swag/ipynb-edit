    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the Deepchecks library to perform a feature drift check on a dataset. The notebook starts by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset. Then, it performs a feature drift check on the dataset. The check is performed on the 'numeric_with_drift' and 'categorical_with_drift' features. The result of the check is printed out.

    The code is not complete and there are some missing cells. The missing cells are:

    1. The code for the feature drift check.
    2. The code for the condition for the feature drift check.
    3. The code for the pprint of the condition for the feature drift check.

    The missing cells are due to the fact that the Deepchecks library does not have a function to add a condition for the feature drift check.
