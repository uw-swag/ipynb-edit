    # Deleting notebooks
    ```
    The notebooks you've mentioned are not related to the code you've provided. If you're looking to delete them, you can do so by navigating to the Jupyter notebook file location and deleting the .ipynb file.

    However, if you're referring to the code you've provided, here's how you can delete them:

    1. Open the Jupyter notebook file you want to delete.
    2. Go to the menu bar and select `File -> Download as -> Notebook (.ipynb)`.
    3. Save the file with a different name.
    4. Open the saved file and delete the cells you want to keep.
    5. Save the notebook again.

    Please note that this will only delete the code, not the notebook file itself.
