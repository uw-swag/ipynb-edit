The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook and it's using the Deepchecks library to detect and handle duplicates in a dataset.

The first part of the code is defining a function `dataset_from_dict` that takes a dictionary and a datetime name as input and returns a `Dataset` object. The `Dataset` object is a high-level interface for working with datasets in Deepchecks.

The second part of the code is using the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check to find duplicates in the training dataset. The `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check is a methodology check that identifies duplicates in the training dataset.

The third part of the code is using the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check to find duplicates in the test dataset. The `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check is a methodology check that identifies duplicates in the test dataset.

The fourth part of the code is using the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check to find duplicates in the training dataset. The `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check is a methodology check that identifies duplicates in the training dataset.

The fifth part of the code is using the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check to find duplicates in the test dataset. The `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check is a methodology check that identifies duplicates in the test dataset.

The sixth part of the code is using the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check to find duplicates in the training dataset. The `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check is a methodology check that identifies duplicates in the training dataset.

The seventh part of the code is using the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check to find duplicates in the test dataset. The `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check is a methodology check that identifies duplicates in the test dataset.

The eighth part of the code is using the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check to find duplicates in the training dataset. The `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplic
