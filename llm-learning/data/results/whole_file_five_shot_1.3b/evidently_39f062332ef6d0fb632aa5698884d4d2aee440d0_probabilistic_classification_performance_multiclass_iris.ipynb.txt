The code you provided is a dummy metrics section for a classification problem in the Iris dataset. It's not doing any actual metrics calculation, but it's creating a dashboard and a profile for the classification performance.

The dashboard is a visualization tool that allows you to compare the performance of a model (in this case, a logistic regression model) on a dataset. The profile section of the dashboard provides a detailed report of the model's performance, including metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.

The metrics calculated in the dummy metrics section are dummy metrics, meaning they don't provide any meaningful information or insights. They're used here for demonstration purposes and to show how the dashboard and profile sections can be used.
