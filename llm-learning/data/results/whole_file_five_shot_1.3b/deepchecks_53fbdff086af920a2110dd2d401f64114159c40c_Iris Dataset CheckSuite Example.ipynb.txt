    The notebook has been split into several chapters as per the commit message. Here are the explanations for each chapter:

1. **Importing necessary libraries and setting a seed for reproducibility**: This chapter imports the necessary libraries and sets a seed for reproducibility.

2. **Loading and preparing the iris dataset**: This chapter loads the iris dataset, splits it into a training set and a test set, and defines the label column.

3. **Training a Random Forest classifier**: This chapter trains a Random Forest classifier on the training set.

4. **Initializing DeepChecks**: This chapter initializes the DeepChecks library.

5. **Creating datasets for DeepChecks**: This chapter creates datasets for DeepChecks.

6. **Running the DeepChecks suite**: This chapter runs the DeepChecks suite on the training and test datasets.

7. **Creating an alternative train-test split**: This chapter creates an alternative train-test split for the iris dataset.

8. **Running the DeepChecks suite on the alternative train-test split**: This chapter runs the DeepChecks suite on the alternative train-test split.

9. **Initializing the CheckSuite**: This chapter initializes the CheckSuite.

10. **Checking the built-in performance checks**: This chapter checks the built-in performance checks in the DeepChecks library.

11. **Initializing the MyModelSuite**: This chapter initializes the MyModelSuite.

12. **Running the MyModelSuite**: This chapter runs the MyModelSuite on the trained model.

Each chapter is designed to be self-contained and to explain a specific task or concept in the notebook.
