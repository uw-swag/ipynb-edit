    ### Reorganisation of Examples

    The examples have been reorganised to better fit the structure of the documentation. Each section now represents a different aspect of the application, such as the user interface, the data processing, or the machine learning algorithms.

    ### Moving GitBook Docs to Repo

    The GitBook documentation has been moved to the repository. This allows for easier access, version control, and collaboration.

    ## User Interface

    This section will contain examples of how to use the user interface of the application.

    ## Data Processing

    This section will contain examples of how to process data using the application.

    ## Machine Learning Algorithms

    This section will contain examples of how to use the machine learning algorithms in the application.

    ## Other Examples

    This section will contain any other examples that may be needed for the documentation.

    ## References

    This section will contain any references that have been used in the creation of the documentation.
