The code you've provided is a mix of Python and Jupyter notebook cells. It's a mix of Python code, Jupyter notebook cells, and some code that appears to be part of a larger program or script. 

The code is using a number of Python libraries and modules, including:

- `numpy` for numerical computations
- `matplotlib` for plotting
- `torch` for deep learning
- `pickle` for loading and saving pickled objects
- `os` for operating system-related functions
- `sys` for system-related functions
- `papermill` for notebook-to-notebook communication
- `data` from `torchtext` for text data processing
- `agglomeration` from `acd` for some specific functions
- `viz_1d`, `tiling_1d`, `agg_1d`, `cd`, `score_funcs` from `acd` for some specific functions
- `LSTMSentiment` from `dsets.sst` for sentiment analysis
- `B` from `dsets.sst` for defining a class
- `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` from `torch.nn` for defining a loss function
- `O.SGD` from `torch.optim` for defining an optimizer
- `data.BucketIterator` from `torchtext.data` for creating iterators for training, validation, and testing data
- `torch.load` for loading models
- `torch.zeros`, `torch.transpose`, `torch.abs`, `torch.mean`, `torch.cat`, `torch.nn.functional.softmax`, `np.random.randint`, `start`, `stop` from `numpy`
- `cd.cd_batch_text`, `cd.cd_penalty`, `cd.cd_text`, `model1.forward`, `model2.forward`, `model1.hidden_to_label.bias.data`, `dev_batch.text.shape`, `dev_batch.text.data`, `rel`, `irrel` from
