    The code you provided is a set of examples for the Deepchecks library, which is a library for data quality checks in Python. The examples are related to the Deepchecks library and the NewLabelTrainTest check, which is a custom check for training and testing datasets.

    The first two examples are related to the NewLabelTrainTest check, which is a custom check for training and testing datasets. The check is used to ensure that the label column in the training and testing datasets are of the same type.

    The last two examples are related to the Deepchecks library, which is a library for data quality checks in Python. The examples are used to create and run a custom check for training and testing datasets.

    The check is used to ensure that the label column in the training and testing datasets are of the same type.

    Please note that the Deepchecks library is not installed in your environment, so you need to install it first. You can do this by running `pip install deepchecks` in your terminal.

    Also, please note that the Deepchecks library is under active development, and the functionality may change over time.
