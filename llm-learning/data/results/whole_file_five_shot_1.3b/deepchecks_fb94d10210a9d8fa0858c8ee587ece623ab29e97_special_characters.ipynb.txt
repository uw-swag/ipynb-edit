    The code you provided is not complete and does not seem to be related to the problem you're trying to solve. 

    However, if you want to find the top 10 most common special characters in the 'col1' column, you can use the following code:

    ```python
    from collections import Counter

    counter = Counter(data['col1'])
    top_10 = counter.most_common(10)

    print(top_10)
    ```

    This will return a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a special character and its count. The first element of the tuple is the special character, and the second element is the count.

    Please provide more context or clarify your question if you need help with a different topic.
