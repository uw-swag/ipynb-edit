    The code you've provided is a mix of Maven commands, Jupyter notebook cells, and Python code. Here's a brief explanation of what each part does:

1. Maven commands: These are used to manage dependencies in a Maven project. The `%maven` commands are used to add dependencies to a Maven project. The `%mavenRepo` command is used to set the repository for Maven. The `%maven` commands are used to add specific versions of dependencies to the project.

2. Jupyter notebook cells: These are used to write and execute Python code. The `<Cell_0>` through `<Cell_15>` are used to import necessary libraries and modules. The `<Cell_1>` through `<Cell_14>` are used to perform various operations on the data. The `<Cell_15>` through `<Cell_16>` are used to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using the DJL library.

3. Python code: This is the main part of the code. It imports necessary libraries, defines the model architecture, trains the model, and evaluates it. It also includes a function to render a line plot of the training data.
