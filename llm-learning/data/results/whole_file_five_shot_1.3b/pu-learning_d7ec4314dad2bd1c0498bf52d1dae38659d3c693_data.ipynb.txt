The code you provided seems to be a part of a larger system, and it seems to be implementing a labeling mechanism for a machine learning model. The bug in the code is that the `propensity_score` function is returning the same value for all examples, which is not correct. The propensity score should be a random value for each example, not the same value for all.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import random

MEAN_P = [3, 3]  # The mean of the positive example's distribution
COV_P = [
    [1, 0],
    [0, 1],
]                # The covariance matrix of the positive example's distribution

MEAN_N = [0, 0]  # The mean of the negative example's distribution
COV_N = [
    [1, 0],
    [0, 1],
]                # The covariance matrix of the positive example's distribution

ALPHA = 0.8      # Class prior


def get_samples(n: int):
    x, y = [], []
    for _ in range(n):
        if random.random() < ALPHA:
            x.append(np.random.multivariate_normal(MEAN_P, COV_P, 1))
            y.append(1)
        else:
            x.append(np.random.multivariate_normal(MEAN_N, COV_N, 1))
            y.append(0)
    return np.concatenate(x), np.asarray(y)

N_TRAIN = 10000  # The number of training examples
N_VALID = 1000   # The number of validation examples
N_TEST = 1000    # The number of test examples

train_xs, train_ys = get_samples(N_TRAIN)
valid_xs, valid_ys = get_samples(N_VALID)
test_xs, test_ys = get_samples(N_TEST)

c = 0.1  # Label frequency

def propensity_score(ys):
