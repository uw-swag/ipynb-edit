    The code you provided is a DeepChecks check that compares the sizes of the train and test datasets. The check is run on a dummy dataset, and the sizes of the train and test datasets are displayed.

    Here's a breakdown of the code:

    - The `DatasetSizeComparison` class inherits from `TrainTestBaseCheck`, which is a base class for all checks that compare the sizes of the train and test datasets.

    - The `run` method of the `DatasetSizeComparison` class is overridden to compare the sizes of the train and test datasets. It first calculates the sizes of the train and test datasets, and then creates a DataFrame to display the sizes.

    - The `display` method of the `CheckResult` class is overridden to display the DataFrame and a bar graph of the sizes.

    - The `DatasetSizeComparison` class is then used to run the check on a dummy dataset.

    The final cell of the code is an example of how to use the `run` method of the `DatasetSizeComparison` class.

    Please note that the code provided is a demonstration and may not work as expected if run without the appropriate dependencies installed.
