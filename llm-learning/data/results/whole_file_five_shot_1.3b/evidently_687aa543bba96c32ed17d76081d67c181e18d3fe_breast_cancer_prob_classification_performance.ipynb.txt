    The code you've provided is a refactoring of a column mapping in a machine learning model. The original code is a series of operations on a breast cancer dataset, including data preprocessing, model training, and visualization of model performance.

    The refactoring involves creating a new dictionary `column_mapping` that maps the column names in the dataset to the desired names. This is a common practice in data preprocessing, especially when working with machine learning models that expect specific column names.

    The refactoring is done in the following cells:

    - Cell 10: Creating the `column_mapping` dictionary.
    - Cell 11: Creating a `Dashboard` object and calculating the model performance.
    - Cell 12: Saving the model performance dashboard to an HTML file.
    - Cell 13: Creating a `Profile` object and calculating the model performance profile.
    - Cell 14: Printing the model performance profile in JSON format.
