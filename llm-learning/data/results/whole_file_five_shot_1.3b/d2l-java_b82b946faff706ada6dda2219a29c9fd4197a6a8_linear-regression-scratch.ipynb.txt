    The section 2.5: Automatic Differentiation (#80) is a topic in machine learning that deals with the automatic differentiation of functions. In this section, we're discussing how to use automatic differentiation to compute gradients, which is a critical step in training machine learning models.

    The automatic differentiation process involves computing the derivative of a function with respect to its input. This is done by setting the derivative equal to 1 and differentiating the function with respect to the input. The result is the gradient of the function, which is a vector of the partial derivatives of the function with respect to its input.

    In the context of machine learning, automatic differentiation is used to compute gradients during the training of neural networks. This is done by computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network.

    The automatic differentiation process is a crucial step in training machine learning models, as it allows us to update the weights of the network in a way that minimizes the loss function.

    The automatic differentiation process is implemented in many machine learning libraries, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, which provide built-in functions for automatic differentiation.

    The automatic differentiation process is also used in the backpropagation algorithm, which is a key algorithm in training neural networks.

    The automatic differentiation process is a fundamental part of the training process in machine learning, and it's used to optimize the weights of the network.
