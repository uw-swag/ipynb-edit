    The commit message "Upgrade to djl 0.13.0 (#176)" is a release note for the Deep Java Library (djl). It includes a new version of the library, 0.13.0, which includes several improvements, bug fixes, and new features.

    The code cells in the commit message are related to the upgrade of the djl library to version 0.13.0. The library is a machine learning library for deep learning models in Java, and the commit message mentions the upgrade to the latest version of the library.

    The new version of the djl library includes several improvements, bug fixes, and new features. For example, the Residual block in the ResNet model is now a class that extends the AbstractBlock class, which provides a more flexible and reusable way to define residual blocks in neural networks.

    The commit also mentions the use of the NDManager class, which is a high-performance, multi-dimensional array library for Java, to handle large-scale data.

    The code cells related to the training of the model on multiple GPUs are also included in the commit message. The model is trained on two GPUs, and the results of the training are displayed in a table format.

    The commit also mentions the use of the LinePlot class, which is a high-performance, multi-dimensional array library for Java, to create line plots. These plots are used to visualize the results of the training process.

    The commit also mentions the use of the Device class, which is a high-performance, multi-dimensional array library for Java, to handle device-specific operations. The library is used to determine the number of GPUs available for the training process.

    The commit also mentions the use of the NormalInitializer class, which is a high-performance, multi-dimensional array library for Java, to initialize the weights of a neural network.

    The commit also mentions the use of the Metrics class, which is a high-performance, multi-dimensional array library for Java, to handle metrics for model evaluation.

    The commit also mentions the use of the EasyTrain class, which is a high-performance, multi-dimensional array library for Java, to train a model.

    The commit also mentions the use of the Accuracy evaluator, which is a
