    The code you provided is a part of a larger codebase and it seems to be related to the DeepChecks library, which is a Python library for data-driven machine learning. The code is moving the base classes for checks from the `deepchecks.core` module to the `deepchecks.tabular` module.

    The `DatasetSizeComparison` class is a check in DeepChecks that compares the sizes of the train and test datasets. The `run_logic` method in this class is where the actual comparison logic is implemented.

    The `TrainTestBaseCheck` class is a base class for all checks that need to compare the sizes of the train and test datasets.

    The `Context` class is a data structure that holds the context for a check, including the train and test datasets.

    The `CheckResult` class is a data structure that holds the result of a check, including the result value and any additional information.

    The `Dataset` class is a data structure that holds a dataset, including the data and any additional information.

    The `Check` class is a base class for all checks, and it provides a method `run` that can be used to run a check on a dataset.

    The `matplotlib.pyplot` module is used to create a bar graph to display the sizes of the train and test datasets.

    The `pd.DataFrame` function is used to create a DataFrame from the sizes dictionary, which is then displayed in a bar graph.

    The `graph_display` function is a function that creates a bar graph of the sizes of the train and test datasets.

    The `run_logic` method in the `DatasetSizeComparison` class is where the actual comparison logic is implemented.

    The `run` method in the `Check` class is used to run a check on a dataset.

    The `run` method in the `DatasetSizeComparison` class is used to run the check.

    The `run` method in the `DatasetSizeComparison` class is used to run the check.

    The `run` method in the `DatasetSizeComparison` class is used to run the check.

    The `run` method in the `DatasetSizeComparison` class is used to run the check.
