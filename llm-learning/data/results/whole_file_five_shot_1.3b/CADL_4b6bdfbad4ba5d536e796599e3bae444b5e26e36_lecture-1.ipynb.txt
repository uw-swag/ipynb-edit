    The code you provided is a collection of Jupyter notebook cells. Each cell is a piece of code that is executed in the order it is presented. The code in each cell is designed to perform a specific task, such as loading a dataset, performing a mathematical operation, or visualizing data.

    Here's a brief explanation of the cells:

    1. Cell_0: This cell imports the necessary libraries for the notebook. It includes matplotlib for plotting, numpy for numerical operations, and tensorflow for machine learning.

    2. Cell_1: This cell imports the `utils` module from the `libs` directory. The `utils` module contains functions for handling various tasks such as getting image files.

    3. Cell_2: This cell loads an image from the `data` directory and prints its shape.

    4. Cell_3: This cell displays the loaded image using matplotlib's `imshow` function.

    5. Cell_4: This cell reshapes the image data to a 3D tensor and prints its shape.

    6. Cell_5: This cell defines the parameters for the Gaussian kernel and computes the Gaussian kernel.

    7. Cell_6: This cell applies the Gaussian kernel to the image and prints the result.

    8. Cell_7: This cell applies the Gaussian kernel to the image and prints the result.

    9. Cell_8: This cell applies the Gaussian kernel to the image and prints the result.

    10. Cell_9: This cell computes the mean of the image and the standard deviation, and prints the result.

    11. Cell_10: This cell applies the Gaussian kernel to the image and prints the result.

    12. Cell_11: This cell applies the Gaussian kernel to the image and prints the result.

    13. Cell_12: This cell applies the Gaussian kernel to the image and prints the result.

    14. Cell_13: This cell computes the convolution of the image and the Gaussian kernel and prints the result.

    15. Cell_14: This cell applies the Gaussian kernel to the image and prints the result.

    16. Cell_15: This cell applies the Gaussian kernel to
