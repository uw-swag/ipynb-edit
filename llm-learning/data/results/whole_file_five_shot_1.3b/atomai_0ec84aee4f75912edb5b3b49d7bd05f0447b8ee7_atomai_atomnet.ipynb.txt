    The code you've provided is a mix of Python and Jupyter notebook cells. It's not clear what the purpose of these cells are. However, they seem to be part of a larger project or script that uses the AtomAI library to train and test a neural network on a dataset.

    Here's a brief explanation of what each cell does:

    1. `<Cell_0>`: This cell installs the AtomAI library using pip.
    2. `<Cell_1>`: This cell imports the necessary libraries.
    3. `<Cell_2>`: This cell downloads a training data set and loads it into the `dataset_1` variable.
    4. `<Cell_3>`: This cell trains a model on the first dataset and stores the trained model in `trained_model_1`.
    5. `<Cell_4>`: This cell uses the trained model to predict atomic coordinates and output for the first dataset.
    6. `<Cell_5>`: This cell plots the atomic coordinates for the first dataset.
    7. `<Cell_6>`: This cell downloads a second training data set and loads it into the `dataset_2` variable.
    8. `<Cell_7>`: This cell trains a model on the second dataset and stores the trained model in `trained_model_2`.
    9. `<Cell_8>`: This cell uses the trained model to predict atomic coordinates and output for the second dataset.
    10. `<Cell_9>`: This cell plots the atomic coordinates for the second dataset.
    11. `<Cell_10>`: This cell is empty.

    Please provide more context or clarify what each cell does.
