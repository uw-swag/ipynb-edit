```
    The code you provided is a PyTorch implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The code includes loading the MNIST dataset, normalizing the data, defining the model, loss function, and training the model.

    The code also includes a cross-entropy loss function and a simple training loop. The code also includes a function to display the model's predictions and the model's performance metrics.

    However, the code you provided is incomplete and does not include the part where the model is trained for a number of epochs. The code also does not include the part where the model's predictions are displayed.

    The code you provided is a good starting point for a CNN in PyTorch. It's a good example of how to use PyTorch for image classification.

    If you need help with a specific part of the code, please provide more details.
