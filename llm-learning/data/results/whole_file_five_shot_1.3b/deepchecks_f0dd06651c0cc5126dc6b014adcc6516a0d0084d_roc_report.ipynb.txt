    The code you provided is already split into multiple files. Each file is responsible for a specific task or functionality. 

    Here's a brief explanation of the files:

    1. `deepchecks.tabular.base`: This file contains the base classes and functions for tabular data.
    2. `sklearn.linear_model`: This file contains the Logistic Regression model from scikit-learn.
    3. `sklearn.datasets`: This file contains the Iris dataset from scikit-learn.
    4. `sklearn.model_selection`: This file contains the train_test_split function.
    5. `deepchecks.tabular.checks.performance`: This file contains the RocReport class, which is used to calculate the ROC curve.
    6. `pandas`: This file contains the pandas library, which is used for data manipulation and analysis.
    7. `warnings`: This file contains the warnings module, which is used to ignore certain warnings.

    The code you provided is a good example of modular programming, where each file is responsible for a specific task or functionality. This makes the code easier to read, maintain, and test.
