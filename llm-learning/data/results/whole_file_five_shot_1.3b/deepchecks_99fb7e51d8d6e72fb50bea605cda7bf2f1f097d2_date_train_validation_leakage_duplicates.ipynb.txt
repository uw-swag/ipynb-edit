The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook and it's using Deepchecks library to detect date leakage conditions. The conditions are:

1. Duplicates: The notebook identifies duplicate dates in the 'col1' column of the dataset.

2. Out-of-range: The notebook identifies dates that are outside the range of the training dataset.

The first code snippet is a function that creates a dataset from a dictionary. The second code snippet is using the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check to detect date leakage conditions in the training and test datasets.

The conditions are:

- Duplicates: The notebook identifies duplicate dates in the 'col1' column of the dataset.
- Out-of-range: The notebook identifies dates that are outside the range of the training dataset.

The second code snippet is using the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check to detect date leakage conditions in the training and test datasets.

Please note that the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check is a part of the Deepchecks library and it's not directly used in the code you provided.
