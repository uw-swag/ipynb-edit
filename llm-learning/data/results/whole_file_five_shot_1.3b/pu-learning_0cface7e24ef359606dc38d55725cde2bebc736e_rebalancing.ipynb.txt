```
    The code you provided seems to be a part of a larger project, and it's not clear what the exact bug is. However, I can see a few potential issues with the code:

    1. The `scar` module is not defined. It seems like the `scar` module is supposed to be a custom module for loading and preprocessing the SARCOS dataset, but it's not defined in the provided code.

    2. The `C` variable is not defined. It's used in the `class_weight` dictionary, but it's not defined in the provided code.

    3. The `f1_score` function is not imported from `sklearn.metrics`.

    4. The `utils` module is not defined. It's used to plot the results, but it's not defined in the provided code.

    5. The `plot_x_y` and `plot_x_y_proba` functions are not imported from the `utils` module.

    6. The `plot_x_y` function is not called. It seems like the function is supposed to plot the results, but it's not called in the provided code.

    7. The `plot_x_y_proba` function is not called. It seems like the function is supposed to plot the predicted probabilities, but it's not called in the provided code.

    8. The `plot_x_y` and `plot_x_y_proba` functions are not called with the correct arguments.

    9. The `plot_x_y_proba` function is not called with the correct arguments.

    Please provide more context or details about the bug for a more accurate diagnosis.
