```python
    from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
    from deepchecks.tabular.checks.overview import ModelInfo

    clf = AdaBoostClassifier(learning_rate=1.2)
    ModelInfo().run(clf)
    ```

    The code above is used to run the ModelInfo check on the AdaBoostClassifier model. The ModelInfo check is a part of the Deepchecks library, which provides a set of pre-defined checks for tabular data. The check is used to get a summary of the model's performance, including the accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.
