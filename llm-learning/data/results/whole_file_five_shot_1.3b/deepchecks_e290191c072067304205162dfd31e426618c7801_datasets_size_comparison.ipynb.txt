    The commit message "[Automatic] Examples Update (#534)" suggests that the examples have been updated.

    The original code cells are not provided, but I can see that they are used to load a dataset, split it into a training and testing set, and then run a check on the dataset.

    The check is used to compare the size of the training and testing datasets. The check is also used to ensure that the size of the testing set is not smaller than the size of the training set, and that the ratio of the size of the training set to the size of the testing set is not smaller than 0.2.

    The commit message also suggests that the examples have been updated, which is a good sign that the code is well-documented and the examples are up-to-date.

    However, the code provided in the commit message is not complete and does not run. It is expected to be completed in the next commit.
