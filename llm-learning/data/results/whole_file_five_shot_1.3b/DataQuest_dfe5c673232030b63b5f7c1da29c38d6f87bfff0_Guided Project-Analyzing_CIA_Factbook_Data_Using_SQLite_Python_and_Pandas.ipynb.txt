```
    pipe1.features.sort(by="importances")[0].sql
    ```

    This command is used to generate the SQL code for the most important features in the first pipeline. The `.sql` method is used to convert the feature importance data into a SQL-formatted string. The most important features are sorted by their importance and the first one is selected.
