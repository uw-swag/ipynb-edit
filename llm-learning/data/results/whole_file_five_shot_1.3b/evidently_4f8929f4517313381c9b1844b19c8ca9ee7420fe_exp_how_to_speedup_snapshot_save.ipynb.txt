```python
    import time
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

    # Load the iris dataset
    iris = load_iris()

    # Create a numpy array with random data
    data = np.random.rand(1000, 10)

    # Start timer
    start_time = time.time()

    # Save the data to a file
    np.save('iris_data.npy', data)

    # End timer
    end_time = time.time()

    # Calculate the save speed
    save_speed = (data.size / (end_time - start_time)) / 1000  # Convert from seconds to kilobytes

    print(f'Save speed: {save_speed} KB/s')
    ```
    This script measures the save speed of numpy's `np.save` function. The `np.save` function saves a numpy array to a file, and the time it takes to save the data is measured. The save speed is calculated by dividing the size of the data (in bytes) by the time taken to save the data (in seconds).
