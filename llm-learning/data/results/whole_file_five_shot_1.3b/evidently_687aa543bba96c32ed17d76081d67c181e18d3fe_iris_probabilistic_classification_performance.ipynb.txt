    The code you provided is a refactoring of a column mapping in a machine learning model. The original code was creating a column mapping for a classification problem, but in your refactoring, you're creating a column mapping for a regression problem.

    Here's a refactoring of the column mapping for a regression problem:

```python
iris_column_mapping = {}

iris_column_mapping['target'] = 'target'
iris_column_mapping['numerical_features'] = iris.feature_names
```

In this refactoring, the 'target' column is mapped to the target variable, and the numerical features are mapped to their original names. This is a common practice in regression problems.

Please note that the column mapping for regression problems is not as straightforward as for classification problems. The target variable is continuous, and the numerical features are categorical. Therefore, you might need to adjust the column mapping according to your specific use case.
