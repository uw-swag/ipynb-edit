    The commit message "Upgrade to djl 0.13.0 (#176)" is updating the code to use the latest version of the Deep Java Library (djl) which is version 0.13.0. 

    The code includes the following changes:

    1. The SequentialBlock class has been replaced with the MLPBlock class from the ai.djl.nn package.
    2. The Linear class has been replaced with the LinearBlock class from the ai.djl.nn package.
    3. The Accuracy class has been replaced with the AccuracyEvaluator class from the ai.djl.metric package.
    4. The FashionMnist class has been replaced with the CIFAR10 class from the ai.djl.basicdataset.cv.classification package.
    5. The SequentialBlock.add() method has been replaced with the MLPBlock.add() method.
    6. The SequentialBlock.setInitializer() method has been replaced with the MLPBlock.setInitializer() method.
    7. The Tracker class has been replaced with the FixedTracker class from the ai.djl.training.optimizer package.
    8. The Optimizer.sgd() method has been replaced with the Optimizer.sgd(LearningRate.fixed(0.5f)) method.
    9. The Loss.softmaxCrossEntropyLoss() method has been replaced with the Loss.softmaxCrossEntropyLoss(0.5f) method.
    10. The DefaultTrainingConfig.addEvaluator() method has been replaced with the DefaultTrainingConfig.addEvaluator(new Accuracy()) method.
    11. The Model.newInstance() method has been replaced with the Model.newInstance("mlp") method.
    12. The Trainer.getMetrics() method has been replaced with the Trainer.getEvaluators().stream().forEach() method.
    13. The Metrics.getMetric() method has been replaced with the Metrics.getMetric("train_epoch_" + evaluator.getName()).stream().mapToDouble(x -> x.getValue().doubleValue
