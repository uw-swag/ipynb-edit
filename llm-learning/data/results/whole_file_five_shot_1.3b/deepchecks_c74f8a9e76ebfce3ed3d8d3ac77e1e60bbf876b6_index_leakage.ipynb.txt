    The commit message "changed all checks to pass class to checkresult (#109)" is a change that has been made to the code to ensure that all checks are passing and the class is correctly passed to the check result. This is a good practice as it makes the code more robust and easier to understand.

    The changes made in the code are as follows:

    1. The function `dataset_from_dict` is now accepting a second argument `index_name` which is used to set the index of the DataFrame.
    2. The `IndexTrainValidationLeakage` class is now a class method, which means it can be called directly on a class, not an instance of the class.
    3. The `run` method of the `IndexTrainValidationLeakage` class is now a class method, which means it can be called directly on a class, not an instance of the class.

    The commit message is updated to reflect these changes.
