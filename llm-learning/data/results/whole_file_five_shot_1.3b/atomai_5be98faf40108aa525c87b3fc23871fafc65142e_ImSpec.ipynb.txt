    The installation instructions for the libraries used in the code are as follows:

    1. `atomai`: This library is used for the implementation of the ImSpec model, which is a deep learning model for converting image data into spectral data.

    2. `numpy`: This library is used for numerical computations.

    3. `matplotlib`: This library is used for plotting.

    4. `wget`: This is a command-line utility for downloading files from the internet.

    The code also uses the `im2spec.zip` file from the Dropbox link, which is a dataset used for the ImSpec model.

    The code also uses the `eels_imspec.npz` file from the Dropbox link, which is a dataset used for the ImSpec model.

    The code also uses the `specval`, `im2spec_images`, `im2spec_spectra`, and `im2spec_specval` variables from the `imspec_data.npz` file.

    The code also uses the `specval`, `imgs`, `spectra`, and `specval` variables from the `eels_imspec.npz` file.

    The code also uses the `imgs_train`, `spectra_train`, `imgs_test`, `spectra_test` variables from the `data_split` function.

    The code also uses the `in_dim`, `out_dim`, `latent_dim`, and `seed` variables from the `ImSpec` model.

    The code also uses the `k` variable for indexing the `imgs`, `spectra`, `specval`, `imgs_train`, `spectra_train`, `imgs_test`, `spectra_test`, and `prediction` arrays.

    The code also uses the `imshow`, `plot`, `imgs`, `spectra`, `specval`, `imgs_train`, `spectra_train`, `imgs_test`, `spectra_test`, and `prediction` functions from the `matplotlib.pyplot` and `nump
