    The code provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification. The notebook starts with installing the necessary libraries and importing the necessary modules. It then reads a CSV file containing cell samples data and plots the scatter plot of 'Clump' and 'UnifSize' features.

    The SVM model is trained on the training data and then used to predict the class of the test data. The accuracy of the model is then evaluated using the confusion matrix and classification report.

    The notebook also includes a function to plot the confusion matrix, which is a useful tool for understanding the performance of a classification model.

    Finally, the notebook demonstrates how to compute the F1-score and the Jaccard score of the model, which are two commonly used metrics for evaluating the performance of a classification model.

    The notebook also demonstrates how to train a new SVM model on the same data and use it to make predictions.

    The notebook ends with the computation of the F1-score and the Jaccard score of the new model, and the comparison of these scores with the scores of the original model.
