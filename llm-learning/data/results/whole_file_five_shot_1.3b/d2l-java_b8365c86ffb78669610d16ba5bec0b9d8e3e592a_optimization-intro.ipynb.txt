    However, the version you're referring to is not available in the Maven repository. The latest version of mxnet-native is 1.7.0, but the version you're trying to use is 1.7.0-a, which is a snapshot version.

    If you want to use the latest version of mxnet-native, you can use the following command:

    ```
    %maven ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-native:1.7.0
