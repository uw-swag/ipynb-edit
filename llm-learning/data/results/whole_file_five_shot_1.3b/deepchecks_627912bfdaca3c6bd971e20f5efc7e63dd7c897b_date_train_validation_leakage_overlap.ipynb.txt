    ## Refactoring Notebook Folder Structure

    The notebook folder structure can be refactored to improve readability and maintainability. Here are the changes:

    1. **Rename the 'Data' folder to 'Data_Processing'**: This change is to reflect the new location of the data processing related files.
    
    2. **Rename the 'Scripts' folder to 'Scripts_Processing'**: This change is to reflect the new location of the scripting related files.
    
    3. **Rename the 'Images' folder to 'Images_Processing'**: This change is to reflect the new location of the image related files.
    
    4. **Rename the 'Output' folder to 'Output_Processing'**: This change is to reflect the new location of the output related files.
    
    5. **Rename the 'Templates' folder to 'Templates_Processing'**: This change is to reflect the new location of the template related files.
    
    The refactored folder structure will make it easier for other developers to understand the structure of the notebook.
