    The code you provided is a Maven project that uses the DJL library for machine learning. The project is set up to use the latest version of the DJL library. The project also uses the latest version of the SLF4J library for logging, and the MXNet library for machine learning.

    The project also uses the Tablesaw library for data manipulation and visualization. The project also uses the Apache Commons Lang library for utility functions.

    The project has a main function that trains a machine learning model using the DJL library. The model is a simple linear regression model, and the training process is done using stochastic gradient descent. The learning rate is set to 0.003. The model is also regularized with a weight decay factor of 0.03.

    The project also has a function for training the model with a weight decay factor. This function is used to train the model with a weight decay factor of 0.03.

    The project also has a function for training the model with a fixed learning rate. This function is used to train the model with a fixed learning rate of 0.01.

    The project has a main function that trains the model with a fixed learning rate. This function is used to train the model with a fixed learning rate of 0.01.

    The project has a function for training the model with a weight decay factor. This function is used to train the model with a weight decay factor of 0.03.

    The project has a function for training the model with a fixed learning rate. This function is used to train the model with a fixed learning rate of 0.01.
