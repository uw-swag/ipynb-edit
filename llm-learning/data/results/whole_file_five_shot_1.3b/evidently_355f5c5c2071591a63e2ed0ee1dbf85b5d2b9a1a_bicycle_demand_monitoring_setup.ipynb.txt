    The code you've provided is a complete example of a machine learning pipeline using scikit-learn, pandas, and mlflow. It includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation. The pipeline is also visualized using the evidently library.

    However, the code you've provided is quite long and complex, and it seems to be missing some parts. For example, the code for loading the data, preprocessing the data, and splitting the data into training and testing sets is missing. Also, the code for calculating the metrics and logging them to MLflow is missing.

    If you need help with a specific part of this code, please provide more details.
