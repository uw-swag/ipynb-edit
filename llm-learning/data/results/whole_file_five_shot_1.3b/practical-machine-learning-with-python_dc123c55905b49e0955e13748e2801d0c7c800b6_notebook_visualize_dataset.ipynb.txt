    The commit message "removing useless git LFS" is not clear. It seems like the author is trying to remove the Git Large File Storage (LFS) from the project. However, without more context, it's hard to provide a more specific answer. 

    If you're referring to the Git LFS setup, it's a tool by GitHub that allows the storage of large files (like images, videos, etc.) in a repository. The LFS is a part of Git LFS's core features, and it's not something that can be removed from the project.

    If you're referring to the removal of a specific library or package, please provide more context.
