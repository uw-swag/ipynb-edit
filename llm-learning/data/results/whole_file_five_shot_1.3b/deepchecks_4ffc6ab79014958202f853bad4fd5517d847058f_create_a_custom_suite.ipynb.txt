    The code you provided is a demonstration of how to create a custom suite of checks for a machine learning model. The suite includes checks for model performance, feature importance, and data leakage.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The first part imports necessary libraries and sets up the environment.
    - The second part loads the iris dataset and splits it into a training set and a test set.
    - The third part creates a RandomForestClassifier and trains it on the training set.
    - The fourth part creates a Dataset for the training and test sets.
    - The fifth part runs the custom suite on the trained model.
    - The sixth part creates a new suite with a condition that removes unused features.
    - The seventh part modifies the suite by removing a condition.
    - The eighth part adds a new check with a condition to the suite.
    - The ninth part removes all conditions for a check and updates the suite's name.
    - The tenth part runs the modified suite on the training and test sets.

    The final part of the code demonstrates how to use the `train_test_leakage` suite, which is a custom suite that includes checks for data leakage.

    Please note that the code is a demonstration and may not work as expected if run without modifications.
