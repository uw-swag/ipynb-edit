    The code you provided is a collection of functions that are used to preprocess and analyze EEG data. The functions include:

    1. `readEdfFile`: This function reads the EDF file and returns the signal data.
    2. `get_seizure_period`: This function reads the seizure file and returns the start time and length of the seizure.
    3. `read_and_store_data`: This function reads the EEG data from the specified dataset and returns a pandas DataFrame.
    4. `leftRightHemisphericChannels`: This function separates the left and right hemispheric channels from the DataFrame.
    5. `ComputeTimeDomainFeatures`: This function computes time domain features of the EEG signal.
    6. `psd`: This function computes the power spectral density of the EEG signal.
    7. `ComputeCorrelation`: This function computes the correlation between the left and right hemispheric channels.
    8. `featureExtraction`: This function extracts the features from the EEG data.
    9. `featureNormalization`: This function normalizes the features.
    10. `dimentionalityReduction`: This function reduces the dimensionality of the features.
    11. `oversamplingSMOTE`: This function oversamples the minority class using SMOTE.
    12. `metrics`: This function computes the metrics for the classification problem.

    The code also includes the following cells:

    1. `sample_rate`: The sample rate of the EEG data.
    2. `time_window`: The time window for the feature extraction.
    3. `pca_tolerance`: The tolerance for the PCA reduction.
    4. `dataset`: The name of the dataset.
    5. `smote_neighbors`: The number of neighbors for SMOTE.
