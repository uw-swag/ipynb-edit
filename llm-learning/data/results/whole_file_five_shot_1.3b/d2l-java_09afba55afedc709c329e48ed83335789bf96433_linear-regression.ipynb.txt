    The code you've provided is a mix of Maven dependencies and Java code snippets. Here's a brief explanation of what each section does:

    1. Maven dependencies: These are the libraries that you're using in your project. The `%maven` directives are used to add Maven dependencies to your project. The `<dependency>` tag in the POM file is used to define the dependencies of your project.

    2. Java code snippets: These are the code snippets you've provided. They include import statements, class definitions, method definitions, and more. The `<Cell_3>` and `<Cell_4>` sections are Java code snippets that use the `ai.djl` and `ai.djl.ndarray` libraries.

    3. Plotting code: The `<Cell_10>` section is Java code that uses the `tech.tablesaw` and `tech.tablesaw.plotly` libraries to create a line plot. This plot shows the normal distributions of three different means and variances.

    Please note that the code snippets are written in a specific programming language (Java) and they are not runnable. They are meant to be used in a Jupyter notebook or a similar environment.
