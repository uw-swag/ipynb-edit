    This code is a set of functions for feature extraction from EEG data. The functions are designed to extract time-domain features such as mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, standard deviation, median, zero crossings, coefficient of variation, root mean square, peak to peak, and sample entropy from the EEG signals. 

    The functions also compute the average bandpower of the EEG signals and the power spectral density (PSD) of the signals. The PSD is computed using Welch's method, which is a robust method for computing the power spectral density.

    The functions also compute the correlation between the left and right hemisphere channels.

    The feature extraction is done in steps of 'step' samples. The number of samples to be processed at each step is determined by the 'step' parameter.

    The feature extraction functions return a pandas DataFrame containing the computed features for each step of the data.

    The functions are designed to work with both left and right hemisphere channels.

    The functions are also designed to work with both average and surrogate signals.

    The functions are designed to work with both time-domain features and frequency-domain features.

    The functions are designed to work with both EEG signals and surrogate signals.
