    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook, and it's using the Deep Java Library (DJL) to interact with the GPUs. The DJL version you're using is 0.13.0.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The first part of the code is importing the necessary libraries and classes.
    - The second part of the code is printing the system's GPU and CPU information.
    - The third part of the code is importing the DJL imports.
    - The fourth part of the code is printing the CPU, the first GPU, and the second GPU.
    - The fifth part of the code is creating a new NDManager and an NDArray.
    - The sixth part of the code is creating a 2x3 NDArray with a float32 data type.
    - The seventh part of the code is creating a 2x3 NDArray with random float32 values between -1 and 1.
    - The eighth part of the code is adding the second NDArray to the first and printing the result.
    - The ninth part of the code is printing the result of adding the second NDArray to the first.

    Please note that the code you provided is incomplete and may not work as expected. It's just a sample code to demonstrate how to use the DJL to interact with GPUs.

    To upgrade to DJL 0.13.0, you need to follow the official DJL documentation or the instructions provided in the commit message.
