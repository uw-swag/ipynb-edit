```python
    # Homework 7:
    #
    # Write a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list that contains only the even numbers from the original list.
    #
    # For example, if the input is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the output should be [2, 4, 6].

    def get_even_numbers(numbers):
        return [number for number in numbers if number % 2 == 0]

    # Test the function
    print(get_even_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]))  # Output: [2, 4, 6]
    ```
