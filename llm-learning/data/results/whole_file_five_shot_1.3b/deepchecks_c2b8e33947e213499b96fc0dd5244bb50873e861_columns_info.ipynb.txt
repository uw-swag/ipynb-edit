    The commit message "[Automatic] Examples Update (#619)" suggests that the examples have been updated to reflect the latest changes in the codebase.

    The original code cells are not provided, but I can provide a general explanation of what the code does.

    The code imports necessary libraries for data manipulation and visualization. It then generates a random dataset with numerical and categorical features, and a label. The dataset is then passed to a DeepChecks check, which is a library for automated validation of machine learning models.

    The check, which is a function of the `ColumnsInfo` class, is used to analyze the dataset. This function checks the number of features, their types, and the presence of missing values.

    The result of the check is a report of the analysis, which includes information about the number of features, their types, and the presence of missing values.
