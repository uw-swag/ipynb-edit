    The code you provided is for a Jupyter notebook. It includes the necessary dependencies for the project, as well as the code to load the necessary libraries and modules.

    The code also includes the creation of a SequentialBlock model, which is a basic model in deep learning. The model is a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with one hidden layer.

    The code also includes the training of the model using the training data, and the evaluation of the model's performance on the test data.

    The code also includes the creation of a Table to store the results of the training and evaluation, and the rendering of a LinePlot to visualize the training loss and accuracy over epochs.
