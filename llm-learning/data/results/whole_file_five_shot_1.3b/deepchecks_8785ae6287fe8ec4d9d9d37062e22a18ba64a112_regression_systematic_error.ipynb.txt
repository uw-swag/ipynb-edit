    The code provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook. The notebook is designed to showcase how to use the DeepChecks library to perform a systematic error check on a Gradient Boosting Regressor model. The systematic error check is a type of regression check that checks for systematic errors in the predicted values.

    The notebook first loads the diabetes dataset from sklearn, splits it into a training set and a test set, and then trains a Gradient Boosting Regressor model on the training set. The model is then run on the test set and the results are checked for systematic errors.

    The DeepChecks library is used to perform these checks. The check is a regression systematic error check, which checks for systematic errors in the predicted values.

    The notebook then prints the results of the check.

    The notebook ends with a comment indicating that the code is for demonstration purposes and may not be suitable for a production environment.
