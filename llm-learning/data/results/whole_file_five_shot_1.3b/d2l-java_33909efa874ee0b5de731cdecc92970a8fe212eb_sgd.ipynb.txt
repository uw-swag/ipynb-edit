    The commit message "CI/CD fix on jupyter (#41)" suggests that there is a change in the CI/CD pipeline. This could be related to the Jupyter notebook, which is a web-based platform for data science and data analytics.

    The code cells in the commit message are related to the following tasks:

    1. Loading necessary libraries and modules.
    2. Defining a function to get a random normal number.
    3. Implementing a simple linear regression model with gradient descent.
    4. Experimenting with different learning rates for the linear regression model.

    The commit message also mentions the use of a CI/CD pipeline, which is a process that automates the software development process, allowing developers to integrate code changes into a shared repository frequently. This can help to ensure that the code is always in a stable and reliable state.

    However, the provided code is not related to any specific task or commit message. It's a set of commands that are used to load libraries, define functions, and perform some operations on Jupyter notebook. If you have any specific questions or need help with a specific part of the code, feel free to ask!
