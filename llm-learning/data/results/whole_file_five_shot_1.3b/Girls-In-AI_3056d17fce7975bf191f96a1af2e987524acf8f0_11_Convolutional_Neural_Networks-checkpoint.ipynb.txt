    The code you've provided is a complete Jupyter notebook that includes the entire process of training a model to classify surnames based on their nationality. 

    The notebook starts by importing necessary libraries and defining some global parameters. It then loads a dataset, makes a vectorizer, and creates a model. 

    The model is then trained, validated, and tested. The performance of the model is then plotted. Finally, the trained model is saved for future use.

    The notebook also includes a class for an inference system, which can be used to classify new surnames based on the trained model.

    Please note that the code provided is a basic template and may need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of your project.
