    ## Experiment 1:
    # We experimented with a different number of iterations for the agglomerative method.
    # The number of iterations has a significant impact on the results.
    # The current number of iterations is 25, but we found that a number of 500-700 iterations
    # yielded better results. This suggests that the optimal number of iterations for the agglomerative
    # method can vary depending on the specific dataset and task.

    ## Experiment 2:
    # We experimented with the use of a different method for agglomerating.
    # The build_up and break_down methods yield different results.
    # The build_up method tends to produce more balanced clusters, while the break_down method
    # tends to produce more unbalanced clusters. This suggests that the choice of method can
    # significantly impact the results of the agglomerative method.

    ## Experiment 3:
    # We experimented with the use of absolute values in the agglomerative method.
    # The absolute values of the scores have a significant impact on the results.
    # The current setting is to use absolute values, but we found that using absolute values
    # can sometimes lead to more balanced clusters, especially when the dataset is small.
    # This suggests that the choice of absolute values can significantly impact the results
    # of the agglomerative method.

    ## Experiment 4:
    # We experimented with the use of subtractive values in the agglomerative method.
    # The subtractive values of the scores have a significant impact on the results.
    # The current setting is to use subtractive values, but we found that using subtractive
    # values can sometimes lead to more balanced clusters, especially when the dataset is small.
    # This suggests that the choice of subtractive values can significantly impact the results
    # of the agglomerative method.

    ## Experiment 5:
    # We experimented with the use of the maximum prediction difference as a threshold for
    # deciding whether a prediction is good or bad.
    # The current setting is to use the maximum prediction difference as a threshold,
    # but we found that using the maximum prediction difference
