    The commit message "Fixing CI errors. (#5)" suggests that there are some issues with the Continuous Integration (CI) environment. The error messages or issues could be related to the build process, the version of the libraries used, or other factors.

    The original code cells are not provided, so I can't provide a specific solution. However, I can suggest a few general steps to troubleshoot the CI errors:

    1. Check the build process: Ensure that the build process is correctly configured and all dependencies are correctly installed.
    2. Check the version of the libraries: Ensure that the versions of the libraries used in the build process are compatible.
    3. Check the CI environment: If possible, try running the CI environment locally to see if the issues are specific to the CI environment.
    4. If the issues are not specific to the CI environment, consider reaching out to the maintainers of the libraries or the CI provider for help.
