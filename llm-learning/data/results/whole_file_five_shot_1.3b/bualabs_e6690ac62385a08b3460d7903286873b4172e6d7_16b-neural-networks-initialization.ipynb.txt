    The Kaiming Initialization is a method used to initialize the weights in a neural network. It is a popular method used in deep learning to speed up the training process. The method involves randomly initializing the weights to small values and then adjusting them based on the gradients. This is done to prevent the vanishing gradient problem, which is a common problem in deep learning.
