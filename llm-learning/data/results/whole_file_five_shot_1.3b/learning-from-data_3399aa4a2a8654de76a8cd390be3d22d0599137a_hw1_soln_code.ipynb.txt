    # Homework 1
    # 
    # Please write a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers.
    # The function should return a list of integers that are the squares of the input list.
    # For example, if the input is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the output should be [1, 4, 9, 16, 25].

    def square_list(input_list):
        # Your code here

    # Testing the function
    print(square_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
    ```
