    The code you've provided is a mix of Jupyter notebook cells. It's not clear what the purpose of each cell is, but I'll take a look at them one by one.

1. Cell_0: This cell is importing necessary libraries for the notebook.

2. Cell_1: This cell is displaying a style for the notebook.

3. Cell_2: This cell is defining a function to load images.

4. Cell_3: This cell is reading CSV files and preparing the data for the model.

5. Cell_4: This cell is displaying the first few rows of the data.

6. Cell_5: This cell is reshaping the data and preparing it for the model.

7. Cell_6: This cell is displaying a bar plot of the labels.

8. Cell_7: This cell is loading an image and displaying it.

9. Cell_8: This cell is preparing the data for the model.

10. Cell_9: This cell is defining the model architecture for the MLP.

11. Cell_10: This cell is compiling the model and defining the callbacks.

12. Cell_11: This cell is training the model.

13. Cell_12: This cell is displaying the training history.

14. Cell_13: This cell is loading the model weights and evaluating the model on the test set.

15. Cell_14: This cell is defining the model architecture for the CNN.

16. Cell_15: This cell is compiling the model and defining the callbacks.

17. Cell_16: This cell is training the model.

18. Cell_17: This cell is displaying the training history.

19. Cell_18: This cell is loading the model weights and evaluating the model on the test set.

20. Cell_19: This cell is moving the model weights to a file.

21. Cell_20: This cell is displaying the model's performance metrics.

22. Cell_21: This cell is killing the current process.
