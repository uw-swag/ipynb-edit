    The code you provided is a Python script that uses the Evidently library to analyze the stability of data and the drift of target variables in a dataset. The script uses the DataStabilityTestPreset and NumTargetDrift metrics, and the TestSuite to run these tests.

    However, the code you provided is not complete and does not include the rework of the TargetDriftPreset. The rework of the TargetDriftPreset is not clear from the code you provided.

    If you want to rework the TargetDriftPreset, you would need to define a new class that inherits from the TargetDriftPreset class and override the necessary methods. Here is an example of how you might do this:

    ```python
    from evidently.report import Report
    from evidently.metric_preset import DataDriftPreset
    from evidently.metric_preset import NumTargetDrift
    from evidently.test_suite import TestSuite
    from evidently.test_preset import DataStabilityTestPreset
    from evidently.tests import *

    class MyTargetDriftPreset(TargetDriftPreset):
        def calculate_drift(self, reference_data: pd.DataFrame, current_data: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
            # Your custom logic to calculate the drift
            pass

    # Use your custom preset
    drift_report = Report(metrics=[MyTargetDriftPreset(), NumTargetDrift()])
    ```

    Please note that the above code is just an example and may not work as expected. You would need to replace the `calculate_drift` method with your own logic to calculate the drift.

    Also, the `TestSuite` and `TestNumberOfColumnsWithNulls`, `TestNumberOfRowsWithNulls`, `TestNumberOfConstantColumns`, `TestNumberOfDuplicatedRows`, `TestNumberOfDuplicatedColumns`, `TestColumnsType`, `TestNumberOfDriftedColumns` are not defined in the provided code. You would need to define these tests or replace them with your own.

    Finally, the `tests.run(reference_data=reference, current_data=current)` line is not complete
