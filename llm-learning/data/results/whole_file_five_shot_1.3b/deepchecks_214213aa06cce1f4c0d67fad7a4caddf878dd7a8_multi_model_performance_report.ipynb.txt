# Documentation and Readme

# ## Overview

The project is about using deep learning and machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict various types of datasets. The main goal is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of data analysis and prediction.

# ## Installation

To install the project, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install deepchecks
```

# ## Usage

Here is a basic usage of the project:

```python
from deepchecks.base import Dataset
from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier, RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from deepchecks.checks.performance import MultiModelPerformanceReport

iris = load_iris(as_frame=True)
train, test = train_test_split(iris.frame, test_size=0.33, random_state=42)

train_ds = Dataset(train, label="target")
test_ds = Dataset(test, label="target")

clf1 = AdaBoostClassifier().fit(train_ds.features_columns, train_ds.label_col)
clf2 = RandomForestClassifier().fit(train_ds.features_columns, train_ds.label_col)
clf3 = DecisionTreeClassifier().fit(train_ds.features_columns, train_ds.label_col)

MultiModelPerformanceReport().run(train_ds, test_ds, [clf1, clf2, clf3])
```
