The code you provided is a part of a larger pipeline for data analysis and visualization. Here's a brief explanation of the changes:

1. **Options for configuring pipeline components:** The code now includes options for configuring pipeline components. This includes setting the target column, numerical and categorical features, and the confidence level for the data drift detection.

2. **Verbosity settings for tabs:** The code now includes verbosity settings for the tabs in the Dashboard. This means that the Dashboard will now print out more information about the data drift and the profile.

3. **DataDriftOptions:** The code now includes an example of how to set custom bins for the DataDriftOptions. This is an option that allows you to specify custom bins for numerical features and the target column.

4. **Profile:** The code now includes an example of how to set custom bins for the Profile. This is an option that allows you to specify custom bins for numerical features and the target column.

5. **DataDriftTableWidget:** The code now includes an example of how to set custom bins for the DataDriftTableWidget. This is an option that allows you to specify custom bins for numerical features and the target column.

6. **DataDriftTab:** The code now includes an example of how to set custom bins for the DataDriftTab. This is an option that allows you to specify custom bins for numerical features and the target column.

7. **DataDriftOptions and DataDriftProfileSection:** The code now includes an example of how to set custom bins for the DataDriftOptions and the DataDriftProfileSection. This is an option that allows you to specify custom bins for numerical features and the target column.

8. **DataDriftOptions and DataDriftProfileSection:** The code now includes an example of how to set custom bins for the DataDriftOptions and the DataDriftProfileSection. This is an option that allows you to specify custom bins for numerical features and the target column.

9. **DataDriftOptions and DataDriftProfileSection:** The code now includes an example of how to set custom bins for the DataDriftOptions and the DataDriftProfileSection. This is an option that allows you to specify custom bins for numerical features and the target column.

10. **DataDriftOptions and
