    The commit message "bump of D2L Java book version to 0.8.0 (#58)" is a request to bump the version of the D2L Java book to 0.8.0. This is a general request and may not directly affect the current version of the book.

    The code cells are related to the version of the D2L Java book. They are importing the necessary libraries and classes for the book, and then creating a bounding box for a dog and a cat, and drawing these bounding boxes on the original image.

    The version number is bumped to 0.8.0 because the current version is 0.7.0-SNAPSHOT. The SNAPSHOT version is used for testing and may not be suitable for production use.
