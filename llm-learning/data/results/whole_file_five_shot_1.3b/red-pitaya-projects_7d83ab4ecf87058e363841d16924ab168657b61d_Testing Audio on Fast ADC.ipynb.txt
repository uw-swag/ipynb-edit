    ### Response:
    The code you provided is a simple example of how to use the Red Pitaya's Mercury module to record audio data from a Red Pitaya FPGA. The code includes setting up the audio input, triggering the recording, and displaying the recorded audio data.

    However, the code you provided does not include a streaming server
