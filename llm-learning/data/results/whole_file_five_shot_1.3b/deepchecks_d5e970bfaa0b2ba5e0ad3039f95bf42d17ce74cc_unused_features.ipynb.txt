    # Changing package structure

    # The original code was using the 'deepchecks' package, which is now deprecated.
    # We'll be using the 'autopep8' package to change the package structure.

    # First, we need to install the 'autopep8' package.
    # You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
    # pip install autopep8

    # After installing the 'autopep8' package, you can use the following command to change the package structure:
    # autopep8 -i -r -a -p deepchecks

    # This command will replace all occurrences of 'deepchecks' with 'autopep8' in the code.
    # The '-i' flag is for inline editing, the '-r' flag is for recursive, and the '-a' flag is for all files.
    # The '-p' flag is for the path to the package.

    # After running the command, the code will be reformatted according to the new package structure.

    # Please note that the 'autopep8' package is not a part of the standard Python library, so you need to install it separately.

    # After changing the package structure, you need to run the code again to see the changes.

    # Also, please note that the 'autopep8' package is not a perfect solution for all cases. It can sometimes produce incorrect results, especially when dealing with complex code structures.

    # In the original code, the 'deepchecks' package was used to perform various checks on the dataset.
    # However, as of now, the 'deepchecks' package is deprecated and no longer maintained.
