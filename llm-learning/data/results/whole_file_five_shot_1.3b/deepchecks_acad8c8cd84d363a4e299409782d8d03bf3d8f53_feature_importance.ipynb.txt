    The commit message "Renaming MLChecks to deepchecks (#133)" is a change in the commit message format. The commit message is a short, descriptive summary of the changes made in the commit. The commit message should be written in the imperative form, starting with a capital letter and ending with a period.

    The code cells in the commit message are the changes made in the code. They are written in a markdown-like format, with a single space between each cell. Each cell is a code snippet, and the code is written in a language-specific format.

    The code in the commit message is a Python script that uses the MLChecks library to analyze a dataset and display the feature importance. The script includes renaming the library from MLChecks to deepchecks, creating a new DataFrame with the dataset, training a RandomForestClassifier, and using the FeatureImportance check to analyze the classifier.

    The code is divided into several cells, each with a different task. The first cell loads the Iris dataset, adds a new column for the label, and creates a new DataFrame. The next cell trains a RandomForestClassifier on the DataFrame. The FeatureImportance check is then run on the classifier to analyze the feature importance. The script then moves on to create a binary dataset, trains another classifier, and uses the FeatureImportance check on the binary dataset.
