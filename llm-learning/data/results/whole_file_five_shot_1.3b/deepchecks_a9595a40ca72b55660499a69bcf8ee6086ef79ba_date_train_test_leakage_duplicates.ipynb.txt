    The commit message "fixing docs (#898)" is a fix for a documentation issue. The issue is with the DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates check in the deepchecks library. The check is designed to detect duplicates in the training dataset that are also present in the test dataset, which is not the case in the provided code.

    The fix is to remove the duplicates check from the DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates class. The duplicates check is not needed in this case, as the duplicates are not present in the test dataset.
