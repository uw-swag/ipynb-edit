    The examples have been updated to reflect the latest changes in the DeepChecks library.

    The `DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap` check has been updated to correctly handle overlapping dates in the training and testing datasets. This check will now return a warning if there are overlapping dates in the training and testing datasets.

    The `dataset_from_dict` function has been updated to correctly handle datetime columns. This function will now correctly parse datetime columns from the input data and return a `Dataset` object.
