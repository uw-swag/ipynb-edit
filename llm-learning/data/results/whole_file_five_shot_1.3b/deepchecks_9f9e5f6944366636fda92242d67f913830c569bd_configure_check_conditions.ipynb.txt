    The commit message "Adding widgets support in the docs ðŸŽ¨ (#673)" adds widgets support to the documentation. This is a major improvement as it allows for a more interactive and user-friendly experience. The widgets provide a more visually appealing way to view and understand the results of the checks.

    The widgets used in this commit include:
    - A table viewer for displaying the results of the checks
    - A plot viewer for visualizing the results of the checks
