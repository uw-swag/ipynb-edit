The code you provided is a Python script that uses the Deepchecks library to compare the sizes of a training dataset and a test dataset. The script also uses matplotlib to display a bar graph of the sizes of the two datasets.

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. The `DatasetSizeComparison` class inherits from `TrainTestBaseCheck`, which is a base class for all checks in Deepchecks.

2. The `run` method in the `DatasetSizeComparison` class implements the logic for the check. It calculates the number of samples in the training and test datasets, and returns these values as a dictionary.

3. The `result` variable holds the result of the check.

4. The `result.value` line prints the values of the check result.

5. The `DatasetSizeComparison` class also has a `display` method that creates a matplotlib graph of the sizes of the training and test datasets.

6. The `DatasetSizeComparison` class is then used to run the check on the `train_dataset` and `test_dataset` variables.

7. The `result` variable is then printed to the console.

8. The `result.display` line displays the matplotlib graph.

Please note that the code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook, and it uses a variety of Python libraries, including Deepchecks, pandas, matplotlib, and Jupyter.
