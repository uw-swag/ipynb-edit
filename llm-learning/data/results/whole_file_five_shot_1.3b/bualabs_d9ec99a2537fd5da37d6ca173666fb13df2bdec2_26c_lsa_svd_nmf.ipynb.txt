    The code you've provided is a mix of Python and Jupyter notebook cells. It's a mix of data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization tasks. 

    Here's a brief explanation of what each cell does:

    1. `<Cell_0>`: This cell is for installing the fbpca library, which is a PCA implementation that is faster than the standard scikit-learn PCA.

    2. `<Cell_1>`: This cell imports the necessary libraries and modules.

    3. `<Cell_2>`: This cell sets the print options to suppress scientific notation.

    4. `<Cell_3>`: This cell fetches the newsgroups dataset and selects the categories of interest.

    5. `<Cell_4>`: This cell prints the shape of the newsgroups training data.

    6. `<Cell_5>`: This cell prints the first 3 documents of the newsgroups training data.

    7. `<Cell_6>`: This cell prints the target of the first 3 documents.

    8. `<Cell_7>`: This cell prints the target names of the first 3 documents.

    9. `<Cell_8>`: This cell downloads the necessary NLTK packages for word tokenization and lemmatization.

    10. `<Cell_9>`: This cell defines a custom tokenizer for lemmatization.

    11. `<Cell_10>`: This cell defines a custom tokenizer for lemmatization.

    12. `<Cell_11>`: This cell defines a custom tokenizer for lemmatization.

    13. `<Cell_12>`: This cell uses the CountVectorizer for the newsgroups training data.

    14. `<Cell_13>`: This cell prints the shape of the vectors.

    15. `<Cell_14>`: This cell prints the first 10 rows of the vectors.

    16. `<Cell_15>`: This cell plots the first 10 rows of the vectors.

    17. `<Cell_16>`: This cell prints the shape of the vectors.
