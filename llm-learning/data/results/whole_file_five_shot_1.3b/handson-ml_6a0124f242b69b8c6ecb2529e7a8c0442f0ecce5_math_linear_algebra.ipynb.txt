    ## Linear Algebra

    Linear Algebra is a fundamental part of Computer Science. It provides a way to model, analyze, and solve problems involving data that is represented in a grid format, such as matrices.

    ### Basic Operations

    - Addition: Addition of two matrices is done by adding the corresponding elements of the two matrices.
    - Subtraction: Subtraction of two matrices is done by subtracting the corresponding elements of the second matrix from the first matrix.
    - Multiplication: Matrix multiplication is a process in which a matrix is multiplied by another matrix.
    - Transpose: The transpose of a matrix is a matrix where the rows and columns of the original matrix are swapped.
    - Determinant: The determinant of a matrix is a scalar value that is the product of the values on the main diagonal of the matrix.
    - Inverse: The inverse of a matrix is a matrix that when multiplied by the original matrix gives the identity matrix.

    ### Matrix Operations

    - Addition: Addition of two matrices is done by adding the corresponding elements of the two matrices.
    - Subtraction: Subtraction of two matrices is done by subtracting the corresponding elements of the second matrix from the first matrix.
    - Scalar Multiplication: Scalar multiplication of a matrix is done by multiplying each element of the matrix by a scalar.
    - Matrix Multiplication: Matrix multiplication is a process in which a matrix is multiplied by another matrix.

    ### Vector Operations

    - Addition: Addition of a vector to another vector is done by adding the corresponding elements of the two vectors.
    - Subtraction: Subtraction of a vector from another vector is done by subtracting the corresponding elements of the second vector from the first vector.
    - Scalar Multiplication: Scalar multiplication of a vector is done by multiplying each element of the vector by a scalar.

    ### Identity Matrix

    An identity matrix is a square matrix in which all the entries above the main diagonal are zero and all the entries below the main diagonal are one.

    ### Matrix Properties

    - Symmetric: A matrix is symmetric if it is equal to its own transpose.
    - Hermitian: A matrix is Hermitian if
