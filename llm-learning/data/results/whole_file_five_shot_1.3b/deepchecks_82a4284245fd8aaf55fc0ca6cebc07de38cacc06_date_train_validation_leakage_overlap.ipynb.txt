    The code you provided is a demonstration of how to use the `DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap` check in Deepchecks. This check is used to detect if there is a leakage in the training dataset compared to the test dataset.

    The first example uses a simple dataset with two columns: 'col1' (a datetime column) and 'col2' (a categorical column). The `DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap` check is run on this dataset, which will detect a leakage if there is a datetime value in the training dataset that does not exist in the test dataset.

    The second example is a bit more complex. It uses a dataset with a datetime column 'col1' and a categorical column 'col2'. The `DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap` check is run on this dataset, which will detect a leakage if there is a datetime value in the training dataset that does not exist in the test dataset.

    The leakage detection is based on the fact that the datetime values in the training dataset are not present in the test dataset.

    Please note that the `DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap` check is a part of the Deepchecks methodology, which is a set of checks that can be run on a dataset to detect potential issues.
