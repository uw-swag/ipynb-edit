    ## Session 1: Image Processing and TensorFlow

    In this session, we will learn how to process images using TensorFlow, specifically focusing on image normalization, resizing, and convolution. We will also learn how to use Gabor filters for image processing, and how to use TensorFlow operations to perform operations on the images.

    ## Objectives

    - Understand the importance of image processing in machine learning.
    - Learn how to load, resize, and crop images.
    - Learn how to use TensorFlow to perform operations on images.
    - Learn how to use Gabor filters for image processing.
    - Understand the importance of normalization in image processing.
