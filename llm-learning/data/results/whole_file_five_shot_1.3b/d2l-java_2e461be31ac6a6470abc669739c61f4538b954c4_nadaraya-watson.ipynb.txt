    This section introduces the concept of sequence-to-sequence learning, which is a type of machine learning where an input sequence is transformed into an output sequence. The main components of sequence-to-sequence learning include a sequence-to-sequence model, an encoder-decoder architecture, and a training process.

    The section also introduces the use of deep learning libraries like DJL (Deep Java Library) for implementing sequence-to-sequence learning. It also demonstrates how to use these libraries to perform sequence-to-sequence learning, such as creating a sequence-to-sequence model, training the model, and making predictions.

    Finally, the section discusses the importance of attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence learning, which is a key component of the model's ability to understand the context of the input sequence.
