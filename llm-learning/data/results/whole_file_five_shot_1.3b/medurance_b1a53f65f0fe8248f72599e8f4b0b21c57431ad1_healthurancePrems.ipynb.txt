    # Project Source Code
    # This is a simple example of a Python project structure.

    # Inside the `src` directory, you can have the following structure:

    # `src/
    # |-- main.py
    # |-- module1/
    # |   |-- __init__.py
    # |   |-- module1.py
    # |-- module2/
    # |   |-- __init__.py
    # |   |-- module2.py
    # |-- tests/
    # |   |-- __init__.py
    # |   |-- test_module1.py
    # |   |-- test_module2.py
    # |-- data/
    # |   |-- raw/
    # |   |   |-- data1.csv
    # |   |   |-- data2.csv
    # |   |-- processed/
    # |   |   |-- data1_processed.csv
    # |   |   |-- data2_processed.csv
    # |-- notebooks/
    # |   |-- notebook1.ipynb
    # |   |-- notebook2.ipynb
    # |-- docs/
    # |   |-- conf.py
    # |   |-- index.rst
    # |-- scripts/
    # |   |-- script1.py
    # |   |-- script2.py
    # |-- requirements.txt
    # ```

    # This is a simple example of a Python project structure. It includes:

    - A `main.py` file as the entry point of the application.
    - Several subdirectories for different modules, each with their own `__init__.py` file and Python files.
    - A `tests` directory for testing.
    - A `data` directory for raw and processed data.
    - A `notebooks` directory for Jupyter notebooks.
    - A `docs` directory for documentation.
    - A `scripts` directory for scripts.
    - A `requirements.txt` file for listing the project's dependencies.

    This structure is a common pattern for Python projects, and it's also the structure that's used by the PEP 8 style guide.
