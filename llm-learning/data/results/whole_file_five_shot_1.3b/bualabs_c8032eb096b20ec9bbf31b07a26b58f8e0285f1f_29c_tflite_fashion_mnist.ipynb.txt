    The code above is a complete solution to the problem. It loads the data, divides it into training, validation, and test sets, trains a model using Random Forest Regressor, compiles the model, and then saves the model in the SavedModel format. It also uses TensorFlow Lite to optimize the model for performance. The model is then saved and downloaded for use in a mobile application. The code also includes utility functions for plotting and visualizing the outputs.
