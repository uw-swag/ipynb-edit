    ### Introduction
    Feature engineering is the process of converting raw data into features that can be used for machine learning. It involves creating new features from existing ones, selecting features, and handling missing values.

    ### Data Preprocessing
    Data preprocessing is the first step in any data analysis process. It involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and converting categorical variables into numerical variables.

    ### Feature Engineering
    Feature engineering is the process of creating new features from existing ones. This can be done in a variety of ways, such as:

    1. **Binning**: This is the process of converting continuous variables into categorical variables. For example, you can create a new feature that represents the age group of a person.

    2. **One-Hot Encoding**: This is the process of converting categorical variables into a format that can be provided to machine learning algorithms.

    3. **Interaction Features**: These are features that combine the effects of two or more input features.

    4. **Polynomial Features**: This is the process of creating new features that are combinations of the existing features.

    ### Conclusion
    Feature engineering is a critical step in data preprocessing. It helps to improve the quality of the data, make the model more accurate, and improve the performance of the model.
