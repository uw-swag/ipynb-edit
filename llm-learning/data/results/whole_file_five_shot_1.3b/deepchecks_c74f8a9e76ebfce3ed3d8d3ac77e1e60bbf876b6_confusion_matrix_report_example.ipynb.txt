    ### Response:
    The code you provided is correct and should work as expected. The `ConfusionMatrixReport` check is used to evaluate the performance of a classifier. The `run` method of the `ConfusionMatrixReport` class is used to execute the check on a given dataset.

    The `run` method takes two arguments:
    - `ds`: A `Dataset` object, which contains the test data and the labels.
    - `clf`: The classifier to be evaluated.

    The `run` method returns a `CheckResult` object, which contains the results of the check. You can use this object to get the results of the check, such as the confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
