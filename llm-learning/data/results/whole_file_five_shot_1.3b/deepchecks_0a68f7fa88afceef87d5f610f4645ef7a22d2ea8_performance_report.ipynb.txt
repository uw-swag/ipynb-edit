    The performance report notebook is designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of the model's performance on the MNIST dataset. It includes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, it also provides a visualization of the model's predictions on the test set.

    The performance report is generated using the DeepChecks library, which is a Python library for data analysis and visualization. It provides a wide range of functionalities for model performance analysis, including metrics calculation, visualization, and more.

    The performance report is run on the MNIST dataset, which is a popular dataset for image classification tasks. The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, and a visualization of the model's predictions is also provided.

    The performance report is then saved as an HTML file, which can be viewed in a web browser to see the results of the model's performance.

    The performance report is designed to be run on a machine with a GPU, as it uses PyTorch's capabilities for GPU acceleration.

    The performance report is also designed to be run on a machine with a CPU, as it uses PyTorch's capabilities for CPU acceleration.

    The performance report is also designed to be run on a machine with a specific version of Python, as it uses Python's capabilities for model performance analysis.
