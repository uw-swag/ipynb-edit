    The code you've provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses TensorFlow to train a character-level LSTM model on a text dataset. The notebook includes a number of cells that are used to perform various tasks such as data loading, model building, training, and testing.

    The code also includes a number of cells that are used to update the TensorFlow API to use the TensorFlow 1.0 API. This is done by changing the import statements at the top of the notebook to use the new API.

    The notebook also includes a number of cells that are used to perform various tasks such as data preprocessing, model evaluation, and model testing.

    The final cell at the end of the notebook is used to create a submission file for the notebook. The submission file is a zip file that includes the notebook itself, as well as a gif file and some other files.
