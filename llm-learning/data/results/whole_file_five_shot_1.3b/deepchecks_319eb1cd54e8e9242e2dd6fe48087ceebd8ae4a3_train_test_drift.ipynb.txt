    The code has been transformed from using the Dataset methods without arguments to using properties. This is a change to improve code readability and maintainability.

    The code was previously using the Dataset methods without arguments, which is not recommended. The properties are now being used instead, which is a more Pythonic way to handle this kind of data manipulation.
