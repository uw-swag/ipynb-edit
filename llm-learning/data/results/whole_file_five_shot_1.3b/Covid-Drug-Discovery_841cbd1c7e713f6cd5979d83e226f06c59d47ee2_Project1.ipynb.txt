```python
    # This is a simple Python script that uses the datetime module to create a folder named 'Days' and a subfolder for each day of the week.

    import os
    import datetime

    # Get the current date
    current_date = datetime.datetime.now()

    # Create the 'Days' folder
    if not os.path.exists('Days'):
        os.makedirs('Days')

    # Create a subfolder for each day of the week
    for i in range(7):
        day_name = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday'][i]
        day_folder = os.path.join('Days', day_name)
        if not os.path.exists(day_folder):
            os.makedirs(day_folder)

    print(f"Folder 'Days' created with subfolders for each day of the week.")
    ```

    This script will create a 'Days' folder in the current directory. It will then create a subfolder for each day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) within the 'Days' folder.

    Please note that this script will not create a subfolder for the current day. If you want to create a subfolder for the current day, you can modify the script as follows:

    ```python
    # Get the current day of the week
    current_day = datetime.datetime.today().weekday()

    # Create a subfolder for the current day
    day_folder = os.path.join('Days', day_name[current_day])
    if not os.path.exists(day_folder):
        os.makedirs(day_folder)
    ```

    This script will create a subfolder for the current day of the week within the 'Days' folder.
