    ## DeepChecks: A Deep Learning Framework for Tabular Data

    ## Overview
    DeepChecks is a Python library that provides a unified interface to perform a wide range of checks on tabular data. It is built on top of the popular deep learning library, TensorFlow, and provides a high-level interface to perform a variety of checks on tabular data.

    ## Installation
    You can install DeepChecks using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install deepchecks
    ```

    ## Usage
    Here is a basic example of how to use DeepChecks to perform a check on a tabular dataset:

    ```python
    from deepchecks.tabular.base import Dataset
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from deepchecks.tabular.checks.performance import RocReport
    import pandas as pd
    import warnings

    def custom_formatwarning(msg, *args, **kwargs):
        # ignore everything except the message
        return str(msg) + '\n'

    warnings.formatwarning = custom_formatwarning

    iris = load_iris(as_frame=True)
    clf = LogisticRegression(penalty='none')
    frame = iris.frame
    X = iris.data
    y = iris.target
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=55)
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    ds = Dataset(pd.concat([X_test, y_test], axis=1), 
                features=iris.feature_names,
                label='target')

    check = RocReport()
    check.run(ds, clf)
    ```
