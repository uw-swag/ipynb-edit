    The code provided is a demonstration of how to use the `evidently` library to perform data drift analysis and visualize the results. The library is used to measure the difference between two datasets, and to visualize the results.

    The code includes:

    - Importing necessary libraries.
    - Fetching the California housing dataset.
    - Defining the target and prediction variables.
    - Creating a `ColumnMapping` object to map the target and prediction columns.
    - Creating a reference and production data sample.
    - Creating a `Dashboard` object to visualize the data drift analysis.
    - Defining a custom function to perform the Anderson statistic test.
    - Creating an `Options` object to configure the data drift analysis.
    - Calculating the data drift analysis and visualizing the results.
    - Creating a `Profile` object to measure the data drift in the dataset.
    - Converting the profile to a JSON format.

    The code demonstrates how to perform data drift analysis, how to visualize the results, and how to measure the data drift in the dataset.
