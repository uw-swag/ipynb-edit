    ## 1. Introduction

    This notebook provides an introduction to optimization and deep learning.

    ## 2. Optimization

    Optimization is the process of finding the best solution to a problem. It involves techniques such as gradient descent, where the model's parameters are adjusted to minimize a loss function.

    ## 3. Deep Learning

    Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves the use of neural networks with many layers. These networks are trained using large amounts of data and are capable of learning complex patterns.

    ## 4. Conclusion

    In this notebook, we have covered the basics of optimization and deep learning. We have also demonstrated how to use these techniques to solve complex problems.

    ## 6. Code

    ```python
    # Import necessary libraries
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

    # Load iris dataset
    iris = load_iris()
    X = iris.data
    y = iris.target

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Create a neural network classifier
    clf = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(10, 10, 10), max_iter=1000)

    # Train the classifier
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

    # Calculate the accuracy of the
