    The notebook folder structure can be refactored to improve readability and maintainability. Here's a suggested refactoring:

    1. Create a `data_preprocessing` folder to hold all the data preprocessing code.
    2. Create a `feature_engineering` folder to hold all the feature engineering code.
    3. Create a `model_training` folder to hold all the model training code.
    4. Create a `model_evaluation` folder to hold all the model evaluation code.
    5. Create a `model_deployment` folder to hold all the model deployment code.

    This structure will make it easier to navigate and understand the different parts of the code.

    Here's the refactored code:

    ```python
    # data_preprocessing folder
    - adult.py
    - adult_data.py
    - adult_test.py

    # feature_engineering folder
    - feature_engineering.py

    # model_training folder
    - model_training.py

    # model_evaluation folder
    - model_evaluation.py

    # model_deployment folder
    - model_deployment.py
    ```

    Each file should contain the relevant code for that section of the notebook. For example, `adult.py` would contain the code for loading and preprocessing the adult dataset, `feature_engineering.py` would contain the code for feature engineering, and so on.
