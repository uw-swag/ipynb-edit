    The commit message "#672" is related to a regexp descriptor. A regexp descriptor is a type of descriptor that uses regular expressions to extract data from a column of a dataset. The descriptor is used to create a new column in the dataset that contains the results of a regular expression match.

    The original code cells are not provided, but I can see that they are using a few different types of descriptors, such as TextLength, TriggerWordsPresence, OOV, NonLetterCharacterPercentage, SentenceCount, WordCount, Sentiment. These descriptors are used to extract specific information from the 'Review_Text' column of the dataset.

    The commit message "#672" is a bit vague, but it seems to be related to a regular expression descriptor. The descriptor is used to extract certain information from the 'Review_Text' column, and the information is then used to create new columns in the dataset.

    However, the code cells provided do not seem to contain any regular expression descriptors. The descriptors used in the code are not related to the regular expression descriptors.

    The regular expression descriptors used in the code are:
    - TextLength: Extracts the length of the 'Review_Text' column.
    - SentenceCount: Extracts the number of sentences in the 'Review_Text' column.
    - WordCount: Extracts the number of words in the 'Review_Text' column.
    - Sentiment: Extracts the sentiment score of the 'Review_Text' column.

    The regular expression descriptors are not used in the code.
