```
    This Jupyter notebook is designed to demonstrate the use of the Google Cloud AutoML Operations (AutoMLOps) library in Python. AutoMLOps is a service that enables you to build, train, and deploy machine learning models on Google Cloud.

    The notebook includes the following sections:

    1. **Copyright and License Information**: This section provides copyright and license information for the notebook.

    2. **Setting up Git and Pip**: This section sets up Git and pip for use in the notebook.

    3. **Installing Google Cloud AutoML Operations**: This section installs the Google Cloud AutoML Operations library.

    4. **Setting up GCP Project**: This section sets up the GCP project for use in the notebook.

    5. **Creating a Dataset**: This section defines a custom component that loads the sklearn Iris dataset and writes it to GCS.

    6. **Fitting KMeans Clusters**: This section defines a custom component that determines KMeans clusters.

    7. **Creating a Pipeline**: This section defines a pipeline that uses the custom components to create a dataset and fit KMeans clusters.

    8. **Pipeline Parameters**: This section sets up the pipeline parameters.

    9. **Training the Pipeline**: This section trains the pipeline using the pipeline parameters.

    10. **Deploying the Model**: This section deploys the trained model.

    The notebook also includes comments to explain the code.

    Please note that the code in this notebook is for demonstration purposes only. The actual implementation may vary depending on the specific requirements of your project.
