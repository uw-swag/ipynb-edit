The code you provided is a part of a larger process that involves loading the iris dataset, splitting it into a training set and a test set, and then using a check to see if the dominant frequency of a column in the test set changes significantly.

The `DominantFrequencyChange` check is a custom check that checks if the dominant frequency of a column in a dataset significantly changes. If the dominant frequency of a column in the test set significantly changes, the check will mark the test set as inconsistent.

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. The iris dataset is loaded and split into a training set and a test set.
2. A new dataset, `validation_dataset`, is created by concatenating the test set with the target variable.
3. A check is created and run on the `validation_dataset`, using the `DominantFrequencyChange` check.

The `DominantFrequencyChange` check is a custom check that checks if the dominant frequency of a column in a dataset significantly changes. If the dominant frequency of a column in the test set significantly changes, the check will mark the test set as inconsistent.

The check is used to ensure that the test set is representative of the data that the model will be tested on. If the test set is inconsistent, it means that the model is not learning from the test set, which could lead to overfitting.
