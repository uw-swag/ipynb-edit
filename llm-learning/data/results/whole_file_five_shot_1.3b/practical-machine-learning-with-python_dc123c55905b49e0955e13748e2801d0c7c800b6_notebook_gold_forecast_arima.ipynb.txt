The commit message "removing useless git LFS" is a suggestion to remove the large file (LFS) from the repository. However, it's not clear what the actual purpose of the LFS is. It's not a file, it's a tool by Atlassian for handling large files. If you're using Git LFS, you should remove it from your repository.

Here's the code for the commit:

```
git lfs uninstall
```

This command will remove the Git LFS tracking information from your repository.
