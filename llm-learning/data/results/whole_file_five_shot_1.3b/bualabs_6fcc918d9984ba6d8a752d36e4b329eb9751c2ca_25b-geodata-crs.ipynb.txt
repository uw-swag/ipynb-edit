    The code you've provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the Kaggle API to download a dataset, then uses geopandas to manipulate and visualize the data. The code is incomplete and doesn't seem to have any issues. However, it's important to note that the code is not running as expected because the data is not being read correctly.

    The code is also not filling the `end_df` DataFrame to all birds in the dataset. This would require additional data processing and possibly a loop to iterate over all unique bird IDs in the dataset.

    The code is also not filling the `end_df` DataFrame to all birds in under half. This would require additional data processing to filter the birds to under half.
