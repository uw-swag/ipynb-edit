    The code you provided is a set of Jupyter notebooks that use the sklearn, pandas, numpy, and evidently libraries to perform various data analysis and machine learning tasks. 

    The notebooks start by importing necessary libraries and datasets. Then, they perform data quality and integrity checks on the adult dataset, which includes information about individuals in the US. The notebooks also perform data quality and integrity checks on the breast cancer dataset, which is a binary classification dataset. The notebooks also perform data quality and integrity checks on the housing dataset, which includes information about housing prices in California.

    The notebooks then use the evidently library to generate reports on the data. The reports include dataset-level and column-level metrics, as well as dataset-level and column-level metrics for the adult and breast cancer datasets. The notebooks also generate reports for binary classification and probabilistic binary classification tasks.

    The notebooks also use the sklearn library to perform various machine learning tasks, such as data quality checks, data integrity checks, and classification and regression tasks.
