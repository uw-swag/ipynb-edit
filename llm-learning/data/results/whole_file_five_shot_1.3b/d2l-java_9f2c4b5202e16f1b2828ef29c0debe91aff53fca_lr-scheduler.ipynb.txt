    The code you provided is for updating the chapter 11 optimization in a Jupyter notebook. The code is written in Python and uses the Jupyter notebook's magic commands to load and display the code.

    The code is divided into several cells, each cell containing a specific task or operation. The code is divided into sections for loading necessary libraries, defining functions, creating a model, training the model, and plotting the learning rate.

    The code is also divided into sections for creating a custom learning rate scheduler, implementing a cosine warmup scheduler, and implementing a custom tracker.

    The code is also divided into sections for loading the FashionMnist dataset, preprocessing the data, defining the model architecture, training the model, and evaluating the model.

    The code is also divided into sections for plotting the learning rate and the model's performance.
