    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that includes a number of examples related to machine learning and data analysis. Here are some of the examples:

    1. Loading and preprocessing data: This example demonstrates how to load a dataset from a URL, preprocess it, and split it into a training set and a validation set.

    2. Creating a pipeline: This example demonstrates how to create a pipeline for data preprocessing and model training.

    3. Using deepchecks: This example demonstrates how to use deepchecks, a library for exploratory data analysis, to analyze a dataset.

    4. Running a performance check: This example demonstrates how to run a performance check on a model to evaluate its performance.

    Please note that the actual execution of these examples would require a running Jupyter notebook server.
