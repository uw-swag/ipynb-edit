    ## Scraper module

    This module is used to scrape data from various sources. It currently supports the following sources:

    1. The Premier League (English Premier League) statistics from the [EA Sports](https://www.ea.com/sports/football/league-standings) website.

    2. The English Football League (EFL) statistics from the [EA Sports](https://www.ea.com/sports/football/league-standings) website.

    3. The Bundesliga statistics from the [EA Sports](https://www.ea.com/sports/football/league-standings) website.

    4. The Serie A statistics from the [EA Sports](https://www.ea.com/sports/football/league-standings) website.

    The data is scraped into a pandas DataFrame and then saved to a CSV file for future use.

    Please note that this module is not complete and may not work for all websites due to the dynamic nature of web scraping.

    The scraper module is designed to be modular and can be easily extended to support additional sources.

    The scraper module uses the BeautifulSoup and requests libraries for web scraping.

    The data is scraped from the website using the `get_data` function. The function takes a URL as input and returns a pandas DataFrame with the scraped data.

    The data is then saved to a CSV file using the `save_data` function. The function takes a pandas DataFrame and a filename as input and saves the data to a CSV file.

    The scraper module is designed to be used in a Jupyter notebook, and it can be included in a Jupyter notebook cell to scrape data.
