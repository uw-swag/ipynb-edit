    ## Adding a new notebook about filter methods
    ## This notebook will cover the basics of how to use filter methods in Python

    ## Importing necessary libraries
    from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

    ## Creating a sample dataset
    data = ['The quick brown fox', 'jumps over the lazy dog', 'Python is a great language']

    ## Creating a CountVectorizer object
    vectorizer = CountVectorizer()

    ## Transforming the data
    X = vectorizer.fit_transform(data)

    ## Printing the vocabulary
    print(vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())

    ## Printing the transformed data
    print(X.toarray())
    ```
