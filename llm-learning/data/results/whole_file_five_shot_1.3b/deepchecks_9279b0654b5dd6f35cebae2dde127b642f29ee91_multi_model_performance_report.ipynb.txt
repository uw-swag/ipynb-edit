    The code you provided is a mix of Python code and Jupyter notebook cells. It uses the Deepchecks library to analyze a dataset, and then applies different machine learning models to it. The models are AdaBoost, RandomForest, and DecisionTree. The performance of these models is then compared using a MultiModelPerformanceReport.

    The code also includes examples of using the Deepchecks library to analyze a dataset, and then applying different machine learning models to it. The models are AdaBoost, RandomForest, and DecisionTree. The performance of these models is then compared using a MultiModelPerformanceReport.
