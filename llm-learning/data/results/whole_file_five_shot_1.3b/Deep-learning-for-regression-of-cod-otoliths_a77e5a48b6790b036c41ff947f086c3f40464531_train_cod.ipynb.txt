    The code you've provided is a Python script that uses the TensorFlow and Keras libraries to train a model for image classification. The script reads images from a directory, preprocesses them, and then trains a model to classify the images.

    The script also includes a function to refactor the Python code and improve its readability.

    However, the code you've provided is quite long and complex, and it seems to be missing some parts. For example, the function `read_jpg_cods` is not defined, and the variables `train_rb_imgs`, `train_age`, `val_rb_imgs`, `val_age`, `test_rb_imgs`, `test_age` are not defined.

    Also, the code seems to be missing some parts, such as the definition of the function `get_checkpoint_tensorboard`, the definition of the function `train_validate_test_split`, and the definition of the function `base_output`.

    Please provide more details or the missing parts of the code so that I can help you refactor it.
