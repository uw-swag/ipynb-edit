```python
    # Import necessary libraries
    from google.cloud import bigquery
    from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials

    # Set up the BigQuery client
    credentials = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()
    client = bigquery.Client(credentials=credentials)

    # Define the query
    QUERY = (
        "SELECT "
        "  COUNT(*) AS num_reviews, "
        "  AVG(stars) AS avg_stars, "
        "  AVG(price) AS avg_price "
        "FROM "
        "  `project.dataset.table` "
        "WHERE "
        "  review_score > 4 "
        "AND "
        "  review_score_rank <= 10 "
        "AND "
        "  review_score_rank > 0 "
    )

    # Run the query
    query_job = client.query(QUERY)
    results = query_job.result()

    # Print the results
    for row in results:
        print("num_reviews: ", row.num_reviews)
        print("avg_stars: ", row.avg_stars)
        print("avg_price: ", row.avg_price)
    ```

    This Python script uses the Google Cloud BigQuery library to run a BigQuery ML query. The query is set to select the number of reviews, the average star rating, and the average price for reviews with a score greater than 4, a score rank less than or equal to 10, and a score rank greater than 0. The results are then printed to the console.

    Please replace `project.dataset.table` with your actual project ID, dataset ID, and table name.

    Also, make sure you have the necessary permissions to run the query and access the BigQuery dataset.
