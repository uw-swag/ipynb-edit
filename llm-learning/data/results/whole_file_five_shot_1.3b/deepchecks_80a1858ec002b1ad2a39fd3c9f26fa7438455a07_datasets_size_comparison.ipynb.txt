    The commit message "Add model comparison (#273)" suggests that the model is being compared to see if it's performing better or not.
    The code cells are not provided, but I can see that they are trying to compare the size of the training and testing datasets, and check if the ratio of the size of the test to the size of the training is not smaller than 0.2.
