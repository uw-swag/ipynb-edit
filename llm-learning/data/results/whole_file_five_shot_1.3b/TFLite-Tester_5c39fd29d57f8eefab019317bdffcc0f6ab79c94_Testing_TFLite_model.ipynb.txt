    The code you've provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses TensorFlow 2.0 and NLTK to perform basic text analytics on a dataset of flower images. The notebook includes sections for installing TensorFlow, loading and pre-processing data, training a model, evaluating the model, and exporting the model for use in a TensorFlow Lite model.

    However, the code you've provided is quite long and complex, and it's not clear what the purpose of the notebook is. It seems to be a demonstration of how to use TensorFlow 2.0 and NLTK for text analytics on a dataset of flower images.

    If you have a specific question or need help with a specific part of the notebook, feel free to ask!
