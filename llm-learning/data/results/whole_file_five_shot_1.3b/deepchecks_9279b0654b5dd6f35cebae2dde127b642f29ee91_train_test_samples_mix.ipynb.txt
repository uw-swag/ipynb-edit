    The commit message "[Automatic] Examples Update (#411)" suggests that the examples have been updated to reflect the changes made in the code.

    The original code cells are not provided, but based on the provided context, it seems like the examples have been updated to reflect the changes made in the code.

    The example provided is a DeepChecks check, which is a tool for visualizing and comparing different machine learning models. The check is run on a test dataset and a train dataset, and the results are displayed.

    The example also includes a train-test split of the Iris dataset, which is a common dataset for machine learning tasks. The train-test split is used to train and test the model, and the results are displayed.

    The example also includes a DataFrame that is used to create a new test dataset. This DataFrame is created by appending a few rows from the original test dataset to the train dataset. This is a common technique in machine learning to create a validation set.
