```python
    # Initial workspace files
    # This is a placeholder for your initial workspace files.
    # You can add your own files, libraries, or code snippets here.

    # For example, if you have a CUDA-accelerated function in a file named `cuda_functions.cu`, you can include it like this:

    # Include CUDA functions
    #%cd /path/to/your/workspace
    #%run -m cuda_functions

    # You can also use CUDA-accelerated code in a Jupyter notebook cell like this:

    #%%cu
    # This is a CUDA-accelerated code block.
    # You can write your CUDA-accelerated code here.
    # For example, if you have a CUDA function named `cuda_function`, you can call it like this:

    #import cuda_functions
    #cuda_functions.cuda_function(...)
    #%%
    ```
