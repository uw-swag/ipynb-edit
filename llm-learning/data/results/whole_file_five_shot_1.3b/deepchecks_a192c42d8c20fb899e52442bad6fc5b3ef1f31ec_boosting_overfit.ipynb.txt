    The code provided is an example of how to update the examples in a Jupyter notebook. However, the provided code is not complete and does not run as expected. 

    The code is trying to read a dataset from a URL, preprocess it, and then use it to train a model. The model is then checked for overfitting using DeepChecks.

    Please provide the complete code to run the examples.

    The complete code would depend on the specifics of the dataset and the model you want to use.

    Also, please note that the code provided is a general example and may not work as expected. It is recommended to run the code in a proper environment to ensure its correctness.
