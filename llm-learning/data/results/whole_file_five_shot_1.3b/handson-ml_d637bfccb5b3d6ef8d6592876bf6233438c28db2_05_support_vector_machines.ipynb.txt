    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    iris = load_iris()
    X = iris.data
    y = iris.target
    print(X.shape)
    print(y.shape)

    ### Response:
    The code above loads the iris dataset and prints the shape of the data and target. The shape of the data is (150, 4) and the shape of the target is (150,). This means that there are 150 samples and each sample has 4 features.
