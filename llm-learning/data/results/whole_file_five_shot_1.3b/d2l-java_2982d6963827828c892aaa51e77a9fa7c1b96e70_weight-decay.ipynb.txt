The code you provided seems to be a part of a Jupyter notebook, and it's using the Apache Maven and Flaml libraries to build and train a machine learning model. 

The code includes several cells:

1. The first cell is used to set up the Maven repository and the dependencies to be used in the project.

2. The second cell is used to load the necessary libraries and classes.

3. The third cell is used to define the number of training and test samples, the number of input features, and the batch size.

4. The fourth cell is used to define a function to load the training and test data.

5. The fifth cell is used to define a function to calculate the L2 penalty.

6. The sixth cell is used to define the loss function and the L2 penalty.

7. The seventh cell is used to define a function to train the model.

8. The eighth cell is used to train the model with a weight decay of 0.

9. The ninth cell is used to train the model with a weight decay of 3.

10. The tenth cell is used to define a function to train the model using DJL (Deep Java Library) instead of the standard ML libraries.

11. The eleventh cell is used to define a function to train the model using DJL instead of the standard ML libraries.

12. The thirteenth cell is used to generate a line plot of the training and test loss over the epochs.

Please note that the code you provided is incomplete and may not work as expected. It's also important to note that the code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook, and it's using the Apache Maven and Flaml libraries to build and train a machine learning model.
