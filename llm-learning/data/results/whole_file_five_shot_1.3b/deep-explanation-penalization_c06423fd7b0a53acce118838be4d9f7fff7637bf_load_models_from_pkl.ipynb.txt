```python
    import pickle

    # Load the model from the .pkl file
    with open('model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
        model = pickle.load(f)
    ```

    This code will load the model from a .pkl file. The 'rb' stands for read binary. This is used to read the binary data from the file.

    Please replace 'model.pkl' with the path to your .pkl file.
