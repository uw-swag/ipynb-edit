    The code you provided is a DeepChecks example, which is a library for data integrity checks. The example updates the book information.

    The original code was not provided, so I can't provide an exact update. However, I can suggest a possible update based on the information provided.

    If you want to update the book information, you can do so by modifying the 'book_info' variable in the code. For example, you can change the 'title', 'author', 'publisher', 'year', 'isbn', 'pages', 'rating', 'reviews', 'price', 'description', 'pubdate', 'language', 'edition', 'ISBN', 'URL', 'book_image_link', 'language_code', 'average_rating', 'ratings_count', 'reviews_count', 'text_reviews_count', 'book_id' variables.

    Please provide the original code if you need a more specific update.
