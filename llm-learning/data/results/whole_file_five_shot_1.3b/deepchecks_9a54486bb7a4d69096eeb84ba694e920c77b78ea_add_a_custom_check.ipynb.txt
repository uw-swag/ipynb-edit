    The code you provided is a part of a larger codebase and it seems to be related to a specific DeepChecks check, which is used to compare the sizes of the train and test datasets. 

    The check is designed to compare the sizes of the train and test datasets. The sizes are returned as a dictionary and displayed in a bar graph. 

    However, the code you provided is incomplete and does not provide a complete solution. It is missing the actual implementation of the check logic and the display function. 

    Please provide the complete code for the check and its display function.
