    The code you provided is a set of instructions for setting up a machine learning project using the Deep Java Library (DJL) and the Apache Commons Lang library. 

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    1. The first part of the code imports the necessary libraries and dependencies.
    2. The second part of the code loads the necessary libraries and dependencies.
    3. The third part of the code defines a function `l_i_vectorized`.
    4. The fourth part of the code sets up the model architecture using the Djl library.
    5. The fifth part of the code trains the model using the `EasyTrain` class.
    6. The sixth part of the code evaluates the model and prints the results.
    7. The seventh part of the code generates a table with the training and evaluation metrics.
    8. The eighth part of the code generates a line plot of the training metrics.

    Please note that the code is written in a Jupyter notebook format, and it uses the Djl library to define and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The code also uses the Apache Commons Lang library for some utility functions.
