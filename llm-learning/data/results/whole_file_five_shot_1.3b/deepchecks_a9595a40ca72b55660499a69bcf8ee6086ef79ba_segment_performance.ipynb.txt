    ## Code: fixing docs (#898)

    The code snippet provided is a Python script that uses the pandas, sklearn, and deepchecks libraries to load and preprocess data, train a RandomForestClassifier model, and then evaluate the model's performance.

    The script starts by importing necessary libraries and downloading the adult dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It then splits the data into a training set and a validation set.

    The script then encodes the categorical features and fits a SimpleImputer to fill missing values. The script also uses a Pipeline to preprocess the data and a RandomForestClassifier to train the model.

    The script then evaluates the model's performance using the SegmentPerformance check from the deepchecks library.

    The script ends with a comment that explains what the code does.
