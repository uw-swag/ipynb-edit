    The commit message "Minor bugfixes (#101)" suggests that there are minor bug fixes or improvements in the code. The changes are related to the function `new_label_train_validation`, which is used to train and validate a model.

    The first code snippet is a simple test of the `new_label_train_validation` function. It creates two datasets, `test` and `val`, with some data and labels. The function is then called with these datasets.

    The second code snippet is a more complex example. It creates two more datasets, `test` and `val`, with more data and labels. The function is then called with these datasets.

    The function `new_label_train_validation` is expected to perform some form of training and validation on the datasets. The exact behavior of this function is not specified in the original code, but it's assumed to take the form of training on the test dataset and validation on the validation dataset.

    The bug fixes in the code are likely to improve the performance of the function, especially in the case of larger datasets.

    Please note that the actual behavior of the function and the changes made to the code are not specified in the original code.
