    ## Concurrency

    Concurrency is a programming concept where two or more tasks can start, run, and complete at the same time. In the context of Python, concurrency is achieved using the `concurrent.futures` module.

    Here's a simple example of how to use concurrency in Python:

    ```python
    import concurrent.futures

    def worker(n):
        return n*n

    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(worker, n) for n in range(10)]

    for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
        print(future.result())
    ```

    This code will print the squares of the numbers from 0 to 9. The `ThreadPoolExecutor` class is a context manager that creates a pool of worker threads. The `submit` method is used to submit tasks to the executor, and the `as_completed` function is used to iterate over the completed futures in the order they were completed.

    Please note that the `concurrent.futures` module is not a part of the standard Python library, so you need to install it using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install futures
    ```

    ## Concurrency in Python

    Concurrency is a powerful tool in Python that allows you to write concurrent code. The `concurrent.futures` module provides a high-level interface for asynchronously executing callables.

    This module is not a part of the standard Python library, so you need to install it using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install futures
    ```
