    The installation instructions for the code are as follows:

    1. Install the `atomai` library using pip:

       ```
       !pip install atomai
       ```

    2. Install the `ConvBlock` and `UpsampleBlock` classes from the `atomai.nets` module.

    3. Download the "graphene_MD_imgs.npy" file from the provided URL and save it to your working directory.

    4. Load the image data using the `numpy.load` function.

    5. Add noise to the image data using the `numpy.random.normal` function.

    6. Split the image data into training and testing sets using the `atomai.utils.data_split` function.

    7. Define the architecture of the Deep Autoencoder (DAE) using the `torch.nn.Sequential` class.

    8. Compile the training parameters for the DAE using the `atomai.trainers.BaseTrainer` class.

    9. Train the DAE using the `atomai.trainers.BaseTrainer` class.

    10. Use the trained DAE to predict the image data.

    11. Plot the results of the prediction.

    12. Generate some example images and apply the trained DAE to them.

    13. Download the "graphene_exp.npy" file from the provided URL and save it to your working directory.

    14. Load the example data using the `numpy.load` function.

    15. Scale the example data to the range of pixel values used in training data.

    16. Use the trained DAE to predict the example data.

    17. Plot the results of the prediction.

    Please note that the code is written in Python and uses the `atomai` library for the Deep Autoencoder.
