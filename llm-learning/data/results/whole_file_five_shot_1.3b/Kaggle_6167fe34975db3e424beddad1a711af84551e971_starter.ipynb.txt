    ## Here is the code to find the overlap of heroes

    ## First, we need to find the common powers between vision, reality distortion, strength, and thermal powers
    common_powers = pd.merge(vision, reality_dis, on=powers_cat['Reality Distortion'])
    common_powers = pd.merge(common_powers, strength, on=powers_cat['Strength'])
    common_powers = pd.merge(common_powers, thermal, on=powers_cat['Thermal'])

    ## Then, we can find the common powers between vision, reality distortion, strength, and thermal powers
    common_powers = pd.merge(vision, reality_dis, on=powers_cat['Reality Distortion'])
    common_powers = pd.merge(common_powers, strength, on=powers_cat['Strength'])
    common_powers = pd.merge(common_powers, thermal, on=powers_cat['Thermal'])

    ## Finally, we can find the common powers between vision, reality distortion, strength, and thermal powers
