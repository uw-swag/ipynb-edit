    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that includes several cells. Each cell is a piece of code that performs a specific task. Here's a brief overview of what each cell does:

    1. `<Cell_0>`: This cell is used to display an image from a URL. The image is a Mozilla Developer Network's logo.

    2. `<Cell_1>`: This cell is used to install the `deepchecks` library using pip.

    3. `<Cell_2>`: This cell is used to import the necessary libraries and set a seed for reproducibility.

    4. `<Cell_3>`: This cell is used to import the `load_data` function from the `deepchecks.datasets.classification.phishing` module.

    5. `<Cell_4>`: This cell is used to load the data into a pandas DataFrame.

    6. `<Cell_5>`: This cell is used to display the shape of the DataFrame.

    7. `<Cell_6>`: This cell is used to display the first 5 rows of the DataFrame.

    8. `<Cell_7>`: This cell is used to display the column names of the DataFrame.

    9. `<Cell_8>`: This cell is used to create an instance of the `single_dataset_integrity` suite.

    10. `<Cell_9>`: This cell is used to run the suite on the DataFrame.

    11. `<Cell_10>`: This cell is used to split the DataFrame into training and testing sets.

    12. `<Cell_11>`: This cell is used to preprocess the DataFrame using the `get_url_preprocessor` function.

    13. `<Cell_12>`: This cell is used to fit the preprocessed DataFrame to the training set.

    14. `<Cell_13>`: This cell is used to transform the preprocessed DataFrame to the testing set.

    15. `<Cell_14>`: This cell is used to train a logistic regression model on the training set.
