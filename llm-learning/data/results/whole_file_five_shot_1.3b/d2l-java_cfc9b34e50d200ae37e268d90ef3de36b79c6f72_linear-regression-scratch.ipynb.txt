    The code you provided is a part of a machine learning project, and it's a linear regression model trained using gradient descent. The model is trained on synthetic data generated using a random normal distribution. The model's parameters are updated using gradient descent, and the model's performance is evaluated using the mean squared error loss.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The `DataPoints` class is a simple data point class with two attributes: `X` and `y`.
    - The `syntheticData` function generates synthetic data using a random normal distribution.
    - The `linreg` function performs a linear regression on the given data.
    - The `squaredLoss` function computes the mean squared error loss.
    - The `sgd` function performs stochastic gradient descent on the given parameters.
    - The main part of the code trains the model on the synthetic data, updates the model's parameters using gradient descent, and evaluates the model's performance.

    The code also includes a few comments to explain the steps of the process.

    Please note that the code is written in Java and uses the Deep Java Library (DJL) for machine learning.

    The gradients are cleared from the previous batch in the `sgd` function before each iteration. This is done to prevent the gradients from being accumulated from previous iterations.

    The code also includes a few print statements to display the model's parameters and the model's performance.
