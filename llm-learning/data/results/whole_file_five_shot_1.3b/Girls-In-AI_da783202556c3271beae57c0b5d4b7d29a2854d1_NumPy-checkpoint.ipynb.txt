    ### Response:
    You can update the picture link by replacing the 'pic_link' with the new link.

    For example, if you want to update the picture link to 'https://example.com/new_pic.jpg', you can do:

    ```python
    pic_link = 'https://example.com/new_pic.jpg'
    ```

    Then, you can use this link in your code.
