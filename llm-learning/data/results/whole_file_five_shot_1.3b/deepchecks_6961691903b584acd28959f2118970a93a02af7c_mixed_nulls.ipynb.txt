```
    The commit message "[Automatic] Examples Update (#591)" suggests that the examples have been updated to reflect the latest changes in the Deepchecks library. The Deepchecks library is a Python library for data quality checks, and the examples provided in the commit are examples of how to use the library to perform data quality checks.

    The first example uses the MixedNulls check, which is a data quality check that checks for mixed nulls in a DataFrame. The second example uses the MixedNulls check with additional columns, which is a more complex example.

    The updated examples should now provide a more comprehensive understanding of how to use the MixedNulls check in a DataFrame.

    Please note that the actual results of the examples may vary depending on the specific DataFrame and the data quality checks being performed.

    The commit message "[Automatic] Examples Update (#591)" is automatically generated based on the changes made to the examples.
