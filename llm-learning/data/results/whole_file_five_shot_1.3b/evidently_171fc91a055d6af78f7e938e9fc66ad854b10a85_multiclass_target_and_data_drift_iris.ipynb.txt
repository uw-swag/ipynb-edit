    The new list widget (#172) is a new feature in the evidently library. The widget is a new way to visualize and analyze the data drift between two datasets. The new widget provides a more comprehensive view of the data drift between two datasets, including the distribution of the data, the correlation between the data, and the impact of the data drift on the model's performance.

    The new widget is designed to be more user-friendly and intuitive, allowing users to easily compare and analyze the data drift between two datasets. It also provides a way to visualize the data drift, which can be useful for understanding the impact of the data drift on the model's performance.

    The new widget is available in the evidently library as a new tab in the dashboard. The tab name is 'Data Drift'. The tab can be added to the dashboard by setting the 'Data Drift' tab as the first tab in the 'tabs' parameter when creating the dashboard.

    The new widget is also available as a standalone profile section. The profile section name is 'Data Drift'. The profile section can be used to calculate the data drift between two datasets. The 'Data Drift' profile section provides a detailed report of the data drift between two datasets, including the distribution of the data, the correlation between the data, and the impact of the data drift on the model's performance.

    The new widget and the profile section are available in the evidently library. The widget can be used to visualize the data drift between two datasets, while the profile section can be used to calculate the data drift and provide a detailed report of the data drift.
