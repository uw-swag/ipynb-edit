    The notebooks you've provided are used for training an AdaBoost classifier and a regression model, and then evaluating their performance. 

    Here's a brief explanation of what each code cell does:

    - `<Cell_0>`: This cell imports necessary libraries and modules.
    - `<Cell_1>`: This cell loads the iris dataset and creates a AdaBoost classifier.
    - `<Cell_2>`: This cell uses the DeepChecks library to create a performance report for the training dataset.
    - `<Cell_3>`: This cell does the same as `<Cell_1>`, but for the diabetes dataset.
    - `<Cell_4>`: This cell uses the DeepChecks library to create a performance report for the test dataset.

    The notebooks are designed to be interactive and allow you to experiment with different models and datasets. You can run the notebooks in a Jupyter notebook or any other Python environment.

    Please note that the DeepChecks library is a powerful tool for exploratory data analysis and model evaluation. It provides a wide range of checks for different types of datasets and models.

    Also, please note that the performance of the models can vary depending on the random state of the train-test split.

    Finally, the notebooks are designed to be run in a Jupyter notebook environment. If you're not using a Jupyter notebook, you may need to adjust the code to fit your environment.
