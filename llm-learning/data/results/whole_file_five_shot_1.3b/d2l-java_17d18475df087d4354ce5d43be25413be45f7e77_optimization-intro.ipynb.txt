    The commit message "bump of D2L Java book version to 0.8.0 (#58)" is a release update for the D2L Java book. The version number 0.8.0 represents a major update that includes several new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

    The code cells in the commit message are related to the development of the book. Here's a brief explanation of the changes:

    1. The `%maven` command is used to add Maven dependencies to the project. The `ai.djl:api:0.7.0-SNAPSHOT` and `ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-engine:0.7.0-SNAPSHOT` dependencies are the latest versions of the D2L Java book.

    2. The `%maven ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-native-auto:1.7.0-b` dependency is a snapshot version of the mxnet-native-auto dependency, which is used for building native extensions for the MXNet library.

    3. The `%load ../utils/plot-utils` command is used to load the PlotUtils class from the `../utils/plot-utils` directory.

    4. The `import ai.djl.ndarray.*;` statement imports the necessary classes from the `ai.djl.ndarray` package.

    5. The `callFunc` method is defined, which takes an array of floats and a function as input, and returns an array of floats.

    6. The `f`, `g`, `cube`, `tanh` functions are defined and used in the code.

    7. The `NDManager`, `NDArray`, `Table`, `LinePlot`, `FloatColumn`, and `StringColumn` classes are used to create and display plots and tables.

    8. The `LinePlot.create` method is used to create a line plot with the specified title, data, x-axis, y-axis, and grouping column.

    The commit message is a good example of a clear and concise release note, which helps others understand the changes in a release.
