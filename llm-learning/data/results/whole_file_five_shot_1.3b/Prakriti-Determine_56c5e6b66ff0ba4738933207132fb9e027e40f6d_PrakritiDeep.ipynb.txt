    The code you provided is a mix of Python and Jupyter notebook cells. It's a mix of data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. Here's a brief explanation of what each section of the code does:

    1. **Importing necessary libraries**: The code imports the necessary libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.

    2. **Reading the dataset**: The code reads the dataset from a CSV file.

    3. **Splitting the dataset**: The code splits the dataset into features (X) and target variable (Y).

    4. **Training the model**: The code trains the model using the training data.

    5. **Predicting on the test data**: The code uses the trained model to predict the target variable for the test data.

    6. **Evaluating the model**: The code evaluates the model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

    7. **Plotting the confusion matrix**: The code plots the confusion matrix, which is a table that describes the performance of a classification model.

    8. **Calculating the recall, precision, and F1 score**: The code calculates the recall, precision, and F1 score of the model.

    9. **Making predictions on a new sample**: The code makes predictions on a new sample using the trained model.

    10. **Checking the predicted class**: The code checks the predicted class of a new sample.

    11. **Calculating the percentage of each class**: The code calculates the percentage of each class in the predicted data.

    12. **Printing the results**: The code prints the results of the model's performance, including the confusion matrix, recall, precision, and F1 score.

    13. **Printing the prakruti percentages**: The code prints the prakruti percentages.

    14. **Deleting the maximum value from the prakruti percentages**: The code deletes the maximum value from the prakruti percentages.

    15. **Printing the maximum value from each class**: The code prints the maximum
