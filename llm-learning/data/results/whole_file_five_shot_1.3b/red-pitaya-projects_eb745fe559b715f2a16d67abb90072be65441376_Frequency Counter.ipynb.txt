    The code you provided is a Python script that uses the `mmap` module to access the AXI GPIO (Advanced eXtensible Interface General Purpose Input/Output) registers of the FPGA. The script reads the count from the AXI GPIO registers and prints it out.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The script first opens the memory-mapped file for the AXI GPIO registers.
    - It then reads the contents of the AXI GPIO registers into a NumPy array.
    - The script then prints the contents of the array, which should include the count of the AXI GPIO registers.
    - Finally, the script accesses the second AXI GPIO interface and prints its contents.

    Please note that this code is for a specific FPGA and may not work on other types of FPGA or other systems.

    Also, the code assumes that the FPGA has a specific memory-mapped register for the AXI GPIO registers. The exact register addresses and the exact contents of the registers may vary depending on the FPGA and the specific implementation.

    Finally, the code also assumes that the FPGA has a specific clock frequency. The exact clock frequency may vary depending on the FPGA and the specific implementation.

    Please replace the `freq`, `log2_Ncycles`, `freq_in`, and `phase_inc` values with the actual values for your specific FPGA and system.

    Also, please note that the code is a simple example and may not cover all edge cases or error conditions.
