The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook that uses DeepChecks, a library for data-driven deep learning. The notebook is designed to demonstrate the concept of label drift in the context of image classification and object detection tasks.

The `TrainTestLabelDrift` check in DeepChecks is used to detect if the labels in the training and test datasets are drifting. This is done by comparing the distribution of labels in the training and test datasets. If the distributions of labels are significantly different, it indicates that the labels are drifting.

The code snippet at `<Cell_3>` and `<Cell_5>` is an example of how to use the `TrainTestLabelDrift` check. The `TrainTestLabelDrift` check is run on the `train_ds` and `test_ds` datasets, which are created from the MNIST and COCO datasets respectively.

The code snippet at `<Cell_4>` and `<Cell_6>` is an example of how to use the `TrainTestLabelDrift` check with a different dataset. The `TrainTestLabelDrift` check is run on the `train_ds` and `test_ds` datasets, which are created from the YOLO format of the COCO dataset.

The `TrainTestLabelDrift` check returns a report of the label drift. The report includes the number of samples that are drifting, the percentage of drifting samples, and the distribution of drifting labels.

The `TrainTestLabelDrift` check is part of the DeepChecks vision library, which is a part of the DeepChecks library.
