    The commit message "Upgrade to 0.11.0 (#139)" indicates that the version of the AI-DJL library being used has been updated to version 0.11.0. This update includes several improvements and bug fixes, including the addition of new features and bug fixes.

    The original code cells are mostly about importing necessary libraries, defining functions, and initializing some variables. However, the commit message indicates that the execution count of the metadata is being set to 'null' instead of being removed. This is a change in the code to ensure that the execution count is not included in the metadata, which is a common practice in Python.

    The code also includes a function to train a model using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer, which is a popular choice for deep learning models. The function `trainSgd` is used to train the model with the SGD optimizer and different learning rates.

    The code also includes a function to train a model using a concise implementation, which is a more efficient way to train models compared to the default implementation. The function `trainConciseCh11` is used to train the model using the concise implementation.

    The code also includes a function to convert a float array to a log scale, which is useful for visualizing the performance of a model.

    The code also includes a function to evaluate the performance of a model, which is used to compare the performance of different models.

    The code also includes a function to plot the loss vs. time graph, which is used to visualize the performance of a model.

    The code also includes a function to train a model using a specific optimizer, which is used to train the model with a specific optimizer.

    The code also includes a function to train a model using a specific dataset, which is used to train the model with a specific dataset.

    The code also includes a function to get the type of a model, which is used to get the type of a model.

    The code also includes a function to convert a float array to a log scale, which is used to convert a float array to a log scale.

    The code also includes a function to train a model using a specific loss function, which is used to train the model with a specific loss function.
