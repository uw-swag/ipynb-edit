    ### Overview

    This project is about predicting the outcome of a football match based on various features of the match. The data used in this project is collected from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/the-guardian-who-says-no-one-else-cares/football-data) platform. The data includes information about the seasons, teams, players, and matches.

    ### Data

    The data is divided into two parts:

    1. Training data: This is used to train the model. The data includes features like the number of goals scored by the home team, away team, the number of matches played, the season, the date of the match, the home team's and away team's goals, and the result of the match (Home Team Win, Draw, Away Team Win).

    2. Testing data: This is used to evaluate the performance of the model. The data includes the same features as the training data, but the result of the match is unknown.

    ### Features

    The features used in this project are:

    - Number of goals scored by the home team
    - Number of goals scored by the away team
    - Number of matches played
    - Season
    - Date of the match
    - Result of the match (Home Team Win, Draw, Away Team Win)

    ### Models

    The project uses two different models to predict the outcome of the match:

    1. Random Forest Classifier: This model is used for the training data. It is a powerful model that can handle a large number of features and is capable of handling complex relationships.

    2. Gradient Boosting Classifier: This model is used for the testing data. It is a less powerful model that can handle a large number of features and is less likely to overfit the training data.

    ### Evaluation

    The project uses accuracy as the evaluation metric for both the training and testing data. The accuracy of the model is the proportion of correct predictions made by the model.

    ### Future Work

    The project could be extended to include more features, to use more complex models, to use more advanced techniques for feature engineering, and to use more advanced techniques
