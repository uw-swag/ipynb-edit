    ## How to Generate Test Generators
    Test generators are a powerful tool in data science. They allow you to generate test data for your models.

    Here's an example of how to use test generators:

    ```python
    from sklearn.datasets import make_classification

    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_informative=15, n_redundant=5, random_state=42)
    ```

    This will generate a random classification dataset with 1000 samples, 20 features, 15 informative features, 5 redundant features, and a random state of 42.

    You can replace `make_classification` with any other test generator that suits your needs.
