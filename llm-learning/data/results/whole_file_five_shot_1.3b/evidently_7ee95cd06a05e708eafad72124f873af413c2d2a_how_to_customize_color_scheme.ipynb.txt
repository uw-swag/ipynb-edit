    ## Color Options

    The color options in the plotting module allow you to customize the color of the plot. This is done by passing a string to the `color` parameter in the `plot` function. The string can be one of the following:

    - `'b'`, `'black'`, `'w'`, `'white'`: These are the names of the eight basic colors in matplotlib.
    - A 3-character hexadecimal color code, such as `'#FF0000'` for red, `'#00FF00'` for green, and `'#0000FF'` for blue.
    - A 4-character RGBA color code, such as `'rgba(255,0,0,1.0)'` for a red color.

    For example, to plot a red line with the color 'b', you would use:

    ```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    x = np.linspace(-5., 5., 200)
    y = x
    plt.plot(x, y, color='b')
    plt.show()
    ```

    This will create a plot with a red line.
