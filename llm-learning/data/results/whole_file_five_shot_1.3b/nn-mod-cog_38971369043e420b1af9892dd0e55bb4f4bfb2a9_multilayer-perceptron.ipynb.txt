    The code you've provided is a collection of Python code snippets, which are used to perform a variety of tasks, such as:

    1. Initializing parameters for a multi-layer perceptron using the `init_parameters` function.
    2. Implementing a simple linear regression model using the `fit` function.
    3. Implementing a sigmoid function using the `sigmoid_function` function.
    4. Implementing a cost function using the `cost_function` function.
    5. Implementing a predict function using the `predict` function.
    6. Using the `fit` function to train a multi-layer perceptron model.
    7. Using the trained model to make predictions on new data.
    8. Plotting the errors and the accuracy of the model over time.

    Please note that the code is written in a Jupyter notebook format, and it uses the libraries `scipy`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `altair`.
