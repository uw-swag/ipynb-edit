    The code you provided is a TensorFlow implementation of a denoising autoencoder for time series data. The denoising process is done by adding Gaussian noise to the input data. The model is trained to reconstruct the original data from the noisy data. The model's performance is evaluated by comparing the denoised data with the original data.

    However, the code you provided is incomplete and does not provide a complete solution. It only includes the data loading, model building, and training parts. The model's performance is not evaluated and the denoising process is not implemented.

    Please provide more details or the complete code so that I can assist you better.
