The code cells you provided are mostly about data processing, machine learning, and TensorFlow. Here's a brief explanation of what each section does:

1. `dhtml`: This function is used to display HTML content in a Jupyter notebook. It's used to display text in a different font style.

2. `pd_style`: This function is used to define the style for pandas dataframe.

3. `df.head(10).style.background_gradient('cool', axis=1)`: This line is used to display the first 10 rows of the dataframe in a gradient color background.

4. `df.dropna().reset_index(drop=True)`: This line is used to drop the missing values in the dataframe and reset the index.

5. `train_input_fn` and `test_input_fn`: These functions are used to create input for the machine learning model.

6. `reg.train(input_fn=lambda: train_input_fn(dfn_train, batch_size), steps=steps)`: This line is used to train the model.

7. `reloaded_reg.evaluate(input_fn=lambda: test_input_fn(dfn_test, batch_size))`: This line is used to evaluate the model on the test data.

8. `py_test`: This is a list that contains the predicted values from the model.

9. `pl.figure(figsize=(10,4))`: This line is used to create a figure with a specific size.

10. `pl.plot(range(len(dfn_test)),dfn_test['MPG'],'-o',label='real data',c='#9955ee',ms=7)`: This line is used to plot the real data and the predicted values.

Please note that the code you provided is quite long and complex, and it's hard to understand all the details without context. I've removed some of the code to keep the structure of the notebook clear.
