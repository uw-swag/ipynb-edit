The issue you're facing seems to be related to the way the Maven repository is configured. The `%mavenRepo` command is used to add a Maven repository to your notebook, but it seems like you're not using it correctly.

The `%mavenRepo` command is used to specify the URL of the Maven repository, but it's not used to add a repository to your notebook. The correct command to add a repository to your notebook is `%repo`.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

```jupyter
%mavenRepo snapshots https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/

%maven ai.djl:api:0.7.0-SNAPSHOT
%maven ai.djl:basicdataset:0.7.0-SNAPSHOT
%maven org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.26
%maven org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:1.7.26

%maven ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-engine:0.7.0-SNAPSHOT
%maven ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-native-auto:1.7.0-b

%repo https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/
```

After adding the repository, you should be able to import the necessary libraries and dependencies without any issues.
