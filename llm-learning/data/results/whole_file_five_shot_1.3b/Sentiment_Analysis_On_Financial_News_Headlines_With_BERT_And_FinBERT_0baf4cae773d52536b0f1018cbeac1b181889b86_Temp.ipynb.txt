    This code will upload a file to a Google Cloud Storage bucket. The `upload_blob` function takes three arguments: the name of the bucket, the local path to the file, and the name of the blob (the name that will be used in the bucket).

    Please replace 'my_bucket', 'local/path/to/my/file.txt', and 'my_blob_name' with your actual bucket name, local file path, and blob name respectively.

    Also, you need to have a Google Cloud Storage bucket and the necessary permissions to upload files to it.

    Note: This code requires the Google Cloud SDK and the google-cloud-storage library to be installed.
