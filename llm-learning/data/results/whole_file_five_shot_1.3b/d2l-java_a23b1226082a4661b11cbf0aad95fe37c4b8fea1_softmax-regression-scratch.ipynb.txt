    The code you've provided is a mix of Maven dependencies and Jupyter notebook code. It's a combination of Maven dependencies for AI/ML related libraries, Jupyter notebook code for data manipulation and analysis, and Python code for machine learning model training.

    The code is not complete and it seems like it's incomplete because it's missing some parts. However, it should give you a good idea of what the code is doing.

    The code is using AI/ML libraries like DJL (Deep Java Library) for deep learning model training, and it's using a softmax function for the output layer of the neural network. It's also using a custom loss function for the model training.

    The code is also using Python for some parts, but it's not complete. It's missing some parts, such as the definition of the `softmax` function, the `Accumulator` class, and the `trainEpochCh3` function.

    The code is also using a custom function for updating the parameters of the neural network, and it's using a custom function for training the neural network.

    The code is also using a custom function for predicting the labels of the images in the dataset, and it's using a custom function for showing the images.

    The code is also using a custom function for training the neural network.
