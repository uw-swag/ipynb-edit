    ## Description

    This notebook is about using the FastAI library to perform image and pose estimation. FastAI is a modern library for deep learning that provides a simple and efficient way to build and train models.

    The notebook covers the following topics:

    1. **Data loading and exploration**: It loads the BIWI dataset, which is a dataset for biomechanical image-based human pose estimation. It also explores the dataset and its contents.

    2. **Image and pose extraction**: It shows how to extract image and pose information from a given image.

    3. **Image and pose conversion**: It converts the extracted pose information into a format that can be used in a machine learning model.

    4. **Data preprocessing and augmentation**: It preprocesses the data, and it also demonstrates how to perform data augmentation to increase the size of the training set.

    5. **Model training**: It trains a model using the preprocessed data. It also demonstrates how to use the FastAI library to train the model.

    6. **Model evaluation and optimization**: It evaluates the model's performance, and it also optimizes the model's parameters to improve its performance.

    7. **Model visualization**: It shows how to visualize the model's performance and the learned features.

    The notebook also includes a section for tensorboard logging, which is a tool for visualizing the performance of machine learning models.
