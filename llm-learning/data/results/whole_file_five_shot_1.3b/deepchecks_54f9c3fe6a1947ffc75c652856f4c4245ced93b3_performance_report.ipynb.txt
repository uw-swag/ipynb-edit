The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook, and it's used to train an AdaBoost classifier and a AdaBoost regressor on the iris dataset and the diabetes dataset, respectively. The performance of these models is then evaluated using a PerformanceReport.

The notebook is divided into several cells, each of which performs a specific task. The cells are numbered to indicate their order. The first cell loads the necessary libraries and data, while the last cell evaluates the performance of the models.

The code you provided is a good example of how to use DeepChecks, a library for building and analyzing machine learning models, to evaluate the performance of AdaBoost classifiers and regressors.
