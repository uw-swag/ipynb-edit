    The code you provided is a simple example of using the Evidently library to create a dashboard and save it to an HTML file. The dashboard is a gallery of widgets, and the code calculates some data and saves the dashboard to an HTML file. The dashboard is then displayed inline in the Jupyter notebook.

    If you're using an older version of the Evidently library, you might need to update your code to use the latest version. The code you provided is for the latest version of the library.
