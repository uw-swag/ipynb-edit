The NaiveModelComparison check in the Deepchecks library is used to compare the performance of a model with a naive model. The naive model is a model that does not make any assumptions about the data. It's a baseline model that can be used to compare the performance of a model with a real-world scenario.

The NaiveModelComparison check in Deepchecks has a parameter `naive_model_type` which can be set to 'statistical' to compare the model's performance with a statistical naive model. The statistical naive model is a model that makes no assumptions about the data. It's a baseline model that can be used to compare the performance of a model with a real-world scenario.

In your code, you're using the NaiveModelComparison check to compare the performance of your RandomForestClassifier model with a naive model.
