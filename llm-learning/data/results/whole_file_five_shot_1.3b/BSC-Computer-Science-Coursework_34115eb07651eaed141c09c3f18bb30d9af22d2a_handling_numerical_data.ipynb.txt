    ## Data Science Practical 03: Handling Numerical Data

    In this practical, we will explore how to handle numerical data in data science. We will use Python's `numpy` and `sklearn` libraries to handle numerical data.

    ### Part 1: Min-Max Scaling

    Min-Max Scaling is a technique that scales the data to a range between 0 and 1. It's often used in data preprocessing.

    Here's how to do it:

    ```python
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn import preprocessing

    feature = np.array([
                        [-500.5],
                        [-100.1],
                        [0],
                        [100.11],
                        [900.9]
                      ])

    minmax_scaler = preprocessing.MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0,1))
    scaled_feature = minmax_scaler.fit_transform(feature)

    print(scaled_feature)
    ```

    ### Part 2: Standard Scaling

    Standard Scaling is a technique that standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. It's often used in data preprocessing.

    Here's how to do it:

    ```python
    from sklearn import preprocessing

    feature = np.array([
                        [-1000.1],
                        [-200.2],
                        [500.5],
                        [600.6] ,
                        [9000.9]
                      ])

    scaler  =  preprocessing.StandardScaler()
    standardized = scaler.fit_transform(feature)

    print(standardized)
    ```

    ### Part 3: Robust Scaling

    Robust Scaling is a technique that scales the data to have a median of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It's often used in data preprocessing.

    Here's how to do it:

    ```python
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler
