    # Section 9.2: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    ## LSTM is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is particularly well-suited for time series data.
    ## LSTM has three main components: the cell state, the forget gate, and the input gate.
    ## The cell state is a vector that captures the information about the current state of the LSTM.
    ## The forget gate allows the LSTM to forget information about the previous state, while the input gate allows it to input new information.
    ## The output of the LSTM is a combination of the cell state and the hidden state, which is then passed through a softmax function to produce the final output.
    ```
    ## LSTM is used in various applications such as sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and time series prediction.
    ## LSTM is also used in the field of deep learning, where it has been used as a building block for more complex models.
    ## LSTM is also used in the field of natural language processing, where it has been used to predict the next word in a sentence.
    ## LSTM is also used in the field of computer vision, where it has been used to recognize objects in images.
    ## LSTM is also used in the field of financial time series, where it has been used to predict stock prices.
    ## LSTM is also used in the field of speech recognition, where it has been used to recognize the speaker of a speech.
    ## LSTM is also used in the field of natural language generation, where it has been used to generate human-like text.
