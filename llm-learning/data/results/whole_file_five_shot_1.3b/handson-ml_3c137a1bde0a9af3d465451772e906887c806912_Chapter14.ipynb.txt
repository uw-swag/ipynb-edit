    # Chapter 14: Introduction to Machine Learning
    # This chapter will cover the basics of machine learning, including the definition, types, and applications of machine learning.

    ## 1. Definition of Machine Learning
    # Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is primarily used in applications that require data mining, data exploration, and data interpretation.

    ## 2. Types of Machine Learning
    # There are several types of machine learning, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.

    ### Supervised Learning
    # Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset. The model is then used to predict the output for unseen data. Examples of supervised learning algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, and k-nearest neighbors.

    ### Unsupervised Learning
    # Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on an unlabeled dataset. The model is used to find patterns and structures in the data. Examples of unsupervised learning algorithms include clustering, association rule mining, and dimensionality reduction.

    ### Reinforcement Learning
    # Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some type of reward. Examples of reinforcement learning algorithms include Q-learning, Markov Decision Processes, and Deep Q-Networks.

    ## 3. Applications of Machine Learning
    # Machine learning is used in a wide range of applications, including but not limited to:

    ### Healthcare
    # Machine learning can be used to predict disease progression, diagnose diseases, and improve patient care.

    ### Finance
    # Machine learning can be used to predict stock prices, optimize investment strategies, and detect fraudulent activities.

    ### Marketing
    # Machine learning can be used to analyze customer behavior, predict customer churn, and optimize marketing strategies.

    ### Retail
    # Machine learning can be used to analyze customer behavior, optimize inventory, and improve customer service.

    ### E-commerce
    # Machine learning can be used to analyze customer behavior, recommend products, and optimize sales.

    ### Social Media
    # Machine learning can be used
