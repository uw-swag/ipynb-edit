    The final LSTM implementation is complete. The code reads the EDF files, preprocesses the data, and then trains the LSTM model.

    The LSTM model is trained to predict the next seizure in the EDF file. The model is trained for 10 epochs.

    The model is then saved and used to predict the next seizure in the test dataset.

    The final LSTM model is saved in the 'models' directory.

    The model is then used to predict the next seizure in the test dataset.
