    The commit message "Updated naming & bug fix" is a bit vague, but it seems to be related to the naming of the variables, the bug fix in the code, and the update of the Dashboard tabs. 

    The code cells are:

    - `<Cell_0>` to `<Cell_1>`: Importing necessary libraries and loading the Boston housing dataset.
    - `<Cell_2>` to `<Cell_3>`: Converting the dataset to a pandas DataFrame.
    - `<Cell_4>` to `<Cell_5>`: Creating a Dashboard object and showing it.
    - `<Cell_6>` to `<Cell_7>`: Saving the Dashboard object to an HTML file.
    - `<Cell_8>` to `<Cell_9>`: Updating the column mapping in the Dashboard object.
    - `<Cell_10>` to `<Cell_11>`: Adding the target column to the DataFrame.
    - `<Cell_12>` to `<Cell_13>`: Creating a Dashboard object with the updated column mapping and showing it.
    - `<Cell_14>`: Saving the Dashboard object to an HTML file.

    The code seems to be mostly correct, but there are some bugs in the code.
