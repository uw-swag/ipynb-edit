    ## File Classification

    This script uses the Edge Impulse Linux SDK to classify audio files. The script reads an audio file, processes it, and then classifies the audio using the Edge Impulse model. The classification result is then printed to the console.

    The script uses the following steps:

    1. It imports the necessary libraries and classes.
    2. It initializes the ImpulseRunner class with the model file.
    3. It reads the audio file and extracts the features.
    4. It classifies the features using the ImpulseRunner's classify method.
    5. It prints the classification result to the console.
    6. It finds the label with the highest confidence index and prints it along with the confidence score.

    ## Usage

    To use this script, you need to have the Edge Impulse model file and the audio file you want to classify.

    The model file should be named 'modelfile.eim' and the audio file should be named 'float_wave_test_raw.wav'.

    You can run the script with the following command:

    ```
    python3 script.py
    ```

    Please replace 'script.py' with the name of your Python script.

    ## Note

    This script is a basic example and may not work perfectly for all audio files. The accuracy of the classification depends on the quality of the audio file and the model used.
