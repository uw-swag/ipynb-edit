    ## Session 3: Overview

    In this session, we've learned about the basics of using a deep learning model for image processing, specifically a type of model known as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We've also learned how to preprocess and normalize images, and how to train a CNN on a custom dataset. We've also learned how to use a deep learning library, TensorFlow, to implement and train our CNN.

    In the next session, we'll delve deeper into the details of the model, including how to understand the impact of different parameters, how to use different types of layers in the network, and how to use dropout and other regularization techniques. We'll also learn how to use a more complex model, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), to generate new images.

    In the final session, we'll put everything we've learned into practice, creating a music and speech separation system using a CNN. We'll also learn how to use DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) to analyze audio data.

    This session is designed to be interactive, allowing you to experiment with different parameters and techniques to see how they affect the performance of your model.
