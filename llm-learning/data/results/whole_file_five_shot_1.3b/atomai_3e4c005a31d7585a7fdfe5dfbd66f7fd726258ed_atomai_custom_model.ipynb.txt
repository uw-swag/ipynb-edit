    The code you provided seems to be a part of a Jupyter notebook and it's trying to download and process data from a URL, which is not working as expected. 

    The issue could be due to several reasons:

    1. The URL you're trying to access might be incorrect or the server might be down.
    2. The file you're trying to download might not be in the expected format.
    3. The file might be too large to be downloaded in one go.

    You can try to download the file manually and then use the code to process it. If the problem persists, you might need to check the URL or the file itself.

    If you're using a Jupyter notebook, you can use the `wget` command to download the file directly from the URL. For example, you can use the following command to download the file:

    ```python
    !wget -O "graphene_MD_imgs.npy" https://www.dropbox.com/s/r2cz8jqc9m19gaj/cropped_images_new.npy?dl=1
    ```

    This command will download the file "cropped_images_new.npy" from the URL "https://www.dropbox.com/s/r2cz8jqc9m19gaj/cropped_images_new.npy?dl=1" to the current directory.

    If the file is not in the expected format, you can use the `numpy.load` function to load the file. For example:

    ```python
    imgdata = np.load("graphene_MD_imgs.npy")[::3]
    ```

    This command will load the file "graphene_MD_imgs.npy" and take a portion of it, which is a 3D array.

    If the file is too large to be downloaded in one go, you can use the `numpy.memmap` function to load the file in chunks. For example:

    ```python
    import numpy as np
    chunksize = 100000
    memmap_
