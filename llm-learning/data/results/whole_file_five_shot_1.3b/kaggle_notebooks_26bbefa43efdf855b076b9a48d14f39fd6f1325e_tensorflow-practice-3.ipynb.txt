    The code cells you provided are mostly for data loading, preprocessing, and model training. However, there are a few cells that seem to be related to the removal of Katas (Keras Notebooks) and the revamping of the code structure. 

    The first cell is a function that converts a string to an HTML heading. The second cell is a function that loads and preprocesses data from a variety of sources. The third cell is a function that resizes images and displays them. The fourth cell is a function that creates a pre-trained model and trains it. The fifth cell is a function that resizes and displays images from a CIFAR-10 dataset. The sixth cell is a function that resizes and displays images from a Flower Color Images dataset. The seventh cell is a function that loads a pre-trained model and evaluates it. The eighth cell is a function that resizes and displays images from a MobileNetV2 dataset. The ninth cell is a function that resizes and displays images from a MobileNetV1 dataset. The tenth cell is a function that resizes and displays images from a MNIST dataset. The eleventh cell is a function that resizes and displays images from a Traditional Decor Patterns dataset. The thirteenth cell is a function that resizes and displays images from a Classification of Handwritten Letters dataset. The fourteenth cell is a function that resizes and displays images from a DecorColorImages dataset.
