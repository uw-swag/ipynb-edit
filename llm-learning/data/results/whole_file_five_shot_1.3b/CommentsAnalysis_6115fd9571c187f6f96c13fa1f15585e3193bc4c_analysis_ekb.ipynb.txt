```python
    import tensorflow as tf
    from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
    from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Dropout

    # Assuming that we have a dataset in the form of a numpy array
    # Let's assume that the dataset is 3D and has shape (samples, timesteps, features)
    X = np.random.rand(100, 10, 5)
    y = np.random.rand(100, 1)

    # Define the LSTM model
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(10, 5)))
    model.add(Dense(1))

    # Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, verbose=0)
    ```

    This is a simple example of a LSTM model. The model is defined with an LSTM layer and a dense output layer. The model is then compiled with the Adam optimizer and the mean squared error loss function. The model is then trained on the dataset.

    Please note that you need to replace the `X` and `y` with your actual data. The `X` should be a 3D numpy array with shape (samples, timesteps, features), and `y` should be a 2D numpy array with shape (samples, 1).

    Also, the number of epochs and the batch size can be adjusted according to your needs.
