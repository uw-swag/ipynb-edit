    It seems like you're trying to migrate a GitHub organization to a DeepJavaLibrary (DJL) project. DJL is a machine learning library for Java that provides a high-level API for building and training machine learning models.

    Here's a brief overview of the steps you might need to take:

    1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**: This will be your new home for your project.

    2. **Clone the new repository to your local machine**: This will allow you to work on your project locally.

    3. **Migrate the code from the old repository to the new one**: This will involve copying the code from the old repository to the new one.

    4. **Update the project's dependencies**: This will involve updating the dependencies in your project's `pom.xml` file to point to the new repository.

    5. **Test the project**: Make sure to thoroughly test your project to ensure it works as expected.

    Please note that this is a high-level overview and the actual steps may vary depending on the specifics of your project and the structure of your GitHub organization.

    Also, remember to update any references to the old repository in your project to the new one.

    Finally, don't forget to commit and push your changes to GitHub.

    This is a complex task that requires a good understanding of both Git and Java. If you're not comfortable with these technologies, you might want to consider hiring a professional developer or a team to help you with this task.
