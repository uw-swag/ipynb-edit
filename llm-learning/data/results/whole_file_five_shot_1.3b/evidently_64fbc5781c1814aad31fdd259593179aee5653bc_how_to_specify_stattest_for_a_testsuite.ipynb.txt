The code you've provided is a mix of Python and Jupyter notebook cells. It's a comprehensive project on machine learning and data analysis, with a focus on statistical tests and data drift.

Here's a brief explanation of the cells:

- Cell_0: This cell imports the necessary libraries. It first checks if the `evidently` library is installed, and if not, it installs it using `yarn` and then installs the `evidently` package using `pip`.

- Cell_1: This cell imports the necessary libraries and sets up some warnings to ignore.

- Cell_2: This cell imports the necessary libraries and sets up some warnings to ignore.

- Cell_3: This cell imports the necessary libraries and sets up some warnings to ignore.

- Cell_4: This cell sets up the options for the statistical tests.

- Cell_5: This cell runs the statistical tests on the 'education-num' column of the adult dataset.

- Cell_6: This cell runs the statistical tests on the 'education' column of the adult dataset.

- Cell_7: This cell sets up the options for the statistical tests.

- Cell_8: This cell runs the statistical tests on the 'education' column of the adult dataset.

- Cell_9: This cell sets up the options for the statistical tests.

- Cell_10: This cell runs the statistical tests on the 'education' column of the adult dataset.

- Cell_11: This cell sets up the options for the statistical tests.

- Cell_12: This cell runs the statistical tests on the 'education' column of the adult dataset.

- Cell_13: This cell sets up the options for the statistical tests.

- Cell_14: This cell runs the statistical tests on the 'education' column of the adult dataset.

- Cell_15: This cell sets up the options for the statistical tests.

- Cell_16: This cell runs the statistical tests on the 'education' column of the adult dataset.

- Cell_17: This cell sets up the options for the statistical tests.

- Cell_18: This cell runs the statistical tests on the 'education' column
