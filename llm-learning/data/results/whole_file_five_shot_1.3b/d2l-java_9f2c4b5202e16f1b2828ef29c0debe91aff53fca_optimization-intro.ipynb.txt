    The code you've provided is for updating a chapter in a Jupyter notebook. The chapter is about optimization, and the code is for loading Maven dependencies, applying a function to an array, and creating a line plot.

    However, the code you've provided is not clear. It seems like the code is for a specific machine learning library, such as Deep Java Library (DJL), which is used for deep learning.

    The code is not clear about what the optimization is supposed to be doing. It seems like the code is trying to optimize a function, which is not clear.

    If you could provide more context or clarify what you're trying to achieve, I would be able to provide a more accurate and helpful response.
