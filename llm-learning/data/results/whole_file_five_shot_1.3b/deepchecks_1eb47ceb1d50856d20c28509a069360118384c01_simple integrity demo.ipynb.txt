```python
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

    iris_df = load_iris(return_X_y=False, as_frame=True)['frame']
    train_len = round(0.67*len(iris_df))
    df_train = iris_df[:train_len]
    df_test = iris_df[train_len:]

    from deepchecks.suites import integrity_suite

    integrity_suite().run(train_dataset=df_train, test_dataset=df_test, check_datasets_policy='both')
    ```

    The code above is used to load the iris dataset, split it into a training set and a test set, and then run a suite of checks on the datasets. The suite includes checks for data integrity, missing values, and outliers.

    The `integrity_suite().run()` function is used to run the checks. The `train_dataset` parameter is the training dataset, and the `test_dataset` parameter is the test dataset. The `check_datasets_policy` parameter is used to specify the policy for running the checks. In this case, 'both' means that the checks will be run on both the training and test datasets.

    The `deepchecks.suites` module provides a variety of suites that can be used to run checks on different types of datasets. The `integrity_suite()` function is used to get the suite for checking data integrity.

    The `run()` function of the suite is used to run the checks. The function takes as input the training and test datasets, and returns a dictionary with the results of the checks.

    The dictionary can be used to analyze the results of the checks, for example, to see if the data is missing or if there are any outliers.
