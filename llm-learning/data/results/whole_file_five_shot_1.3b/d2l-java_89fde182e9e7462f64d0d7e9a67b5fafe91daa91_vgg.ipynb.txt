The code you provided is a set of Maven dependencies for a machine learning project. The dependencies are for the AI library DJL (Deep Java Library), which is used for building and training machine learning models.

The code also includes a few cells that are used to load dependencies, define a function to create a VGG-like block of layers, and define a VGG model. The model is then trained on a dataset.

The last cell is a demonstration of how to use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

The code is not complete and does not run as is, as it requires a specific dataset and a specific model to be trained. The model is not defined in the provided code, and the dataset is not provided either.

Please provide the complete code and the specific dataset and model for the code to run successfully.
