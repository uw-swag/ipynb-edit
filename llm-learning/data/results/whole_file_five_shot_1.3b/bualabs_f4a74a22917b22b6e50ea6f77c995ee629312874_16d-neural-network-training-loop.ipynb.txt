The code you provided is a PyTorch implementation of a simple neural network for image classification. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. The code imports necessary libraries and modules.
2. It defines the URL of the MNIST dataset.
3. The `get_data` function downloads the MNIST dataset, normalizes the data, and returns the normalized data and labels.
4. The `normalize` function normalizes the input data.
5. The `Model` class is a simple neural network with one hidden layer.
6. The `loss_func` is the cross-entropy loss function.
7. The `accuracy` function calculates the accuracy of the model.
8. The code defines the batch size, learning rate, number of hidden units, and the number of epochs.
9. The code creates a model, feeds the first batch of data, calculates the loss, and updates the weights and biases.
10. The code plots the loss and accuracy over the epochs.
11. The code validates the model on a subset of the validation data.
12. The code uses the model to predict the class of the first image in the validation set, and prints the predicted class and the actual class.
13. The code uses the model to predict the class of the first image in the validation set, and prints the predicted class and the actual class.
14. The code uses the model to predict the class of the first image in the validation set, and prints the predicted class and the actual class.
15. The code uses the model to predict the class of the first image in the validation set, and prints the predicted class and the actual class.
16. The code uses the model to predict the class of the first image in the validation set, and prints the predicted class and the actual class.
17. The code uses the model to predict the class of the first image in the validation set, and prints the predicted class and the actual class.
18. The code uses the model to predict the class of the first image in the validation set, and prints the predicted class and the actual class.
19. The code uses the model to predict the class of the first image in the validation set, and prints the predicted class and the actual class.
20. The code uses the model to predict the
