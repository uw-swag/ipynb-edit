    The code you've provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses Google Cloud AutoML Operations (AutoMLOps) to create a pipeline for training a machine learning model on a BigQuery dataset and deploying it on Google Cloud AI Platform.

    The pipeline includes components for creating a dataset, training a model, and deploying the model. The components are defined in separate Python files (`create_dataset.yaml`, `train_model.yaml`, and `deploy_model.yaml`) and are used to define the pipeline.

    The pipeline parameters are defined in a dictionary, which is then passed to the `AutoMLOps.generate` function to create and run the pipeline.

    The pipeline is set to run every 12 hours using the `schedule_pattern` parameter.

    The pipeline also includes a custom training job that uses the GPUs of the AI Platform.

    Please note that the code is written in a Jupyter notebook format, and it may not work as expected if run outside of a Jupyter notebook environment.
