    The commit message "[issue-650] functionality split (#751)" suggests that the functionality of the code has been split into two separate checks. The first check, MixedDataTypes, is used to check for mixed data types in the dataframe. The second check, MixedDataTypes, is used to check for rare types in the dataframe.

    The issue number 650 is related to the functionality of the code, and the issue number 751 is related to the splitting of the functionality.

    The code is not yet complete, so the second check is not yet implemented.
