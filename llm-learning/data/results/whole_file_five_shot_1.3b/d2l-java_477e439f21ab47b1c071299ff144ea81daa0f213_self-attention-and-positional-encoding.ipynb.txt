    The commit message "Upgrade to djl 0.13.0 (#176)" is a release note for the Deep Java Library (djl). The djl is a machine learning framework for deep learning written in Java. The release includes several improvements, bug fixes, and new features.

    The code cells in the commit message are related to the upgrade of the djl to version 0.13.0. 

    The first cell loads the necessary imports and utilities for the djl. The next cell creates a new instance of the NDManager, which is a manager for NDArrays. The next cell defines the number of hidden units and the number of attention heads. The next cell creates an instance of the MultiHeadAttention class, which is a class for multi-head attention. The next cell defines the batch size and the number of queries for the attention mechanism. The next cell creates an instance of the PositionalEncoding class, which is a class for positional encoding. The next cell creates a positional encoding and a plot of it. The next cell reshapes the positional encoding and plots it. The next cell prints the binary representation of each number from 0 to 7. The next cell expands the positional encoding and plots it. The next cell gets the first element of the positional encoding and reshapes it. The next cell prints the binary representation of each element in the positional encoding.

    The last cell is a comment that explains the code.

    The commit message is a good practice for version control systems, as it provides a clear and concise description of the changes made in the code.
