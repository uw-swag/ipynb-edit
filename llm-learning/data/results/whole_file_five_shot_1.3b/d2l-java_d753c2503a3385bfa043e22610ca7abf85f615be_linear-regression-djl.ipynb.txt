    The L2 loss, also known as Mean Squared Error (MSE), is a common loss function used in regression problems. It measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. The L2 loss is the square of the difference between the actual and predicted values, and the sum of all these squared differences is averaged over all the data points.

    In the context of deep learning, the L2 loss is used as a regularization term in the loss function of a neural network. It encourages the weights of the network to be small, which helps to prevent overfitting.

    The L2 loss is calculated as the sum of the squares of the differences between the predicted and actual values. The derivative of the L2 loss with respect to the weights of the network is the sum of the differences divided by the number of data points.

    The L2 loss is used in the training of neural networks, particularly in the context of deep learning, to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of the network.

    The L2 loss is a common choice for regression problems, as it is less sensitive to outliers and can be used as a regularizer in the loss function of a neural network.

    The L2 loss is also used in the training of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to prevent the vanishing gradient problem, which is a common problem in deep learning.
