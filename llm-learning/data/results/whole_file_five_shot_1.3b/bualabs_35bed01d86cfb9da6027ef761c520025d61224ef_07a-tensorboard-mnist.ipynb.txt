```python
    import fastbook
    from fastbook import *
    from fastai.vision import *
    from fastai.callback.tensorboard import *

    # Define the data
    path = untar_data(URLs.PETS)
    df = pd.read_csv(path/'labels.csv')
    dls = ImageDataLoaders.from_df(df, path, valid_pct=0.2, seed=42)

    # Define the model
    model = cnn_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=error_rate)

    # Define the callback
    callback = TensorBoardCallback(data, learn)

    # Train the model
    model.fit_learn(1, callback)
    ```

    This code will create a TensorBoard callback and use it to train a model using the fastai library. The TensorBoard callback logs the loss and accuracy for each epoch, which can be useful for visualizing the learning process.
