    The code you provided is a Github action that uses the Deepchecks library to perform a check on a DataFrame. The check is to find mixed nulls (NaNs and None values) in the DataFrame.

    The Github action is set up to run the check on the DataFrame every time a commit is made to the repository. The check is performed using the `MixedNulls` class from the Deepchecks library.

    The `MixedNulls` class is a check that checks for mixed nulls (NaNs and None values) in a DataFrame. It returns a DataFrame with the rows that have mixed nulls.

    The `run` method of the `MixedNulls` class is used to perform the check on the DataFrame.

    The `MixedNulls` class is part of the Deepchecks library, and it's not included in the standard Deepchecks library. You need to install it separately using pip:

    ```
    pip install deepchecks
    ```

    After installing the Deepchecks library, you can use the `MixedNulls` class to perform the check on your DataFrame.
