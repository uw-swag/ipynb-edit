    The code you provided is a mix of Python code and Jupyter notebook cells. It includes loading a dataset, preprocessing it, training a model, and then using a calibration score check to evaluate the model's performance.

    Here's a brief explanation of what each section of the code does:

    1. The first section imports necessary libraries and functions. It defines a custom formatwarning function to ignore warnings, and then imports the necessary data from a UCI Machine Learning Repository.

    2. The second section downloads the adult dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and preprocesses it. It encodes categorical features and splits the data into a training set and a test set.

    3. The third section creates a pipeline that preprocesses the data, trains a RandomForestClassifier, and then uses a calibration score check to evaluate the model's performance.

    4. The fourth section uses a calibration score check to evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

    5. The fifth section loads the iris dataset, trains a Logistic Regression model, and then uses a calibration score check to evaluate the model's performance.

    6. The last section uses a calibration score check to evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

    The code is structured in a way that makes it easy to follow along with the notebook. Each section of the code is self-explanatory, and the notebook cells are used to display the results of each step.
