    The code you provided is a demonstration of how to use the `DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap` check in the DeepChecks library. This check is used to detect if there is a leakage in the training and test datasets.

    The `DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap` check compares the 'col1' field in the datasets. If the 'col1' field in the test dataset is not present in the training dataset, the check marks the test dataset as having a leakage.

    The code snippet you provided is a part of a larger pipeline that includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training. The pipeline is represented as a `Suite` object, which is a collection of datasets and checks.

    The `Suite` object is then run to execute the checks and visualize the results.

    The `run` method of the `Suite` object takes the training and test datasets as input, and returns a `Result` object. The `Result` object contains the results of the checks, and can be used to visualize the results.

    The `Result` object is then printed to the console.
