```
    # Add .gitignore and update hyperparameter_search.ipynb
    *.ipynb
    .gitignore
    ```
    The `.gitignore` file is used to specify intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. In this case, we're ignoring the Jupyter notebook file itself, as it's not a code, but a configuration file.

    The `hyperparameter_search.ipynb` file is a Jupyter notebook that uses the Hyperopt library to perform hyperparameter optimization. This notebook defines the data, model, and optimization process. The `data` function loads the MNIST dataset, reshapes it, and normalizes it. The `model` function defines a simple neural network model with two hidden layers. The `trials` object is used to store the results of the optimization process.

    The `.gitignore` file is added to the repository to ensure that the notebook is not tracked by Git.

    The `hyperparameter_search.ipynb` file is committed to the repository.
