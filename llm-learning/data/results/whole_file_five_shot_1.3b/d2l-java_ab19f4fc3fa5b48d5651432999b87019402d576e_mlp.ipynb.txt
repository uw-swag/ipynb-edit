    The code provided is a simple example of using the Deep Java Library (DJL) to perform various operations on NDArrays, such as calculating the derivative of a ReLU function, a sigmoid function, and a tanh function. The code also uses the GradientCollector to calculate the gradient of these functions.

    The code is divided into several cells, each of which performs a specific operation on an NDArray and then renders a line plot of the result. The line plot is created using the Table and LinePlot classes from the DJL.

    The code also includes a try-with-resources statement to automatically close the GradientCollector when it is no longer needed.

    The code is simplified by removing the duplicate chart, as the chart was not present in the original code.
