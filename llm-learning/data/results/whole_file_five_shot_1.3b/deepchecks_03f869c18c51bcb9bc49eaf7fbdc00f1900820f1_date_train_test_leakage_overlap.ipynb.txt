    ## Code: 0.4.0
    ## Bug: None
    ## Improvement: 
    - Added a new check `DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap` that detects when the test dataset contains data that is not present in the training dataset.
    - The `DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap` check now also provides a visualization of the data leakage.

    ## Test: 
    - The `DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap` check should now work as expected.

    ## Documentation: 
    - The `DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap` check should now be documented correctly.

    ## Code Review: 
    - The code should be reviewed for any potential improvements or new features.

    ## Dependencies: 
    - The `DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap` check depends on the `deepchecks` library.

    ## References: 
    - The `DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap` check is part of the `deepchecks` library.

    ## Status: 
    - The `DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap` check is implemented and ready for use.
