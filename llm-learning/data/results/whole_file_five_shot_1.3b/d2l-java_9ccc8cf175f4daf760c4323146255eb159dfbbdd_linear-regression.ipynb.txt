    The code you provided is already using float instead of double. The code is already using float for all variables that are not explicitly declared as double.

    Here is the updated code:

    ```java
    int n = 10000;
    NDManager manager = NDManager.newBaseManager();
    var a = manager.ones(new Shape(n));
    var b = manager.ones(new Shape(n));
    var c = manager.zeros(new Shape(n));
    StopWatch stopWatch = new StopWatch();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        c.set(new NDIndex(i), a.getFloat(i) + b.getFloat(i));
    }
    String.format("%.5f sec", stopWatch.stop());
    ```

    The code is using float for all variables that are not explicitly declared as double.
