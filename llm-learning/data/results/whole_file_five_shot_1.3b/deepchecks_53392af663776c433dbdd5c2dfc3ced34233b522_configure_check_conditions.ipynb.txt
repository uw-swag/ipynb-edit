    The code you provided is a set of Jupyter notebook cells that include a variety of operations, including importing libraries, creating datasets, running checks, and adding conditions to a suite. Here's a brief explanation of what each cell does:

    1. `<Cell_0>`: This cell imports the `DatasetsSizeComparison` check from the `deepchecks` library and adds a condition to it.

    2. `<Cell_1>`: This cell creates a dummy dataset and runs the check on the training and test datasets.

    3. `<Cell_2>`: This cell accesses a check by its id and removes a condition by its id.

    4. `<Cell_3>`: This cell re-adds a condition with new parameters.

    5. `<Cell_4>`: This cell runs a check and condition on the dummy datasets.

    6. `<Cell_5>`: This cell defines a custom condition for the `DatasetsSizeComparison` check.

    7. `<Cell_6>`: This cell creates a check instance with the custom condition and runs it on the dummy datasets.

    8. `<Cell_7>`: This cell uses a suite to run the check and condition.

    9. `<Cell_8>`: This cell defines a custom condition for the `DatasetsSizeComparison` check and creates a check instance with the custom condition and runs it on the dummy datasets.

    Please note that the code you provided is a mix of Python code and Jupyter notebook markdown cells, which is a common format for data science projects.
