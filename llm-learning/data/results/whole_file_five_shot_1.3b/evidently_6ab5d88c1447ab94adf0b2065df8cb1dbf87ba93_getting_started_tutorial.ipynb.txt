    The code you've provided is a Proof of Concept (POC) for a metric-based report generation in the evidently library. The POC demonstrates how to use the library to generate a report with a set of metrics based on a sample dataset.

    The metrics used in the POC are:

    1. DataDriftMetric: This metric measures the drift in the data distribution.
    2. ColumnSummaryMetric: This metric provides a summary of the column statistics.
    3. ColumnQuantileMetric: This metric provides the quantile of the column.
    4. ColumnDriftMetric: This metric measures the drift in the column distribution.

    The POC also demonstrates how to generate a report with these metrics. The report is then saved as a JSON file.

    The POC also includes a test suite, which is a set of tests that are run on the data. The test suite is used to check the quality of the data.
