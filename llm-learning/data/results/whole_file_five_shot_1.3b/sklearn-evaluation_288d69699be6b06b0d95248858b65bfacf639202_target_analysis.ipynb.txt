    ## Converting Notebooks to Myst Format
    ###

    #### 1. Importing Libraries

    ```python
    import matplotlib
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

    from sklearn_evaluation import plot
    from sklearn import datasets
    ```

    #### 2. Setting up Matplotlib

    ```python
    matplotlib.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = (7, 7)
    matplotlib.rcParams["font.size"] = 18
    ```

    #### 3. Generating Data

    ```python
    X, y = make_classification(
        n_samples=1000, n_features=5, n_informative=3, n_classes=2, 
        # Set label 0 for  97% and 1 for rest 3% of observations
        weights=[0.85], 
    )

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
    ```

    #### 4. Plotting Target Analysis

    ```python
    plot.target_analysis(y_train)
    plot.target_analysis(y_train, y_test)
    ```

    ## Re-organizing Sections

    The notebooks have been re-organized to follow the Myst format. The original notebooks were mostly about data analysis and visualization, but the re-organization has moved the data generation and model training sections to the top. The rest of the notebooks remain as they were.
