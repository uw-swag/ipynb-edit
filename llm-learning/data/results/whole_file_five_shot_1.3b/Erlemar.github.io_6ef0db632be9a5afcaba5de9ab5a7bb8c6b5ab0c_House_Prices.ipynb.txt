    The code you've provided is a mix of Python and Jupyter notebook code, which is a combination of Python and a markdown-like syntax. It's a mix of data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

    Here's a brief explanation of what each section of code does:

    1. `<Cell_0>` to `<Cell_1>`: This section imports the necessary libraries and modules.

    2. `<Cell_2>`: This cell reads the training data and prints the first few rows.

    3. `<Cell_3>`: This cell prints the statistical summary of the training data.

    The rest of the code is a mix of Python and Jupyter notebook code, which is a combination of Python and a markdown-like syntax. It's a mix of data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.
