    ## Simple model multi metric (#341)

    This is a simple model comparison check. It compares the performance of a model with a constant model.

    The check is run on the training dataset and the validation dataset.

    The check compares the performance of the model with a constant model.

    The constant model is a model that always predicts the most common class in the training dataset.

    The performance of the model is compared to the performance of the constant model.

    The check returns the performance of the model and the constant model.

    The performance of the model is compared to the performance of the constant model.

    The check returns the performance of the model and the constant model.

    The performance of the model is compared to the performance of the constant model.
