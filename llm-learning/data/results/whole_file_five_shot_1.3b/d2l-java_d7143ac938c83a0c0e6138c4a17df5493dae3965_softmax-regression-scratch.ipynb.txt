    The commit message "Criado usando o Colaboratory" suggests that the code is being run in a Jupyter notebook environment. This is a great way to work with Python and its libraries, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Colab.

    The commit message "Replace 10.0 snapshot with release (#91)" suggests that the version of the ai.djl library is being updated from 10.0 to 91. This could be a sign of a new release or an update to the library.

    The commit message "trainCh3" suggests that the training process is being run. This could be a function that trains a model using a given network, loss function, and update method.

    The commit message "predictCh3" suggests that the prediction process is being run. This could be a function that makes predictions on a given dataset using a given network.

    The commit message "Criado usando o Colaboratory" and "Replace 10.0 snapshot with release (#91)" are both indicative of a change in the codebase or the version of the library being used.
