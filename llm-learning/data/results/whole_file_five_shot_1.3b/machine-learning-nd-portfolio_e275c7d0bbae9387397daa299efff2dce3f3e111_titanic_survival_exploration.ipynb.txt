    The code provided is a template for an AI project. It uses the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which is a popular dataset for machine learning beginners. The project includes data exploration, data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, and model evaluation. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features such as gender, age, passenger class, sibling/spouse count, and parent/child count.

    The code also includes a function for accuracy calculation, a function for predictions based on a single feature, and a function for predictions based on multiple features. The accuracy of these predictions is evaluated using the accuracy score function.

    The project also includes visualizations to help understand the data and the model's predictions.

    The final code is a template for the entire project, and it can be customized to fit the specific requirements of the project.
