    The recommendation system is now finished. It has been trained on a dataset, and it can now make recommendations for new users or for a specific user based on their past behavior. The system uses various features of the data, such as the type of room, the price, the number of reviews, and the availability of certain amenities. The system is also able to provide insights into the most popular and expensive rooms in each neighbourhood, and the average review score for each neighbourhood.

    The final step of the system is to provide a user-friendly interface for new users to interact with the system. This can be achieved by creating a user-friendly website or an application, where users can easily input their preferences, search for rooms, and make recommendations.

    The system is also capable of handling large datasets, and it can be extended to include more features as the project progresses.
