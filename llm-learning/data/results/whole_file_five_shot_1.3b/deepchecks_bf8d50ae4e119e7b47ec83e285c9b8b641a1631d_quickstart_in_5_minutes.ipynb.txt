    The commit message "New suites (#303)" suggests a new suite of checks is being created. The suite is designed to evaluate the performance of a Random Forest model on the Iris dataset. The suite includes several checks, including integrity checks, outlier detection, and feature distribution checks. The conditions for these checks can be changed to improve the model's performance.

    However, the provided code is incomplete and does not include the actual execution of the suite. The code for running the suite would be:

    ```python
    suite.run(train_dataset=ds_train, test_dataset=ds_test, model=rf_clf)
    ```

    This would execute the suite and print the results.
