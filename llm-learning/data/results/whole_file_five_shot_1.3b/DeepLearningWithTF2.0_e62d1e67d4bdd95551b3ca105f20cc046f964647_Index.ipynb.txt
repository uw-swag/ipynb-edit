    from skimage import data
    from skimage.transform import resize

    # Load the logo
    logo = data.logo()

    # Resize the logo
    logo_resized = resize(logo, (100, 100))

    # Display the logo

    ### Response:
    The code you provided is used to display the resized logo using matplotlib. The `plt.imshow()` function is used to display an image, and `plt.show()` is used to display the plot.

    If you want to update the index of the logo, you can modify the code to do so. For example, you can add a counter to the filename of the logo. Here's an example:

    ```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    from skimage import data
    from skimage.transform import resize

    # Load the logo
    logo = data.logo()

    # Resize the logo
    logo_resized = resize(logo, (100, 100))

    # Display the logo
    plt.imshow(logo_resized)
    plt.show()

    # Update the filename
    filename = "logo_{}.png".format(i)

    # Save the logo
    plt.imsave(filename, logo_resized)
    ```

    In this code, `i` is the index of the logo. The filename is updated to include this index, and the logo is saved with this filename.
