    The code you provided is a mix of Python and Jupyter notebook cells. It's a mix of generating data, plotting data, implementing a polynomial regression model, and evaluating the model.

    Here's a brief explanation of what each part of the code does:

    1. The `generate_data` function generates data points with a polynomial model. The coefficients of the polynomial are given in the `theta` list.

    2. The `plot_data` function plots the data points.

    3. The `predict` function computes the predicted values based on the given coefficients and data points.

    4. The `polynomial_regression` function implements the polynomial regression model.

    5. The `compute_MSE` function computes the mean squared error.

    6. The `kf.split(X)` function splits the data into training and evaluation subsets.

    7. The `MSE` list stores the mean squared error for different polynomial orders.

    8. The `plt.plot` function plots the mean squared error for different polynomial orders.

    9. The `X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2)` line splits the data into a training set and a test set.

    10. The `theta_hat` is the estimated coefficients of the polynomial regression model.

    11. The `plot_data` function plots the training and test data points.

    12. The `plot_data` function plots the regression lines.

    13. The `Y_hat = predict(X_test, theta_hat)` line computes the predicted values.

    14. The `TSS, RSS, Rs` variables are computed to evaluate the model.
