    The code snippet you provided skips SSL verification for the bike dataset in the examples. This is done by setting the `verify` parameter to `False` when making the `requests.get()` call.

    However, it's important to note that this is not a best practice. Verifying SSL certificates is a security measure to ensure that the server you're connecting to is the one you expect. It's generally recommended to use HTTPS instead of HTTP, and to verify the SSL certificate when you're making requests.

    If you're using this code in a production environment, you should always verify the SSL certificate. This can be done by setting the `verify` parameter to `True`, and specifying the path to a CA bundle.

    Here's how you can modify the code to skip SSL verification:

    ```python
    requests.get("https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/275/bike+sharing+dataset.zip", verify=False)
    ```

    This will make the request without verifying the SSL certificate, which can be useful in development environments where you don't have a trusted certificate.

    However, in a production environment, it's generally recommended to verify the SSL certificate.
