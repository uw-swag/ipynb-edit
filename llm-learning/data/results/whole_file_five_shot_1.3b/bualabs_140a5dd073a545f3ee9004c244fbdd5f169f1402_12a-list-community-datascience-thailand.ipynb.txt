```python
    import pandas as pd
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    import requests

    # URL of the page to be scraped
    url = 'https://www.facebook.com/groups/<group_name>/'

    # Send HTTP request
    response = requests.get(url)

    # Parse the HTML content of the page with BeautifulSoup
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

    # Find all the links in the HTML
    links = [a['href'] for a in soup.find_all('a', href=True)]

    # Create a DataFrame from the links
    df = pd.DataFrame(links, columns=['Links'])

    # Check the DataFrame
    print(df)
    ```
    This script will scrape the Facebook group links from the provided URL. The links are then stored in a DataFrame.

    Please replace `<group_name>` with the actual name of the Facebook group you want to scrape.

    Note: This script requires the BeautifulSoup and requests libraries. You can install them using pip:
    ```
    pip install beautifulsoup4
    pip install requests
    ```

    Also, please be aware that scraping Facebook may violate their terms of service, and it's important to respect the site's robots.txt file.
