    This notebook contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras, as well as the utilities for plotting and visualizing the outputs. The notebook also includes the process of converting the trained model to TensorFlow Lite format, and the process of downloading the converted model and labels.

    The notebook also includes a section for visualizing the test images and a zip file containing the test images.

    The notebook is designed to be run in a Jupyter notebook environment.

    The notebook is divided into several sections, each of which contains a set of cells. The first cell is a cell for setting up the environment, the last cell is a cell for downloading the converted model and labels.

    The notebook also includes a section for visualizing the outputs, which is a set of cells that display the output of the model.

    The notebook also includes a section for downloading the test images, which is a set of cells that download the test images.
