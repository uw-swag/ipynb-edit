The code you provided is updating the properties of a dataset in a machine learning workflow. Here's a brief explanation of what's happening:

1. The code first imports necessary libraries and loads a dataset from sklearn's datasets.

2. It then splits the dataset into a training set and a test set.

3. The training set is passed to a GradientBoostingRegressor model, which is a type of machine learning model used for regression tasks.

4. The model is then trained on the training set.

5. The test set is passed to the trained model to make predictions.

6. The code then creates a check for RegressionErrorDistribution, which is a DeepChecks check that calculates the distribution of regression error.

7. The check is run on the test set to see how well the model is performing.

8. The code then changes the target value in the test set to 150, and re-runs the check to see how the model performs with the new target value.

Please note that the code provided is a simple example and may not work as expected in a real-world scenario. The code is using a simple dataset and a model, but in a real-world scenario, you would likely need to use a more complex dataset and a more complex model.
