    The commit message "bump of D2L Java book version to 0.8.0 (#58)" is a request to bump the version of the D2L Java book to 0.8.0. This is a major version upgrade, which means that the book has been significantly rewritten and expanded.

    The code cells provided are part of a larger project that involves the use of the D2L Java book. The project includes loading various Maven dependencies, loading Java source files, defining functions, and implementing a simple gradient descent algorithm.

    The `%maven` commands are used to add Maven dependencies to the project. The `%maven ai.djl:api:0.7.0-SNAPSHOT` command adds the `ai.djl:api` dependency with the version `0.7.0-SNAPSHOT`.

    The `%maven org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.26` and `%maven org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:1.7.26` commands add the `org.slf4j:slf4j-api` and `org.slf4j:slf4j-simple` dependencies with the versions `1.7.26`.

    The `%maven ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-engine:0.7.0-SNAPSHOT` and `%maven ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-native-auto:1.7.0-b` commands add the `ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-engine` and `ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-native-auto` dependencies with the versions `0.7.0-SNAPSHOT`.

    The `import ai.djl.ndarray.*;`, `import ai.djl.ndarray.types.*;`, and `import ai.djl.Device;` lines are used to import necessary classes from the `ai.djl` package.

    The `NDManager manager = NDManager.newBaseManager();` line creates a new instance of the `NDManager` class.

    The `getRandomNormal(
