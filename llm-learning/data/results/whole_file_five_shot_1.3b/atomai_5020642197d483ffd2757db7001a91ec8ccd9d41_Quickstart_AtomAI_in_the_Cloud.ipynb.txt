    # List of examples
    # Each example is a Python code block that includes the commit message, original code cells, and the expected output.
    # The output is the result of running the code block.

    # Example 1:
    # Commit Message: "Adding a function to calculate the factorial of a number"
    # Original Code Cells:
    '''
    def factorial(n):
        if n == 0:
            return 1
        else:
            return n * factorial(n-1)
    '''
    # Expected Output: 120

    # Example 2:
    # Commit Message: "Sorting a list of numbers"
    # Original Code Cells:
    '''
    def bubble_sort(numbers):
        for i in range(len(numbers)):
            for j in range(len(numbers) - 1):
                if numbers[j] > numbers[j + 1]:
                    numbers[j], numbers[j + 1] = numbers[j + 1], numbers[j]
        return numbers
    '''
    # Expected Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

    # Example 3:
    # Commit Message: "Finding the largest number in a list"
    # Original Code Cells:
    '''
    def find_largest_number(numbers):
        return max(numbers)
    '''
    # Expected Output: 10

    # Example 4:
    # Commit Message: "Finding the smallest number in a list"
    # Original Code Cells:
    '''
    def find_smallest_number(numbers):
        return min(numbers)
    '''
    # Expected Output: 1

    # Example 5:
    # Commit Message: "Adding two numbers"
    # Original Code Cells:
    '''
    def add_two_numbers(num1, num2):
        return num1 + num2
    '''
    # Expected Output: 11
