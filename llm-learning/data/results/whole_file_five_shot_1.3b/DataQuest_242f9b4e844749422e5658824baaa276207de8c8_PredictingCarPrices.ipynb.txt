    The code you've provided is a guided project on predicting car prices using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The project includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

    The project starts by importing necessary libraries and loading a dataset. The dataset is then cleaned by replacing missing values with NaN and converting the data type to float.

    The project then normalizes the data by scaling the features to a range between 0 and 1.

    The project then trains a KNN model for each feature in the dataset. The model's performance is evaluated using the mean squared error (RMSE) as a metric.

    The project then visualizes the performance of the models by plotting the RMSE values against the number of features used.

    The project also includes a function to optimize the hyperparameter (k) for the best model.

    The project concludes by ranking the training features by their minimum RMSE values and using these to train and evaluate a multivariate KNN model.
