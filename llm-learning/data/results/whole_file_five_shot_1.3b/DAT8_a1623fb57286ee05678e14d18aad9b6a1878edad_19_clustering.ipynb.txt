    The code you provided is a series of operations on a dataset of beer reviews. Here's a brief overview of what each section of code does:

    1. **Import necessary libraries and load the beer dataset**: This code imports the necessary libraries and loads the beer dataset from a URL.

    2. **Define X**: This code defines X as all columns of the beer dataset except 'name'.

    3. **K-means clustering**: This code applies K-means clustering to the data. The number of clusters is set to 3.

    4. **Review the cluster labels**: This code reviews the cluster labels assigned by the K-means algorithm.

    5. **Save the cluster labels and sort by cluster**: This code saves the cluster labels in the beer DataFrame and sorts it by cluster.

    6. **Review the cluster centers**: This code reviews the cluster centers, which are the centroids of the clusters.

    7. **Calculate the mean of each feature for each cluster**: This code calculates the mean of each feature for each cluster.

    8. **Save the DataFrame of cluster centers**: This code saves the DataFrame of cluster centers.

    9. **Create a "colors" array for plotting**: This code creates a colors array for plotting.

    10. **Scatter plot of calories versus alcohol, colored by cluster**: This code creates a scatter plot of calories versus alcohol, colored by cluster.

    11. **Scatter plot matrix**: This code creates a scatter plot matrix of the scaled data.

    12. **Center and scale the data**: This code centers and scales the data.

    13. **K-means clustering on scaled data**: This code applies K-means clustering to the scaled data.

    14. **Save the cluster labels and sort by cluster**: This code saves the cluster labels in the beer DataFrame and sorts it by cluster.

    15. **Review the cluster centers**: This code reviews the cluster centers.

    16. **Scatter plot matrix of new cluster assignments**: This code creates a scatter plot matrix of the new cluster assignments.

    17. **Calculate Silhouette Score**: This code calculates
