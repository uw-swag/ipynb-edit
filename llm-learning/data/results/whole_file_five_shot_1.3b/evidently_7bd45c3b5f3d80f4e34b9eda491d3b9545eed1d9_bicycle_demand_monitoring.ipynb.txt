```python
    import streamlit as st

    def main():
        st.title("My First Streamlit App")

        st.write("This is a simple app to get started with Streamlit.")

        st.write("What's an app?")
        st.write("An app is a software application that can be used to create and share data visualizations, weather forecasts, and much more.")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```
    This is a simple Streamlit app. It displays a title, a write statement, and a write statement about Streamlit.

    To run this app, you need to install Streamlit first. You can install it using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install streamlit
    ```

    Then, you can run the app using the following command:

    ```bash
    streamlit run your_file.py
    ```

    Replace "your_file.py" with the name of your Python file.

    This is a basic example. Streamlit can be used to create more complex dashboards, including interactive plots, maps, and more.

    For more information, check out the [official Streamlit documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/).
