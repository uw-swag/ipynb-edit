    The commit message "Upgrade to djl 0.13.0 (#176)" is a request to upgrade the version of the AI DL library to 0.13.0. The changes in this version include the introduction of new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

    The code cells are as follows:

    - `<Cell_0>`: This cell is for setting up the Maven repository and dependencies.
    - `<Cell_1>`: This cell is for importing the necessary classes.
    - `<Cell_2>`: This cell is for defining a function that returns a new NDArray with zeros.
    - `<Cell_3>`: This cell is for testing the `sampler` function.
    - `<Cell_4>`: This cell is for defining a class `Function` with a static method `logExp`.
    - `<Cell_5>`: This cell is for testing the `grad` function.

    The `grad` function is a placeholder for the actual implementation of the gradient calculation.

    The `stableLogExp` function is a placeholder for the actual implementation of the `stableLogExp` function.

    The `<Cell_6>` and `<Cell_7>` cells are for testing the `grad` function with different inputs.

    The `<Cell_8>` and `<Cell_9>` cells are for testing the `stableLogExp` function.

    The `<Cell_10>` cell is for testing the `grad` function with different inputs.

    The `<Cell_11>` cell is for testing the `stableLogExp` function.

    The `<Cell_12>` cell is for testing the `grad` function with different inputs.

    The `<Cell_13>` cell is for testing the `stableLogExp` function.

    The `<Cell_14>` cell is for testing the `grad` function with different inputs.

    The `<Cell_15>` cell is for testing the `stableLogExp` function.

    The `<Cell_16>` cell is for testing the `grad` function with different inputs.

    The `<Cell_17>` cell is for testing the `stableLogExp` function
