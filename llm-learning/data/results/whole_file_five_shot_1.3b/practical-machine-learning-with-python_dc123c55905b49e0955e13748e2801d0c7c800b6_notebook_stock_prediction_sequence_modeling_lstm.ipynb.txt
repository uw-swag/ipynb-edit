    The code you provided is a demonstration of how to use LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to predict stock prices. The code is divided into several steps, including data retrieval, data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

    The first part of the code is importing necessary libraries and modules. The `get_raw_data` function is used to retrieve stock data from Yahoo Finance, and the `get_seq_model` function is used to build an LSTM model.

    The next part of the code is setting up the training parameters and data. The `get_seq_train_test` function is used to split the data into a training set and a test set.

    The next part of the code is plotting the original data and the training data.

    The next part of the code is building the LSTM model and training it. The model is then trained and evaluated.

    The last part of the code is plotting the true data, the training data, and the forecasted data.

    The code also includes a line to plot the true and forecasted values, which can be used to visualize the performance of the model.

    The code is not removing the Git Large File Storage (LFS) as it is not necessary for this demonstration. LFS is a tool that allows Git to manage large files in a more efficient way. It is not used in this code.

    The code is also not removing the `.gitignore` file as it is not necessary for this demonstration. The `.gitignore` file is used to specify intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

    The code is not removing the `.DS_Store` file as it is not necessary for this demonstration. The `.DS_Store` file is a hidden file that macOS creates when you create a new folder.

    The code is not removing the `README.md` file as it is not necessary for this demonstration. The `README.md` file is a markdown file that provides a brief description of the code.

    The code is not removing the `LICENSE` file as it is not necessary for this demonstration. The `LICENSE` file is a text file that contains the license information for the code.

    The code is not removing the `.ipynb` file as it is not necessary
