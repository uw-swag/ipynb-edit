    for name, model in models:
        scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)
        print(f"{name} Accuracy: {scores.mean()} ({scores.std()})")
    ```
    This script will compare the performance of different machine learning models on the same dataset. The `cross_val_score` function is used to perform 5-fold cross-validation on the dataset. The mean accuracy and standard deviation of the scores are then printed for each model.
