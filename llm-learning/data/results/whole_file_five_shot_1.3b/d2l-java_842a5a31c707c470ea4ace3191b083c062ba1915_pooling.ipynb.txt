    # ---------------------------
    # This section covers the use of the `.get_pynblint_results()` method in the Notebook class.

    # The `.get_pynblint_results()` method returns a dictionary containing the results of the linting process for the notebook.

    # The dictionary keys are the linting rules that were applied, and the values are the results of the linting for each rule.

    # For example, if the notebook has a rule that checks for the presence of a cell with a specific title, the `.get_pynblint_results()` method will return a dictionary that looks like this:

    # {
    #   'CellTitle': {
    #       'status': 'PASS',
    #       'message': 'Cell title is present'
    #   },
    #   ...
    # }

    # The `.get_pynblint_results()` method also returns a dictionary that contains the results of the linting process for the entire notebook, which is a combination of the results of the linting for each individual cell.
