    The code you provided is a mix of Jupyter notebook cells and Python code. It includes several sections, each of which is a cell in the notebook. Here's a brief explanation of what each section does:

1. **Cell 0-3:** These cells are for displaying HTML content. The function `dhtml` is used to display HTML content in a Jupyter notebook cell. The function `phtml` is used to display HTML content in a Python cell.

2. **Cell 4-7:** These cells are for data processing. The function `preprocess` is used to preprocess the data. The function `train_input_fn` and `test_input_fn` are used to create input functions for training and testing the model.

3. **Cell 8-11:** These cells are for displaying the keys of a batch of data. The function `display_predict` is used to display the keys of a batch of data.

4. **Cell 12-15:** These cells are for training a DNN classifier on the MNIST dataset. The DNN classifier is trained using the `train_input_fn` function. The test results are displayed using the `phtml` function.

5. **Cell 16-17:** These cells are for displaying the predictions made by the DNN classifier. The function `display_predict` is used to display the predictions.

6. **Cell 18:** This cell is for displaying the keys of a batch of data.

7. **Cell 19:** This cell is for displaying the keys of a batch of data.

8. **Cell 20:** This cell is for displaying the keys of a batch of data.

9. **Cell 21:** This cell is for displaying the keys of a batch of data.

10. **Cell 22:** This cell is for displaying the keys of a batch of data.

11. **Cell 23:** This cell is for displaying the keys of a batch of data.

12. **Cell 24:** This cell is for displaying the keys of a batch of data.

13. **Cell 25:** This cell is for displaying the keys of
