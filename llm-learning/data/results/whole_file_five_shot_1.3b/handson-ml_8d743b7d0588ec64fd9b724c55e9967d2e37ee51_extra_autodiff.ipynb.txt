    ### Automatic Differentiation (Autodiff)

    Autodiff is a powerful technique used in machine learning and deep learning to compute gradients. It's a way to compute the derivative of a function with respect to its input.

    In this notebook, we'll be focusing on the basics of Autodiff. We'll start with a simple example of how to compute the derivative of a function with respect to its input using Autodiff.

    We'll then move on to a more complex example, where we'll use Autodiff to optimize a function.

    Finally, we'll discuss the benefits of using Autodiff and how it can be used in various machine learning and deep learning applications.

    ### Example of a simple function with Autodiff

    Let's start with a simple function:

    ```python
    def f(x):
        return x**2
    ```

    We can compute the derivative of this function with respect to its input using Autodiff.

    Here's how we can do it:

    ```python
    import autograd.numpy as np
    from autograd import grad

    f = lambda x: x**2
    grad_f = grad(f)

    x = np.array(1.0)
    print(grad_f(x))  # Output: 2.0
    ```

    In this example, we first define the function `f` and then use the `grad` function from the `autograd` library to compute the derivative of `f` with respect to its input.

    ### Example of using Autodiff to optimize a function

    Now, let's move on to a more complex example. We'll use Autodiff to optimize a function.

    For example, we can use Autodiff to find the minimum of a function. Here's how we can do it:

    ```python
    import autograd.numpy as np
    from autograd import grad

    f = lambda x: x**2
    grad_f = grad(f)

    x = 0.0
