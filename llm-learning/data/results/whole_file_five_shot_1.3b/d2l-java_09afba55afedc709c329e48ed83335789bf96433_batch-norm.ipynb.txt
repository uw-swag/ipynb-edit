    The code you provided is a complete notebook that includes all the necessary dependencies and code cells. It's a good example of how to use the AI DJL library to train a model for image classification using the MNIST dataset.

    The notebook includes:

    - Importing necessary libraries and dependencies.
    - Loading the MNIST dataset.
    - Defining a function to perform batch normalization.
    - Defining a class for a batch normalization block.
    - Creating a sequential model with convolutional layers and batch normalization layers.
    - Training the model for a number of epochs.
    - Evaluating the model's performance.
    - Plotting the training and test loss and accuracy.
    - Printing the value of gamma and beta in the first BatchNorm layer.

    This notebook is a good starting point for anyone interested in using AI DJL for image classification.
