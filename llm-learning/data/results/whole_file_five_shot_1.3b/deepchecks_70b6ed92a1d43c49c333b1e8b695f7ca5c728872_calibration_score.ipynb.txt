    The code you provided is a mix of Python and Jupyter notebook cells. Here's a brief explanation of what each cell does:

    1. `<Cell_0>`: This cell imports necessary libraries and functions. It also defines a custom function `custom_formatwarning` to ignore warnings.

    2. `<Cell_1>`: This cell downloads the adult dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository and preprocesses it. It also encodes categorical features and splits the data into training and testing sets.

    3. `<Cell_2>`: This cell creates a `Dataset` object for the training and testing data. It also defines the categorical features.

    4. `<Cell_3>`: This cell creates a pipeline for preprocessing the data, including filling missing values and encoding categorical features. It then fits the model to the training data.

    5. `<Cell_4>`: This cell uses the `CalibrationScore` check to evaluate the model's calibration.

    6. `<Cell_5>`: This cell loads the iris dataset from sklearn and trains a logistic regression model. It then creates a `Dataset` object for the test data and uses the model to evaluate the calibration.

    7. `<Cell_6>`: This cell uses the `CalibrationScore` check to evaluate the logistic regression model's calibration.

    The code is a mix of Python and Jupyter notebook cells, and it seems to be a part of a larger project or script.
