    ## How to use

    ### Code
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    np.random.seed(22)

    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

    # Load Data
    iris_df = load_iris(return_X_y=False, as_frame=True)['frame']
    label_col = 'target'
    df_train, df_test = train_test_split(iris_df, stratify=iris_df[label_col], random_state=0)

    # Train Model
    rf_clf = RandomForestClassifier()
    rf_clf.fit(df_train.drop(label_col, axis=1), df_train[label_col]);
    ```

    ### Explanation

    This code is a simple example of how to use the DeepChecks library to perform some basic data quality checks on a dataset. The dataset is loaded from the sklearn.datasets module, and a RandomForestClassifier is trained on it. The trained model is then used to make predictions on the test dataset.

    The DeepChecks library provides a suite of checks that can be run on the data. In this case, we're using the full suite, which includes a wide range of checks for different types of data.

    The suite is run on the training dataset and the test dataset, and the results are printed.

    ## How to install

    To install DeepChecks, you can use pip:

    ```
    pip install deepchecks
    ```

    ## How to run

    To run the code, you can copy it into a Python script and run it.

    ## How to contribute

    Contributions to DeepChecks are welcome. If you have a feature you'd like to add, or if you'd like to fix a bug, please open an issue on the DeepChecks GitHub repository.
