```python
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    from deepchecks.checks.methodology import *
    from deepchecks.base import Dataset

    np.random.seed(42)
    df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(100, 3), columns=['x1', 'x2', 'x3'])
    df['x4'] = df['x1'] * 0.05 + df['x2']
    df['x5'] = df['x2']*121 + 0.01 * df['x1']
    df['label'] = df['x5'].apply(lambda x: 0 if x < 0 else 1)

    dataset = Dataset(df, label='label', index_name='x1', datetime_name='x2')

    IdentifierLeakage().run(dataset)

    my_check = IdentifierLeakage(ppscore_params={'sample': 10})
    my_check.run(dataset=dataset)
    ```

    The code above is a simple example of how to use the `IdentifierLeakage` check in DeepChecks. This check is used to detect when the same identifier is used for different features in the dataset.

    The `run` method of the `IdentifierLeakage` check is used to execute the check on the given dataset. The `ppscore_params` parameter is a dictionary that specifies the parameters for the `ppscore` method, which is used to calculate the PP-score.

    The PP-score is a measure of the similarity between two sets of data. The PP-score is defined as the proportion of shared data points among the total number of data points.

    The `run` method returns a `CheckResult` object, which contains the results of the check. You can use this object to further analyze the results of the check.

    Please note that you need to have the DeepChecks library installed in your environment to run this code. You can install it using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install deepchecks
    ```
