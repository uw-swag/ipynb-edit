    The commit message "Upgrade to djl 0.13.0 (#176)" indicates a major version upgrade of the Deep Java Library (djl). The djl is a machine learning library for Java that provides a high-level API for building and training machine learning models. 

    The version 0.13.0 of the djl includes several improvements and new features. These include:

    1. Improved support for different types of datasets, including image classification datasets.
    2. Added support for more complex architectures, including the use of parallel blocks in the inception block.
    3. Improved support for model evaluation metrics, including accuracy and other common metrics.
    4. Added support for more complex training configurations, including learning rate scheduling and model checkpointing.
    5. Improved support for distributed training, including support for multiple GPUs and distributed training on multiple machines.

    The djl is a significant update for anyone working with machine learning in Java, as it provides a more robust and flexible API for building and training models.
