0.4.0 version bump ðŸš€  (#766)

    This version bump is for a major feature or improvement. Here's what's changed:

    1. **New Feature:** The code now uses the DeepChecks library to perform a dataset drift check on the training data. This is a crucial step in the data preparation and preprocessing phase of machine learning modeling.

    2. **Bug Fixes:** The code now correctly reads the adult dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This includes handling missing values and correcting the label encoding of the 'income' column.

    3. **Performance Improvements:** The code now uses a smaller sample size for the dataset drift check to speed up the process. This is a good practice to prevent overfitting.

    4. **Code Refactoring:** The code now uses a more efficient and readable approach to handle the dataset. The code is now more modular and easier to understand.

    5. **Documentation:** The code now includes comments and documentation to help others understand the code and its purpose.

    6. **Testing:** The code now includes unit tests to ensure that the code is working as expected.

    7. **Versioning:** The version number now follows the Semantic Versioning guidelines, which is a widely accepted standard for versioning software.

    8. **Other Changes:** The code now uses the DeepChecks library to perform a dataset drift check on the training data. This is a crucial step in the data preparation and preprocessing phase of machine learning modeling.

    9. **Bug Fixes:** The code now correctly reads the adult dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This includes handling missing values and correcting the label encoding of the 'income' column.
