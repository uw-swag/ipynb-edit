    This code is used to test the models for various questions related to natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). The models are BERT models, which are pre-trained on a large corpus of text, and are used for various NLP tasks such as masked language modeling, next sentence prediction, etc.

    The code starts by importing necessary libraries and defining a directory path for the models. It then loads the BERT models and tokenizers using the models and tokenizers from the transformers library.

    The code then defines a dictionary of questions, each with a sentence, an answer, and a list of distractors. The code then iterates over the questions, and for each question, it uses the BERT models to generate candidate answers. It also checks if the generated answer is in the list of distractors.

    Finally, the code prints the number of distractors in the generated answers, and the index of the generated answer in the list of distractors.

    The code also includes a section to check if the answer is in the generated answers. If it is, it prints the number of distractors in the generated answers, and the index of the answer in the list of distractors.
