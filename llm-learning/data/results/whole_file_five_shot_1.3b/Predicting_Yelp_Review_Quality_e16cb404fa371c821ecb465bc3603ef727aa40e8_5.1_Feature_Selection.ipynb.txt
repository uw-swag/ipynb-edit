    The code you've provided is a complete pipeline for training a logistic regression model on a dataset. It includes data loading, preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

    The model is then saved for future use. The pipeline also includes permutation importance and mutual information calculation, which can be useful for understanding the importance of different features in the model.

    The code also includes a function to display the values on the bars in a bar plot.

    The final part of the code is a permutation importance plot, which shows the importance of each feature in the model.

    Please note that the code is written in Python and uses several libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, and pickle.
