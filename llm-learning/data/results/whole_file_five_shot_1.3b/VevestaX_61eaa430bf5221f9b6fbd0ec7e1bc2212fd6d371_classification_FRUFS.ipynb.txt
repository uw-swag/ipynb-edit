    ## Tutorial for Classification and Feature Selection by FRUPS

    ### Introduction

    Feature selection and classification are critical steps in the machine learning process. In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of classification and feature selection using the FRUPS (Feature Ranking Under the Pairwise Selection Strategy) algorithm.

    ### Prerequisites

    Before we start, you should have a basic understanding of machine learning and programming. You should also have a dataset that you are working with.

    ### What is FRUPS?

    FRUPS is a feature selection method that ranks features based on their importance in a model. It uses a pairwise selection strategy to rank features. The pairwise selection strategy ranks features based on their correlation with the target variable. The correlation is calculated using a method called Pearson correlation.

    ### Classification with FRUPS

    Let's assume we have a dataset `df` with features `X` and target `y`. We can use the FRUPS algorithm to classify the data.

    ```python
    from sklearn.feature_selection import FRUPS

    # Initialize the FRUPS algorithm
    frups = FRUPS(n_features_to_select=10)

    # Fit the algorithm to the data
    frups.fit(X, y)

    # Get the selected features
    selected_features = frups.support_

    # Get the ranking of the features
    ranking = frups.ranking_
    ```

    ### Feature Selection with FRUPS

    FRUPS can also be used for feature selection. Let's say we have a dataset `df` with features `X` and target `y`. We can use the FRUPS algorithm to select the features.

    ```python
    from sklearn.feature_selection import FRUPS

    # Initialize the FRUPS algorithm
    frups = FRUPS(n_features_to_select=10, mode='s')

    # Fit the algorithm to the data
    frups.fit(X, y)

    # Get the selected features
    selected_features = X.columns[frups.support_
