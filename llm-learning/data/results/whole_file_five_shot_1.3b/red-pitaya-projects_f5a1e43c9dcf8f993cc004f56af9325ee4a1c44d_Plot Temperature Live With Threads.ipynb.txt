The code you've provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the matplotlib library to create a live plot of temperature data collected from a microcontroller. The notebook includes a function to collect data from a temperature sensor, a thread to collect data in the background, and a function to animate the plot with the collected data.

The code is divided into several cells, each of which performs a specific task. The first cell imports the necessary libraries and sets up the data file name. The second cell reads the data from the file into a pandas DataFrame, and if the file does not exist, it creates an empty DataFrame. The third cell starts a thread to collect data in the background. The fourth cell sets a global variable to stop the thread when it is no longer needed. The fifth cell displays the DataFrame. The sixth cell writes the DataFrame back to a file. The seventh cell reads the DataFrame from the file into a pandas DataFrame, and then plots the data. The eighth cell starts an animation of the plot with the collected data. The ninth cell clears the plot and redraws the plot with the latest data. The tenth cell writes the DataFrame back to a file. The eleventh cell displays the DataFrame.

The code is designed to run in a Jupyter notebook environment, and it uses the matplotlib library to create the live plot. The code also uses the pandas library to handle the data, and it uses the threading library to collect data in the background.
