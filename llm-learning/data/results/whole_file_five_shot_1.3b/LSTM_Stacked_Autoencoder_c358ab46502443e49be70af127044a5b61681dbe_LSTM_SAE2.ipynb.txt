    The code you provided is a TensorFlow-based implementation of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder for denoising the gold price. The LSTM autoencoder is used to denoise the price data by learning to reconstruct the original data from the noisy data. The model is trained for 500 epochs and the mean absolute error (MAE) is calculated for each epoch. The MAE is then averaged over all epochs to get the final MAE. The denoised price is also plotted against the original price.

    However, the code you provided is incomplete and does not include the part where the model is trained and the MAE is calculated. The part where the model is trained and the MAE is calculated is not included in the provided code.

    If you want to train the model and calculate the MAE, you need to add the training part to the code.
