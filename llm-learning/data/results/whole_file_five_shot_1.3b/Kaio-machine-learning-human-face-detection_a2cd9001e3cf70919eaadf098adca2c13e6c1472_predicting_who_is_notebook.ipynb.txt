    This is a Jupyter notebook that uses scikit-learn to explore the relationship between different features in the dataset. The features used are 'blink_left', 'blink_right', 'smile_or_not', 'rate_smile_or_not', 'rate_blink_left', 'rate_blink_right'. The notebook then plots these features against the 'user' feature.

    The notebook also includes a function 'evaluate' that uses the 'rate_smile_or_not', 'rate_blink_left', and 'rate_blink_right' features to predict the 'user' feature.

    The 'evaluate' function is not included in the original code, but it is a function that you can use to evaluate the performance of your model.

    The 'get_full_data' function is not included in the original code, but it is a function that you can use to load the full dataset.

    The 'show_relationship' function is not included in the original code, but it is a function that you can use to plot the relationship between two features.

    The 'rate_smile_or_not', 'rate_blink_left', and 'rate_blink_right' features are not included in the original code, but they are features that you can use to evaluate the performance of your model.

    The 'user' feature is not included in the original code, but it is a feature that you can use to evaluate the performance of your model.

    The 'predicting_who_is' module is not included in the original code, but it is a module that you can use to evaluate the performance of your model.

    The 'data' module is not included in the original code, but it is a module that you can use to load the data.

    The 'sklearn' module is not included in the original code, but it is a module that you can use to evaluate the performance of your model.

    The 'matplotlib' module is not included in the original code, but it is a module that you can use to plot the data.

    The 'seaborn' module is not included in the original code, but it is a module that you can use to plot the data.
