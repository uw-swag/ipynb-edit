    The commit message "Replace 10.0 snapshot with release" is suggesting that the version of the library or package is being updated from a snapshot to a release version. This is a good practice as it allows for the smooth transition from a developmental version to a stable one.

    In the provided code, the version number `0.10.0-SNAPSHOT` is used for the libraries `ai.djl:api`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-api`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-simple`, `ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-engine`, and `ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-native-auto`. These are the versions of the libraries that are being used in the code.

    The `%mavenRepo snapshots https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/` command is used to specify the Maven repository for the snapshots. This means that the versions of the libraries are stored in a separate repository, which is not the default behavior.

    The `%maven` commands are used to add dependencies to the project. The `%mavenRepo` command is used to specify the repository for the dependencies, and the `%maven` command is used to add the actual dependencies to the project.

    The `NDManager` class is used to handle numerical data, and the `NDArray` class is used to represent numerical data in a numeric format. The `NDIndex` class is used to specify the indexing of the data.

    The `plot` function is used to create a scatter plot of the data. The `ScatterTrace` class is used to create the trace of the plot, and the `Layout` class is used to create the layout of the plot.

    The `getNet` function is used to create a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) network. The `SequentialBlock` class is used to create a sequence of blocks, and the `Model` class is used to create a model.

    The `train` function is used to train the model. The `DefaultTrainingConfig` class is used to create the configuration of the training, and the `Trainer` class is used to create a trainer.
