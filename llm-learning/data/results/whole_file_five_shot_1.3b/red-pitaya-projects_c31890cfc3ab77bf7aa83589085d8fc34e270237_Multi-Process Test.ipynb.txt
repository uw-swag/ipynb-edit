```python
    from multiprocessing import Pool

    def f(x):
        return x*x

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        with Pool(5) as p:
            print(p.map(f, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
    ```

    This code will create a pool of 5 workers and use them to apply the function `f` to the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The result will be printed out.

    Please note that this is a simple example and real-world usage may require more complex setup and handling.
