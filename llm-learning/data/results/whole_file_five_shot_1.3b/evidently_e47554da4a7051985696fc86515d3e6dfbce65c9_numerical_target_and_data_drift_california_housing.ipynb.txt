    The code you've provided is a set of examples for using the evidently library to analyze and visualize data drift and model performance. 

    Here's a brief explanation of what each code snippet does:

    1. Import necessary libraries and modules.
    2. Fetch the California housing dataset and create a dataframe.
    3. Define the target variable and the numerical and categorical features.
    4. Create a column mapping object to map the target variable to the numerical features.
    5. Sample a subset of the data for reference and production data.
    6. Create a dashboard for target drift and data drift.
    7. Calculate the metrics for target drift and data drift and display the dashboard.
    8. Create a profile for target drift and data drift and calculate the metrics.
    9. Export the JSON output of the profile.

    The dashboard and profile are used to visualize the data drift and model performance. The dashboard provides a summary of the data drift and model performance, while the profile provides a detailed report of the data drift and model performance.

    The code also includes examples of how to generate test generators for how_to_questions. This is not included in the provided code snippet, as it's a more complex topic and beyond the scope of this example.

    Please note that the provided code snippets are just examples and may not work as expected. You may need to adjust them according to your specific needs and the version of the evidently library you're using.
