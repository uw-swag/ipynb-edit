    ### 4.1: Data Cleaning

    ## 4.1.1: Handling Missing Values

    The dataset does not contain any missing values. However, it's always a good practice to check for missing values before any preprocessing. You can use the `isnull()` function in pandas to check for missing values.

    ```python
    Revised_Matches_df.isnull().sum()
    ```

    ## 4.1.2: Handling Categorical Variables

    Categorical variables are variables that have a fixed set of possible values. In the dataset, there are no categorical variables.

    ## 4.1.3: Handling Numerical Variables

    Numerical variables are variables that contain a quantitative measurement. In the dataset, there are no numerical variables.

    ## 4.1.4: Binning

    Binning is the process of dividing the data into different groups or ranges. In the dataset, there are no binning operations.

    ## 4.1.5: Encoding Categorical Variables

    Encoding is the process of converting categorical variables into a format that can be used by machine learning algorithms. In the dataset, there are no categorical variables to encode.

    ## 4.1.6: Normalization

    Normalization is the process of scaling the values of a numeric column to a specific range, often between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. In the dataset, there are no numerical variables to normalize.

    ## 4.1.7: One-Hot Encoding

    One-Hot Encoding is a process of converting categorical variables into a format that is suitable for feeding into machine learning algorithms. In the dataset, there are no categorical variables to one-hot encode.

    ## 4.1.8: Splitting the Data

    Splitting the data into a training set and a test set is a common step in data preprocessing. The training set is used to train the model, and the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance.
