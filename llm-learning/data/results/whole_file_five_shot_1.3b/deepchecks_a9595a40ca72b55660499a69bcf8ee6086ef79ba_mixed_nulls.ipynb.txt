    The DeepChecks library in Python is used for data validation and quality checks. The MixedNulls check in DeepChecks is used to detect null values in a DataFrame.

    The function `MixedNulls().run(dataframe)` is used to run the check on the DataFrame. The check will return a DataFrame with the null values and their counts.
