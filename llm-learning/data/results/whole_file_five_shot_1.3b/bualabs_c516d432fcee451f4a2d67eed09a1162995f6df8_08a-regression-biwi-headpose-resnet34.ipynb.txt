    The notebook is designed to perform image processing and computer vision tasks using the FastAI library. It covers the basics of image data loading, image visualization, and the use of pre-trained models for image classification. The notebook also covers the process of converting biwi (Bowdoorn's Indoor Localization) coordinates to 3D coordinates, and the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The notebook also covers the training of the model, and the visualization of the learning curves.

    The notebook is designed to be interactive, allowing users to explore the data, visualize the results, and experiment with different parameters. The notebook also includes a section for testing the model's performance on unseen data.

    The notebook is designed to be a hands-on introduction to computer vision and image processing, and it is intended to be a useful resource for anyone interested in these topics.
