    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses Maven to manage dependencies, and it includes several cells that are used to install, import, and use libraries. 

    The first cell is used to define the repository URL for Maven. The next cells are used to install specific versions of libraries. The last cell is used to import the necessary libraries.

    The notebook is built using the Maven build system, which is a tool for managing dependencies and building Java projects. The libraries used in this notebook are:

    - ai.djl: This is a deep learning library for AI.
    - ai.djl.mxnet: This is a deep learning library for MXNet, a deep learning framework that supports a wide range of neural network architectures.
    - ai.djl.nn: This is a deep learning library for neural networks.
    - ai.djl.training: This is a deep learning library for training models.
    - tech.tablesaw: This is a library for data manipulation and analysis in Java.
    - tech.tablesaw.api: This is the main API for the Tablesaw library.
    - tech.tablesaw.plotly: This is a library for creating interactive plots in Java.

    The notebook also includes several cells that are used to load the necessary libraries, define the parameters for the training process, load the training and test data, define the loss function, train the model, and evaluate the model.

    The notebook is built using Jupyter Lab, which is a web-based interactive computational environment that supports Jupyter notebooks. The JSON viewer is a feature of Jupyter Lab that allows you to view the output of a cell as JSON.
