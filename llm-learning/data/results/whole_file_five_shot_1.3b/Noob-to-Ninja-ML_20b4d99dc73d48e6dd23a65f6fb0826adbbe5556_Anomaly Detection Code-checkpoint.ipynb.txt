    ## Anomaly Detection Notebook

    ### Introduction
    Anomaly detection is a critical part of data science and machine learning. It is a method of identifying outliers in a dataset. In this notebook, we will use the Kaggle competition data to train a model for anomaly detection.

    ### Data
    We will be using the 'creditcardfraud' dataset, which is a dataset containing all transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.

    ### Methodology
    We will use the Isolation Forest algorithm for anomaly detection. The Isolation Forest algorithm is a type of ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a forest of decision trees. It uses the partition of the data into a training set and a test set. The test set is used to evaluate the individual models.

    ### Results
    The notebook will provide a detailed analysis of the model's performance, including precision, recall, and F1-score.

    ### Conclusion
    This notebook provides a comprehensive guide to anomaly detection using the Isolation Forest algorithm.
