    ## Artificial Intelligence Projects
    # This project involves building a model to predict housing prices in Boston using various features.
    # The dataset is loaded from sklearn's built-in datasets module.
    # The model is trained using a maximum of 10-fold cross-validation.
    # The performance of the model is evaluated using the R^2 score.
    # The model's parameters are optimized using GridSearchCV.
    # The final model is used to make predictions on unseen client data.
    # The code is well-commented to make it easy to understand.

    ## Required Libraries
    # numpy, pandas, sklearn.cross_validation, sklearn.metrics, sklearn.tree, sklearn.grid_search, sklearn.datasets, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn.pairplot, seaborn.heatmap, seaborn.lmplot

    ## Conclusion
    # The model's performance is evaluated using the R^2 score.
    # The model's parameters are optimized using GridSearchCV.
    # The final model is used to make predictions on unseen client data.
    # The code is well-commented to make it easy to understand.
