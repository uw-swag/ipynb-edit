    The code cell is comparing the CPU and GPU training times. The training time is measured in terms of seconds. The training time on the CPU and GPU are different because the CPU is more efficient at processing small computations.

    However, it's important to note that the actual training times can vary depending on the specific hardware and the specific configuration of the machine on which the code is running.

    Also, the training time on the GPU can be significantly longer than the CPU, especially for complex models and large datasets, because the GPU is designed to perform more complex computations.

    Therefore, the GPU training time is generally more efficient for complex models and large datasets.

    The code cell also includes a function to normalize the input data, which is a common preprocessing step in machine learning.

    The code cell also includes a function to resize the input images, which is a common preprocessing step in image classification tasks.

    Finally, the code cell also includes a function to compare the number of parameters in the model, which is a common metric for model complexity.
