```python
    import torch

    # Create a simple model
    class Model(torch.nn.Module):
        def __init__(self):
            super(Model, self).__init__()
            self.linear = torch.nn.Linear(1, 1)

        def forward(self, x):
            y_pred = self.linear(x)
            return y_pred

    model = Model()

    # Create some dummy data
    x_train = torch.tensor([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]], dtype=torch.float32)
    y_train = torch.tensor([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]], dtype=torch.float32)

    # Define the optimizer
    optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

    # Train the model
    for epoch in range(1000):
        y_pred = model(x_train)
        loss = (y_pred - y_train).pow(2).sum()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()

    # Now, the model is trained, but the model parameters are not stored in the model object.
    # This is a common issue when using PyTorch, and it's not something that can be easily fixed.
    # The model parameters are stored in the optimizer, but not in the model object.
    # This is a known issue in PyTorch.

    # To fix this, you can use the `torch.save` function to save the model parameters.
    torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model.pth')

    # Then, you can load the model parameters and use them to make predictions.
    model = Model()
    model.load_state_dict(torch.load('model.pth'))
    y_pred = model(x_train)

    # Now, the model parameters are loaded into the model object, and you can use them to make predictions.
    ```
    This code is a simple demonstration of how to save
