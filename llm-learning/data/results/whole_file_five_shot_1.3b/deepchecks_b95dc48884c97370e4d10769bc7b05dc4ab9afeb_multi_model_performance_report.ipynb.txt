The commit message "remove label_name from dataset constructor (#456)" suggests that the label_name parameter is being removed from the Dataset constructor. This is a common practice in machine learning to ensure that the label is not included in the dataset, as it can lead to issues with model training and evaluation.

However, the code you provided is not actually modifying the Dataset object. It's creating a new Dataset object with the label_name parameter, but it's not actually modifying the original train and test datasets.

If you want to remove the label_name parameter from the Dataset constructor, you should be able to do so by removing the line from the code you provided. Here's how you can do it:

```python
train_ds = Dataset(train, label_name="target")
test_ds = Dataset(test, label_name="target")
```

This will create a new Dataset object without the label_name parameter, which should remove the label_name from the dataset.
