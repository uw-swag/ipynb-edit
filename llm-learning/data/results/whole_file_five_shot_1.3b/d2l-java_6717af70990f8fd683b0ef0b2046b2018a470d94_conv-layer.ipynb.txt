    The code you've provided seems to be a mix of Python and Maven commands, which is not valid. Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects, and Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language. The code you've provided is written in Python, not Maven.

    If you're looking to use Maven to build a Java project, you would need to use Maven commands instead of Python commands. For example, you would use the `mvn clean install` command to build your project.

    If you're looking to use Python to build a project, you would need to use Python commands instead of Maven commands. For example, you would use the `python setup.py build` command to build your project.

    If you're looking to use a combination of both, you would need to use a combination of Python and Maven commands. For example, you would use Python to build your project, and then use Maven to build the dependencies of your project.

    If you're looking to use a specific programming language, please provide more details so I can give a more accurate answer.
