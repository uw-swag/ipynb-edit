    The code you provided is a demonstration of how to use the DeepChecks library to perform label drift checks on a dataset. The checks include:

    1. `TrainTestLabelDrift`: This check is used to detect if the label distribution in the training set and the test set are different.

    2. `add_condition_drift_score_not_greater_than`: This condition is used to filter out the test set instances where the drift score is greater than a certain threshold.

    The code also demonstrates how to create a new DataFrame with a drifted label, and then re-run the checks on the new dataset.

    The results of the checks are returned as a DataFrame with the drift scores and the corresponding labels.

    Please note that the actual results of the checks will depend on the specifics of your dataset and the drift tolerance you set.
