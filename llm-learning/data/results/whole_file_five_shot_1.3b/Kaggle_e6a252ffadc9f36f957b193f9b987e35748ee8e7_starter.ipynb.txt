    The commit message "mapbox token change" suggests that the Mapbox access token has been changed. This is a common practice in data visualization projects to ensure that the visualization is displayed correctly.

    The original code cell is not provided, but it seems to be related to the use of the Mapbox API to visualize the data. The Mapbox access token is used to authenticate the API and provide the necessary permissions to access the data.

    The Mapbox access token is typically stored in a secure environment variable or a configuration file, and it's not included in the code for security reasons.

    If you're using this code in a production environment, you should replace the Mapbox access token with a secure method of storing and accessing it.
