    The code you provided seems to be a part of a Jupyter notebook, and it's using the Apache Maven and Flaml libraries to build and manage machine learning models.

    The code includes several cells that are used to set up the environment, install and import necessary libraries, and define some utility functions.

    The first cell sets up the Maven repository and the dependencies to be used. The second cell imports the necessary libraries and classes. The third cell defines some utility functions.

    The fourth cell defines a function to calculate the factorial of a number. The fifth cell defines a function to shuffle an array of numbers. The sixth cell defines a function to calculate the polynomial features.

    The seventh cell defines a function to train a model. The eighth cell trains a model with a degree of 20. The ninth and tenth cells train a model with a degree of 3 and 4 respectively.

    The eleventh cell defines a function to render a line plot.

    The last cell trains a model with a degree of 20 on a subset of the data.

    Please note that the code is written in a Jupyter notebook format, which is a web-based interactive computational environment that supports both code and rich media.

    The code is written in Python, and it uses the Flaml library for machine learning. The Flaml library is a Python library for building, training, and deploying machine learning models.

    The code also uses the Apache Maven library for managing Java projects and their dependencies.

    The code is a part of a larger project, and it's using the Flaml library to build and manage machine learning models.
