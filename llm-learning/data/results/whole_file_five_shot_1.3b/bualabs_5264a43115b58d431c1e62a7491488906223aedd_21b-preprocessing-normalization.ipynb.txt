    This notebook is about preprocessing data for a machine learning model. The preprocessing steps include normalization, standardization, and visualization.

    The data is a pandas DataFrame with columns for 'Name', 'Age', 'Height', and 'Weight'. The 'Age', 'Height', and 'Weight' columns are numeric and need to be normalized or standardized to prepare them for machine learning models.

    The preprocessing steps are:

    1. Min-Max Normalization: This scales the data to a range of 0 to 1. It's useful for data that is on a similar scale.

    2. Mean Normalization: This subtracts the mean of the data and divides by the standard deviation. It's useful for data that has a Gaussian distribution.

    3. Standardization: This standardizes the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. It's useful for data that has a Gaussian distribution.

    The preprocessed data is then plotted to visualize the distribution of each feature.

    The final plots show the preprocessed data before and after each normalization or standardization step.

    The plots are useful for understanding the impact of normalization or standardization on the data.

    The preprocessing steps are performed in the notebook cells starting with `<Cell_0>` to `<Cell_10>`.

    The final plot is shown in the notebook cell `<Cell_11>`.
