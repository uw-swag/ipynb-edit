    The code provided is a robustness report for a DeepChecks classification model. The report includes loading the necessary datasets, creating a model, and running a performance check on the model. The performance check is based on the ClassPerformance check, which measures the performance of a classification model by comparing the model's predictions to the actual labels.

    The report also includes a number of cells that load datasets, create a model, and run a performance check. The performance check is based on the ClassPerformance check, which measures the performance of a classification model by comparing the model's predictions to the actual labels.
