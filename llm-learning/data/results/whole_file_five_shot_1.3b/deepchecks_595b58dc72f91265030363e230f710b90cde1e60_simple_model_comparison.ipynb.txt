    ## Vision Documentation

    Vision is a machine learning model that is used to predict the next action in a user's journey. It is designed to understand the user's behavior and make predictions about what action they might take next.

    ### Features

    - **User Behavior Understanding**: Vision uses a combination of machine learning algorithms to understand the user's behavior and make predictions about what action they might take next.

    - **Contextual Understanding**: Vision also uses contextual information to make more accurate predictions. This includes information about the user's previous actions, the time they were in the app, and the device they were using.

    - **Action Prediction**: Vision uses a sequence model to predict the next action in a user's journey. This model is trained on a large dataset of user behavior, and it can make predictions for a wide range of actions.

    - **Real-time Updates**: Vision is designed to provide real-time updates to the user. This means that it can provide instant feedback on the next action, and it can adjust its predictions based on the user's behavior.

    ### How It Works

    Vision works by analyzing the user's behavior and contextual information to make predictions about what action they might take next. It then uses a sequence model to predict the next action in the user's journey. The sequence model is trained on a large dataset of user behavior, and it can make predictions for a wide range of actions.

    Vision is designed to be user-friendly and provide real-time updates to the user, making it easy for users to understand and take actions.

    ### Future Plans

    As Vision continues to evolve, we plan to add more features and improve the accuracy of our predictions. We also plan to make Vision more accessible to a wider range of users, and to integrate it with other tools in the user's journey.
