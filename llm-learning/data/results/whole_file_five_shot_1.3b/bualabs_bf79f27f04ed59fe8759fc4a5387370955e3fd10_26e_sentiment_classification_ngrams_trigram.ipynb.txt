    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that includes several sections for text processing, feature extraction, and matrix creation. Here's a brief explanation of each section:

1. **Importing necessary libraries and modules**: This section imports the necessary libraries and modules for text processing, feature extraction, and matrix creation.

2. **Downloading resources**: This section downloads the resources required for the deep learning model.

3. **Reading and preprocessing the data**: This section reads the data, performs text cleaning, and preprocessing.

4. **Creating the training and validation sets**: This section splits the data into training and validation sets.

5. **Feature extraction**: This section extracts features from the text data.

6. **Creating the document-ngram matrix**: This section creates a sparse matrix representation of the document-ngram data.

7. **Saving the matrices**: This section saves the document-ngram matrix to disk.

8. **Loading the matrices**: This section loads the saved document-ngram matrices from disk.

9. **Pickling the dictionaries**: This section pickles the dictionaries of the itongram and ngramtoi dictionaries.

10. **Creating the ngram counter**: This section creates a counter for the ngrams.

11. **Creating the ngram to index mapping**: This section creates a dictionary that maps ngrams to their corresponding indices.

12. **Creating the ngram document matrix**: This section creates a sparse matrix representation of the ngram data.

13. **Saving the ngram document matrix**: This section saves the ngram document matrix to disk.

14. **Loading the ngram document matrix**: This section loads the saved ngram document matrix from disk.

15. **Pickling the dictionaries**: This section pickles the dictionaries of the itongram and ngramtoi dictionaries.

16. **Creating the itongram counter**: This section creates a counter for the itongrams.

17. **Creating the itongram to index mapping**: This section creates a dictionary that maps itongrams to their corresponding indices.

18. **Creating the
