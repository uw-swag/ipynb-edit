The numerical stability formula is a method to stabilize the training of deep learning models. It involves techniques to prevent the exploding or vanishing gradients problem, which can lead to unstable training.

In the context of deep learning, the numerical stability formula is used to prevent the exploding or vanishing gradients problem. The formula is as follows:

Stabilized Gradient = (1 - η * δ(z)) * g

where:
- g is the gradient computed during backpropagation.
- z is the output of a neuron.
- η is the learning rate.
- δ(z) is the smooth approximation of the Dirac delta function.

The stabilized gradient is then used to update the weights of the model. This ensures that the gradients are not exploding or vanishing, which can lead to unstable training.

The numerical stability formula is used in the Adam optimizer, a popular choice for training deep learning models.
