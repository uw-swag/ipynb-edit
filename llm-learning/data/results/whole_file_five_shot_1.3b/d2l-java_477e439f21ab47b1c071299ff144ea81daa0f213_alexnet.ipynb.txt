    The commit message "Upgrade to djl 0.13.0 (#176)" is a release note for the Deep Java Library (djl). The djl is a machine learning library for Java that provides a high-level API for building and training machine learning models. The release includes several improvements and bug fixes.

    The code cells in the commit message are:

    1. `%load ../utils/djl-imports`: This line is used to load the import statements for the djl library.

    2. `%load ../utils/plot-utils`: This line is used to load the plot utilities for the djl library.

    3. `%load ../utils/Training.java`: This line is used to load the Training class from the Training.java file.

    4. `%load ../utils/Accumulator.java`: This line is used to load the Accumulator class from the Accumulator.java file.

    5. `import ai.djl.basicdataset.cv.classification.*;`: This line imports the necessary classes from the ai.djl.basicdataset.cv.classification package.

    6. `NDManager manager = NDManager.newBaseManager();`: This line creates a new instance of the NDManager class.

    7. `SequentialBlock block = new SequentialBlock();`: This line creates a new instance of the SequentialBlock class.

    8. `block.add(Conv2d.builder()...`: This line adds a convolutional layer to the block.

    9. `block.add(Activation::relu)`: This line adds the ReLU activation function to the block.

    The rest of the code cells are used to perform various operations related to the djl library.
