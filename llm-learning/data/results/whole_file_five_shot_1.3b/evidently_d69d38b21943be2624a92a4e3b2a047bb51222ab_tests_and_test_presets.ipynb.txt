    The commit message "Rename test presets (#402)" suggests that the test presets are being renamed. This could be due to a change in the test suite or the naming of the tests. Here's a brief explanation of the changes:

    1. The test presets are imported from the evidently library.
    2. The test presets are used to test the dataset.
    3. The test presets are run on the reference and current data.
    4. The results of the tests are returned as a dictionary.
    5. The test presets are also used to test the feature level.
    6. The test presets are used to test the data drift and stability.
    7. The test presets are used to test the data quality.
    8. The test presets are used to test the performance of the model without a target.

    The test presets are used to ensure that the dataset is well-suited for the model. If the dataset is not well-suited, the model may not perform well.

    The test presets are also used to ensure that the model is not overfitting the data. If the model is overfitting, it may perform poorly on new data.

    The test presets are used to ensure that the model is not underfitting the data. If the model is underfitting, it may perform poorly on the training data.

    The test presets are used to ensure that the model is not biased. If the model is biased, it may perform poorly on the training data.

    The test presets are used to ensure that the model is not too complex. If the model is too complex, it may perform poorly on the training data.

    The test presets are used to ensure that the model is not too simple. If the model is too simple, it may perform poorly on the training data.

    The test presets are used to ensure that the model is not too noisy. If the model is too noisy, it may perform poorly on the training data.

    The test presets are used to ensure that the model is not too sparse. If the model is too sparse, it may perform poorly on the training data.

    The test presets are used to ensure that the model is not too different. If the model is too different, it may
