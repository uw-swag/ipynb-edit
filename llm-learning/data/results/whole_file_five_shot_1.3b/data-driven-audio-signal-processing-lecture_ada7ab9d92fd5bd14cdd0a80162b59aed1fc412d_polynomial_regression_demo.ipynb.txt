    The code you provided is a set of Jupyter notebooks that perform polynomial regression on a set of data points, add Gaussian noise, and then plot the data points, the regression lines, and the residuals. The notebooks also calculate the total sum-of-squares (TSS), residual sum-of-squares (RSS), and the coefficient of determination (R^2) for the polynomial regression model.

    The notebooks are re-run to ensure that the code works as expected. The code is fixed to ensure that the polynomial regression model is correctly implemented. The code is also migrated to AudioMNIST for digit recognition, which is a dataset of audio clips of digits. The notebooks are re-run to ensure that the code works as expected.
