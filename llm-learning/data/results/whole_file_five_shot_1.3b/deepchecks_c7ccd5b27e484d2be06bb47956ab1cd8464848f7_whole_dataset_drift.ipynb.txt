    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook that uses the Deepchecks library to analyze the drift in a dataset. The notebook first imports necessary libraries and loads the dataset. Then, it creates a dataset object for both the training and testing datasets. 

    After that, it creates a WholeDatasetDrift check to analyze the drift in the entire dataset. The check is then run on both the training and testing datasets. 

    The next part of the code is a part of a larger code block, but it seems to be related to the creation of a new dataset that contains a subset of the original dataset, and then it runs a new WholeDatasetDrift check on this new dataset.

    The last part of the code is a part of a larger code block, but it seems to be related to the creation of a new dataset that contains a subset of the original dataset, and then it runs a new WholeDatasetDrift check on this new dataset, but with a condition that checks if the overall drift value is not greater than 0.1.

    The code you provided is a good example of how to use the Deepchecks library to analyze the drift in a dataset.
