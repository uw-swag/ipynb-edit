    The code you provided is a part of a larger project, and it's not clear what the purpose of the refactoring and cleanup is. However, I can provide some general suggestions for refactoring and cleanup:

    1. **Modularize the code**: Break down the code into smaller, more manageable functions or classes. This makes the code easier to read, test, and maintain.

    2. **Use meaningful variable and function names**: Avoid using generic names like "X", "Y", "manager", etc. These can make the code harder to understand.

    3. **Remove unnecessary code**: If a piece of code is not used in the current context, it can be removed.

    4. **Use comments and docstrings**: These can help other developers understand the purpose of a piece of code.

    5. **Error handling**: Make sure to handle potential errors gracefully. This can help prevent the program from crashing and makes it easier to debug.

    6. **Consistent naming conventions**: Follow a consistent naming convention for variables, functions, and classes. This makes the code easier to read and understand.

    7. **Use version control**: If the code is part of a larger project, consider using a version control system like Git. This can help track changes, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions if necessary.

    8. **Documentation**: Document your code well. This includes comments, docstrings, and usage examples. This can help other developers understand your code and use it.

    9. **Testing**: Write tests for your code. This can help ensure that it works as expected and can be used to identify and fix bugs.

    10. **Code formatting**: Follow a consistent code formatting style. This can help make the code easier to read and understand.

    Please provide more context or specific requirements for a more detailed refactoring and cleanup.
