    The lambda function is a small anonymous function that is defined with the lambda keyword. It can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression. The lambda function is used when we need a small, one-time function.

    The lambda function is used in a few different ways in Python, including:

    1. Filtering data: Lambda functions are used in the filter() function to filter out certain data from a list.
    2. Sorting data: Lambda functions are used in the sorted() function to sort data.
    3. Mapping data: Lambda functions are used in the map() function to apply a function to all items in an input list.

    The lambda function is a great tool for quick, one-off functions, but for more complex operations, it's better to use normal functions.
