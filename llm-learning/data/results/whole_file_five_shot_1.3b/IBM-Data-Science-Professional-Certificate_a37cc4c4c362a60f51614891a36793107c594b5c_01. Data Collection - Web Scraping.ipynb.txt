    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses BeautifulSoup, requests, and pandas to scrape data from a Wikipedia page and store it in a DataFrame. The scraped data includes information about SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches, including flight numbers, launch dates, times, booster versions, launch sites, payloads, payload masses, orbits, customers, launch outcomes, and booster landing statuses. The data is then stored in a CSV file.

    The notebook starts by installing the necessary libraries (BeautifulSoup4, requests, and pandas) using pip. It then makes a request to a Wikipedia page containing information about SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches. The BeautifulSoup object is created from the response text, and the title of the page is printed. The notebook then finds all tables in the page and prints the third one.

    The notebook then extracts the column names from the first table, removes an irrelevant column, and initializes a dictionary with each column as a key. The notebook then iterates over each table in the page, extracting the flight number, date, time, booster version, launch site, payload, payload mass, orbit, customer, launch outcome, and booster landing status for each flight. The data is stored in a dictionary, and the dictionary is converted to a DataFrame. The DataFrame is then saved to a CSV file.

    The notebook ends with a final print statement, showing the number of rows in the DataFrame.

    Please note that this code is a basic example and may not work as expected for all websites or for all types of data. It is always a good idea to check the website's `robots.txt` file to ensure that you are allowed to scrape it.
