The code you provided is a series of operations on a dataset, including data loading, data exploration, data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training. Here's a brief explanation of each section:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: The code loads a dataset from a CSV file and displays the first 3 rows. It also prints the shape of the dataframe.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: The code splits the data into a training set and a test set. It also drops columns with only one unique value, as they are considered constant features.

3. **Feature Selection**: The code uses the VarianceThreshold and SelectKBest methods to select features. It also drops constant features.

4. **Model Training**: The code uses DecisionTreeRegressor and DecisionTreeClassifier models to train the models. It also calculates the RMSE and ROC AUC for each feature.

5. **Feature Selection**: The code uses mutual_info_classif and chi2 methods to select features. It also calculates the RMSE and ROC AUC for each feature.

6. **Feature Selection**: The code uses a threshold to select features. It calculates the RMSE and ROC AUC for each feature.

7. **Feature Selection**: The code uses a threshold to select features. It calculates the RMSE and ROC AUC for each feature.

8. **Feature Selection**: The code uses a threshold to select features. It calculates the RMSE and ROC AUC for each feature.

9. **Feature Selection**: The code uses a threshold to select features. It calculates the RMSE and ROC AUC for each feature.

10. **Feature Selection**: The code uses a threshold to select features. It calculates the RMSE and ROC AUC for each feature.

11. **Feature Selection**: The code uses a threshold to select features. It calculates the RMSE and ROC AUC for each feature.

12. **Feature Selection**: The code uses a threshold to select features. It calculates the RMSE and ROC AUC for each feature.

13. **Feature Selection**: The code uses
