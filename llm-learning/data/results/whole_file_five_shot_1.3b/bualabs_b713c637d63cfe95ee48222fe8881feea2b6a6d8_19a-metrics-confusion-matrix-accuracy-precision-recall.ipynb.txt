    ## Metrics Notebook

    ## Overview
    This notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of the metrics used in the model. The metrics used in this model are:

    - Accuracy: The ratio of correct predictions to the total number of predictions.
    - Precision: The ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives.
    - Recall (Sensitivity): The ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives.
    - F1 Score: The weighted average of Precision and Recall.
    - AUC-ROC: The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) curve.
    - Confusion Matrix: A table that describes the performance of a classification model.

    ## Import Libraries
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, roc_auc_score, confusion_matrix
    ```

    ## Load Data
    ```python
    # Load your data here
    df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')
    ```

    ## Calculate Metrics
    ```python
    # Calculate metrics here
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
    precision = precision_score(y_true, y_pred)
    recall = recall_score(y_true, y_pred)
    f1 = f1_score(y_true, y_pred)
    auc = roc_auc_score(y_true, y_pred)
    cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)
    ```

    ## Plot Metrics
    ```python
    # Plot metrics here
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 6))

    sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues', ax=ax[0])
    ax[0].set_title('
