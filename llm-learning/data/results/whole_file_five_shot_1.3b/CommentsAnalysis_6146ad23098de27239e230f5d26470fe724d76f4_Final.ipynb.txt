    The code is trying to perform various operations on a dataset, such as text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and prediction. The operations are performed in a sequence, with each operation using the results of the previous one as input.

    The code also includes some machine learning models, such as logistic regression, and it uses the Scikit-learn library in Python.

    The code also includes some data manipulation and visualization operations, such as creating a new column, calculating statistics, and creating histograms.

    The code also includes some data cleaning operations, such as removing duplicate comments, and it uses the pandas library in Python.

    The code also includes some model evaluation operations, such as calculating accuracy, and it uses the Scikit-learn library in Python.

    The code also includes some model training operations, such as training a logistic regression model, and it uses the Keras library in Python.

    The code also includes some data visualization operations, such as creating histograms, and it uses the matplotlib library in Python.
