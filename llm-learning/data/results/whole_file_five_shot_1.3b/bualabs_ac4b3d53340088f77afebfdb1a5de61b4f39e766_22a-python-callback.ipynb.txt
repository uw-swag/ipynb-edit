```python
    # Move notebook file to nbs folder
    import os
    import shutil

    # Get the current working directory
    cwd = os.getcwd()

    # Get the list of all files in the current directory
    files = os.listdir(cwd)

    # Loop through each file
    for file in files:
        # If the file is a notebook file
        if file.endswith(".ipynb"):
            # Get the full path of the file
            file_path = os.path.join(cwd, file)
            # Get the name of the file without the extension
            file_name = os.path.splitext(file)[0]
            # Move the file to the nbs folder
            shutil.move(file_path, os.path.join(cwd, "nbs", file_name + ".ipynb"))
    ```
    This script will move all notebook files in the current directory to a new "nbs" folder.
