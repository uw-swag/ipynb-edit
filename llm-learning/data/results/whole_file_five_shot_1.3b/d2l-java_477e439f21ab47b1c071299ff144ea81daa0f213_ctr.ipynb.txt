The changes include the addition of new features and improvements to the existing features.

    The new features include:
    - Support for more than 200 million parameters in the model.
    - Improved performance and efficiency.
    - More efficient training and evaluation.

    The improvements include:
    - Improved compatibility with other DJL libraries.
    - Better support for distributed training.
    - Improved support for more complex models.

    The changes are made in the following cells:
    - `%maven ai.djl:api:0.8.0`
    - `%maven ai.djl:basicdataset:0.8.0`
    - `%maven ai.djl:model-zoo:0.8.0`
    - `%maven ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-engine:0.8.0`
    - `%maven org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.26`

    The `opt` methods are used to set optional parameters for the `Builder` class.

    The `build` method is used to build the `CTRDataset` object.

    The `saveMap` method is used to save the feature map and default values for inference.
