    ## This is an example of how to use the LabelAmbiguity check in Deepchecks.
    ## The check is used to find and remove ambiguous labels.

    ## Run the check
    LabelAmbiguity().run(dataset)

    ## This will show the results of the check.
    ## The check will return a DataFrame with the labels that are ambiguous.
    ## You can then decide which labels to remove.

    ## Run the check with specific columns
    LabelAmbiguity(columns=['col1', 'my_label']).run(dataset)

    ## This will show the results of the check with specific columns.
    ## The check will return a DataFrame with the labels that are ambiguous.
    ## You can then decide which labels to remove.
    ```
