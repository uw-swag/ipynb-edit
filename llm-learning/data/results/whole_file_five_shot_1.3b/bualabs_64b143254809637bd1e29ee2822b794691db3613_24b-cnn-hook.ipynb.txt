    The code you provided is a complete script for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model on the MNIST dataset using PyTorch and FastAI.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The script starts by importing necessary libraries and defining some global variables.
    - It then downloads the MNIST dataset and resizes it to 28x28 pixels.
    - The `Dataset` class is defined to create a custom dataset for the CNN model.
    - The `get_cnn_model` function is used to create a CNN model.
    - The `Runner` class is used to manage the training process. It includes callbacks for recording learning statistics, managing the learning rate schedules, and using CUDA for faster computation.
    - The `Learner` class is used to create a model for training and validating.
    - The script then trains the model for 4 epochs and plots the activation means and standard deviations over the training and validation datasets.

    Please note that the code is written in a Jupyter notebook format, and it may not run directly in a standard Python environment.
