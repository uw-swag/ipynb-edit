    Reverting the changes in the notebook as the commit message "Updating example notebooks" suggests that the notebook is being updated with new examples. However, the code provided in the commit is not related to the notebook's purpose or functionality. It's a demonstration of how to use the deepchecks library to create a suite of checks for model performance, and then run these checks on a random forest classifier model.

    If you have any other questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.
