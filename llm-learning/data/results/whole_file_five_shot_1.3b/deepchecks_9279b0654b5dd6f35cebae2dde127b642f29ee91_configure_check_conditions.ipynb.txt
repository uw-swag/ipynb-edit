    The code you provided is a collection of examples and explanations for different tasks. Here's a brief explanation of each code snippet:

    1. `<Cell_0>`: This cell is an example of using the `DatasetsSizeComparison` check. It creates a check that tests the size of the test dataset to be smaller than 1000.

    2. `<Cell_1>`: This cell is an example of using the `Dataset` class to create a dataset and a suite of checks. It creates a dataset with a single column 'x' filled with numbers from 1 to 9, and a test dataset with the first three rows. The `DatasetsSizeComparison` check is then run on the train and test datasets.

    3. `<Cell_2>`: This cell is an example of using the `train_test_leakage` suite. It creates a suite with a check that compares the size of the train and test datasets.

    4. `<Cell_3>`: This cell is an example of accessing a check in a suite by its id. It removes a condition from the check.

    5. `<Cell_4>`: This cell is an example of adding a new condition to a check. It adds a condition that checks if the feature 'pps' (predicted positive samples per second) difference is not greater than 0.01.

    6. `<Cell_5>`: This cell is an example of creating a custom condition for a check. It checks if the 'Test' and 'Train' sizes are between 0.4 and 0.6.

    7. `<Cell_6>`: This cell is an example of creating a check with a custom condition. It creates a check that compares the 'Test' and 'Train' sizes.

    8. `<Cell_7>`: This cell is an example of running a check and condition on a suite. It uses the check and condition to compare the size of the train and test datasets.

    9. `<Cell_8>`: This cell is an example of creating a custom condition for a check. It checks if the 'Test' and 'Train' sizes are between 0.3 and 0.7. It also has different levels of severity for the condition.
