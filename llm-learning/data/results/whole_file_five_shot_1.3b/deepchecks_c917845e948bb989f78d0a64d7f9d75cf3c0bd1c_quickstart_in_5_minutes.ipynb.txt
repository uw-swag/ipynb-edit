    The code you provided is for a progress bar widget in a Jupyter notebook. However, the code you provided is not complete and does not provide a complete solution. 

    The code is incomplete because it does not provide a complete solution. The code is missing the part where the progress bar is updated. 

    Here is a complete example of how to use a progress bar in a Jupyter notebook:

    ```python
    import time
    import ipywidgets as widgets

    # Create a progress bar
    progress = widgets.IntProgress(min=0, max=100, value=0)

    # Display the progress bar
    display(progress)

    for i in range(101):
        time.sleep(0.1)  # Simulate some work
        progress.value = i + 1  # Update the progress bar
        print(f"Progress: {i+1}/100")
    ```

    This code will create a progress bar that updates in real-time as it simulates some work. The progress bar will display the current progress and the total number of iterations.

    However, the code you provided is not complete because it does not provide a complete solution. The code is missing the part where the progress bar is updated.

    display(progress)

    for i in range(101):

        progress.value = i + 1  # Update the progress bar
        print(f"Progress: {i+1}/100")
