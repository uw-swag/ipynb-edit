The code you provided is a script that collects temperature data for a certain period of time and then plots the data. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. The script first reads the temperature value from the XADC (analog to digital converter) and converts it to a float.
2. It then stores the temperature value in a list for later use.
3. The script then starts a timer that records the temperature every 15 seconds.
4. It also displays a timer and the number of temperature values recorded to the user.
5. After the timer runs out, it stops recording and displays a final message.
6. Finally, it plots the recorded temperature data.

If you want to remove the notebooks from the root folder, you can do so by deleting the notebooks themselves. However, be aware that this will also delete any files or folders that were created in the notebooks.

If you want to keep the notebooks but not the files or folders, you can rename the notebooks or move them to a different location.

Here's how you can rename a notebook:

```python
import os
os.rename('current_notebook_name.ipynb', 'new_notebook_name.ipynb')
```

And here's how you can move a notebook:

```python
import os
os.rename('current_notebook_path', 'new_notebook_path')
```

Please replace 'current_notebook_name.ipynb' and 'new_notebook_name.ipynb' with the actual names of your notebooks, and 'current_notebook_path' and 'new_notebook_path' with the actual paths of your notebooks.
