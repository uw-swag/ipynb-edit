```python
    import numpy as np
    from keras.models import Sequential
    from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

    # Assuming you have a dataset of music notes
    # Each row in the dataset is a note, and the columns are the features of the note
    # For example, you might have a dataset where each row is a note and the columns are the pitch, velocity, and other features
    data = np.load('music_dataset.npy')

    # Split the data into input and output
    X, y = data[:, :-1], data[:, -1]

    # Reshape the input to be [samples, time steps, features]
    X = X.reshape((X.shape[0], X.shape[1], 1))

    # Define the LSTM model
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(LSTM(50, input_shape=(X.shape[1], X.shape[2])))
    model.add(Dense(1))

    # Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, verbose=0)

    This code provides a simple example of how to use an LSTM network to predict the next note in a music sequence. The LSTM network is trained on a dataset of music notes, and it can be used to generate new music.

    Please note that this is a very basic example and a real-world application would require more complex data preprocessing and model tuning.

    Also, the 'music_dataset.npy' file is a placeholder for your actual dataset. You would need to replace it with your actual dataset.

    The 'music_dataset.npy' file should be a numpy array where each row is a note, and the columns are the features of the note. The last column should be the label of the note.

    The LSTM network is a type of recurrent neural network, which is a type of neural network that can make use of information from previous time steps to make predictions about the next time step.
