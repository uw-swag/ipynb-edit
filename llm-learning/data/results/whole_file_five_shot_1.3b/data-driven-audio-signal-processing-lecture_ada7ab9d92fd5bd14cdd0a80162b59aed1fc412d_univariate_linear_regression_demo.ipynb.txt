The code you provided seems to be a mix of Python and Jupyter notebook code. It's a simple linear regression model, with a few additional features. Here's a brief explanation of what each section of the code does:

1. The first part imports the necessary libraries.
2. The next part defines the parameters for the model.
3. The next part generates the data.
4. The next part defines a function to plot the data.
5. The next part calculates the estimated parameters using the formula for linear regression.
6. The next part prints the estimated parameters.
7. The next part plots the data and the estimated regression line.
8. The next part calculates the residuals and plots them.
9. The next part calculates the total sum of squares (TSS), residual sum of squares (RSS), and the coefficient of determination (R^2).
