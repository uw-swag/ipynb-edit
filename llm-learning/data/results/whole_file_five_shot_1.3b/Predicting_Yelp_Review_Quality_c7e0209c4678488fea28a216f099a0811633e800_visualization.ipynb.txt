    ## Project Overview
    This project is focused on the Yelp dataset, which includes reviews and user data. The goal is to analyze the data to gain insights and make predictions.

    ## Data Storage
    The data is stored in a PostgreSQL database. The database is connected using the psycopg2 library. The data is read from the database using pandas, a powerful data manipulation library.

    ## Data Structure
    The data is structured in a tabular format, with each row representing a review and each column representing a different feature. The data is cleaned and preprocessed before being used for analysis.

    ## Pipeline
    The pipeline is designed to handle the data storage, data cleaning, and data preprocessing steps. It also includes data analysis and visualization steps.

    ## Insights
    The insights gained from the data analysis can be used for various purposes, such as predicting the sentiment of a review, recommending products, or understanding user behavior.

    ## Future Improvements
    The project could be improved by adding more features to the data analysis, such as the number of positive and negative reviews, the average rating, or the time since the review was posted. Additionally, the pipeline could be improved by adding more data cleaning and preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values and outliers.
