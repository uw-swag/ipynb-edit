    The code you've provided is used to calculate the entropy of the probabilities of each team winning the match, and then plot this entropy as a heatmap. The heatmap shows the average entropy of matches in each season for each league. The x-axis represents the seasons, and the y-axis represents the leagues. The color of each cell represents the average entropy of matches.

    The code also uses the matplotlib and seaborn libraries to create the heatmap. The 'annotate' function is used to add text annotations to the plot, which are used to indicate the range of values for each league.

    The 'plot' function is used to create the heatmap, and the 'legend' function is used to add a legend to the plot.

    The 'pivot' function is used to reshape the data so that it's easier to plot.
