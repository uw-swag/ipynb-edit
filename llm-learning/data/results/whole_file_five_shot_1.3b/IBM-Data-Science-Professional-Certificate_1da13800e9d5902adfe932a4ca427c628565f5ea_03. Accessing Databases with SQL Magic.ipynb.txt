```python
    # Accessing Databases with SQL Magic

    # Importing necessary libraries
    import pandas as pd
    import sqlalchemy as db

    # Creating a connection to the database
    connection_string = "postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/mydatabase"
    engine = db.create_engine(connection_string)

    # Reading a table from the database
    table_name = "my_table"
    df = pd.read_sql_table(table_name, engine)

    # Displaying the first few rows of the dataframe
    print(df.head())

    # Closing the connection
    engine.dispose()
    ```

    This code snippet demonstrates how to access a database using SQL Magic in Jupyter notebook. It connects to a PostgreSQL database, reads a table from the database, and then displays the first few rows of the dataframe. The connection string, table name, and other details should be replaced with the actual values for your specific database.
