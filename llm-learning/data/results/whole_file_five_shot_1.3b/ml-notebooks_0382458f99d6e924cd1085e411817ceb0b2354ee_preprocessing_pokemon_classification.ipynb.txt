    This notebook uses the Naive Bayes classifier to classify human activity based on the text data in a dataset. The dataset should be a CSV file with two columns: 'text' and 'activity'. The 'text' column should contain the text data and the 'activity' column should contain the activity label. The notebook then trains a model on this data and makes predictions on unseen data. The classification report at the end of the notebook provides a summary of the model's performance.
