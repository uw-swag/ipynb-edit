    The code you provided is a practical for Linear Algebra Practical 4. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    1. The first part of the code imports necessary libraries.
    2. It reads the CSV file and displays the first 5 rows.
    3. It selects the first 200 rows from the 'Benign' and 'Malignant' classes.
    4. It plots scatter plots of 'Clump' and 'UnifSize' for both classes.
    5. It converts the 'BareNuc' column to numeric and replaces any null values with the mean of the column.
    6. It selects the first 9 columns from the dataframe and assigns them to the 'feature_df'.
    7. It splits the data into training and testing sets with a test size of 0.2.
    8. It trains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on the training data.
    9. It predicts the class of the test data and prints a classification report.

    Please note that the code provided is a basic example and may need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of your project.
    Also, the SVM classifier used here is a simple one and may not be the best choice for all types of data. You may need to experiment with different classifiers to achieve better results.
