    The code you provided is a complete Python script that uses the libraries mentioned in the code to perform a dataset analysis on a bike sharing dataset. The script includes data loading, data structure inspection, data drift detection, and more.

    The script uses the pandas, numpy, requests, zipfile, io, mlflow, and plotly libraries for data manipulation and analysis. It also uses the evidently library for data drift detection.

    The script also uses the mlflow library to log the results of the analysis and to visualize the data drift.

    The script also uses the plotly library to create visualizations of the data drift.

    The script also uses the mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient to log the results of the analysis.

    The script uses the mlflow.set_experiment function to set the experiment name.

    The script uses the mlflow.start_run function to start a new run.

    The script uses the mlflow.log_param and mlflow.log_metric functions to log the parameters and metrics of the analysis.

    The script uses the mlflow.ui function to start the MLflow UI.

    The script uses the !mlflow ui command to run the MLflow UI.

    The script uses the mlflow.log_param and mlflow.log_metric functions to log the parameters and metrics of the analysis.

    The script uses the mlflow.set_experiment function to set the experiment name.

    The script uses the mlflow.start_run function to start a new run.

    The script uses the mlflow.ui function to start the MLflow UI.

    The script uses the !mlflow ui command to run the MLflow UI.

    The script uses the mlflow.log_param and mlflow.log_metric functions to log the parameters and metrics of the analysis.

    The script uses the mlflow.set_experiment function to set the experiment name.

    The script uses the mlflow.start_run function to start a new run.

    The script uses the mlflow.ui function to start the MLflow UI.
