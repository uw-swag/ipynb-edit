    ## Updating Readme(s) and Iris example notebook (#181)

    This commit updates the README.md file with a link to the Iris example notebook (#181) and also updates the notebook to include the Iris dataset.

    ## Iris Example Notebook

    The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the scikit-learn library. It contains measurements of 150 iris flowers from three different species.

    The notebook includes the following steps:

    1. **Data Exploration**: This step includes loading the Iris dataset, checking for missing values, and understanding the structure of the dataset.

    2. **Data Preprocessing**: This step includes encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and splitting the dataset into training and validation sets.

    3. **Model Training**: This step includes training a model on the training data, and evaluating its performance on the validation data.

    4. **Model Evaluation**: This step includes comparing the model's performance on the training and validation sets, and making any necessary adjustments to the model.

    The notebook also includes a section for **Model Interpretation**, which provides a step-by-step explanation of how the model makes its predictions.

    The notebook is available at: [Iris Notebook](https://github.com/ethen8181/notebook_format/blob/master/notebooks/Iris%20Example.ipynb)
