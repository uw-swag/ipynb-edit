    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook that uses the pandas, numpy, scipy, sklearn, and evidently libraries to perform statistical tests and data analysis on a dataset.

    The code is designed to calculate the data drift between two samples, and then compare the results of the statistical tests. The code also includes a target drift analysis, which is a type of data drift where the target variable is compared between two samples.

    The code uses the `DataDriftTab` and `CatTargetDriftTab` from the evidently library to display the data drift and target drift visualizations.

    The code also uses the `StatTest` class from the evidently library to perform the statistical tests. The `_anderson_stat_test` function is used to perform the Anderson test, which is a non-parametric test for the presence of autocorrelation in a sequence.

    The code also uses the `DataDriftOptions` class from the evidently library to set the options for the data drift and target drift visualizations.

    The code uses the `Dashboard` class from the evidently library to create a dashboard with the data drift and target drift visualizations.
