    The code you provided seems to be a build script for a Maven project. It's not clear what the purpose of these cells is, but they seem to be part of a larger script that's used to build a Maven project.

    The first cell is a Maven repository configuration. It's setting up a Maven repository for the SNAPSHOT versions of the `ai.djl` and `ai.djl.mxnet` libraries.

    The second cell is loading a module that contains utility functions for plotting.

    The third cell is importing a few Java libraries and defining a function that applies a function to an array of numbers.

    The fourth cell is defining a function `f` and `g`, and using them to calculate risk values.

    The fifth cell is creating a table of data with columns for `x`, `risk`, and `grouping`, and then creating a line plot of this data.

    The sixth cell is creating a table of data with columns for `x` and `f(x)`, and then creating a line plot of this data.

    The seventh cell is defining a function `cube` and using it to calculate risk values.

    The eighth cell is defining a function `tanh` and using it to calculate risk values.

    The ninth cell is an empty cell.
