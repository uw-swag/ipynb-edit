    # Improve the model training and evaluation

    ## Model Training
    # We're using Linear Regression as it's a simple and efficient model for regression tasks.

    ## Model Evaluation
    # We're using R-squared (R2 score) as it's a measure of how well the regression predictions approximate the real data points.

    ## Hyperparameter Tuning
    # We're using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

    ## Feature Engineering
    # We're using OneHotEncoder for categorical features and OrdinalEncoder for ordinal features.

    ## Model Selection
    # We're using cross-validation to select the best model.

    ## Model Deployment
    # We're using a simple pipeline to deploy the model.
