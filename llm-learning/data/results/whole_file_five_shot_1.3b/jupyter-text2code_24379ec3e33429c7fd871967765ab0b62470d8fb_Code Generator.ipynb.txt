    The commit message "Rename plugin from mopp to text2code" is a rename operation. It means that the name of the plugin "mopp" has been changed to "text2code".

    The original code was using the "mopp" plugin, which is a Python library for generating code snippets from a given Python code. The "text2code" plugin is a Python library for generating code snippets from a given Python code.

    The "rename" operation is a common operation in software development, and it's used to change the name of a module, function, class, or other identifiers in the code.

    However, the provided code does not seem to be using any of these identifiers. It seems to be using the "CodeGenerator" class and its "generate_code" method to generate code snippets. If you want to rename the "CodeGenerator" class or the "generate_code" method, you would need to do so in the code.

    If you want to rename the "CodeGenerator" class, you would need to change the name of the class in the code. For example, you might change "CodeGenerator" to "Text2CodeGenerator".

    If you want to rename the "generate_code" method, you would need to change the name of the method in the code. For example, you might change "generate_code" to "generate_text".

    If you want to rename the "mopp" plugin, you would need to change the name of the plugin in the code. The "mopp" plugin is not a built-in Python library, so you would not be able to change its name in the code.

    If you want to rename the "text2code" plugin, you would need to change the name of the plugin in the code. The "text2code" plugin is not a built-in Python library, so you would not be able to change its name in the code.

    Please note that renaming a library or a plugin in Python is not a common operation and may not be supported by all Python environments.
