    The commit message "Updated tutorials to support new Tab/Section interface" has been updated to reflect the new Tab/Section interface. The tutorials have been updated to include a new interface for tab/section navigation, which is a more user-friendly and visually appealing way to navigate through the different sections of the tutorial. This will make the tutorials more accessible to a wider audience.
