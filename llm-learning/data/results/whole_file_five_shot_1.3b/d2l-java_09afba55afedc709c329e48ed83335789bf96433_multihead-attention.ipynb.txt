    The commit message "Upgrade to 0.11.0 (#139)" indicates that the project is upgrading to the version 0.11.0 of the AI Deep Java Library (DJL). 

    The code cells in the commit message are related to the upgrade process. The first cell is a Maven configuration to use the Sonatype OSS Snapshot repository for Maven. The next few cells are loading various Maven dependencies. The last cell is a simple test of the `MultiHeadAttention` class from the DJL.

    The `MultiHeadAttention` class is a part of the AI Deep Java Library and it's used for multi-head attention mechanism. The class is defined with a number of parameters such as the number of hidden units, the number of heads, the dropout rate, and a boolean to indicate whether to use bias. The `forwardInternal` method is the main method of the class that performs the forward pass of the block.

    The last cell of the commit message is a simple test of the `MultiHeadAttention` class. It creates a new instance of the `MultiHeadAttention` class with the specified parameters, and then performs a forward pass on some input data. The output shape of the forward pass is printed to the console.

    Please note that the actual upgrade process and the changes made to the code will depend on the specific version of the AI Deep Java Library you are using.
