    The code you provided is a set of functions and cells that perform various tasks such as creating random weights, calculating the net input, predicting the class of an input, training a perceptron, generating data for a species, and visualizing the data.

    The code is divided into several cells, each of which performs a specific task. The first cell imports the necessary libraries and functions. The next few cells define the functions `random_weights`, `net_input`, `predict`, `fit`, and `species_generator`. These functions are used to create and train a perceptron model.

    The next few cells generate some data for a species and train a perceptron model on this data. The model is then used to predict the class of new, unseen data.

    The last few cells are used to visualize the data and the model's performance.

    The code also includes cells for shuffling the data, training the model with different learning rates, and evaluating the model's performance.

    The final cell is used to generate a chart that visualizes the data and the model's performance.

    The code is well-structured and follows the typical structure of a Jupyter notebook.
