```
    The code you provided is a demonstration of how to use the DeepChecks library to perform a regression error distribution check on a Gradient Boosting Regressor model.

    Here's a breakdown of the code:

    - The first part of the code imports necessary libraries and modules.
    - The second part of the code loads the diabetes dataset from sklearn.datasets and splits it into a training set and a test set.
    - The third and fourth parts of the code create a Dataset object for the training and test sets.
    - The fifth and sixth parts of the code train a Gradient Boosting Regressor model on the training data and save it to the variable `clf`.
    - The seventh part of the code creates a RegressionErrorDistribution check and runs it on the test data and the trained model.
    - The eighth part of the code changes the labels of the test data to 150 and re-runs the check.

    The output of the check will provide a visualization of the distribution of regression errors made by the model.

    Please note that the DeepChecks library is a powerful tool for data analysis and model validation, but it requires a good understanding of machine learning and data science concepts.
