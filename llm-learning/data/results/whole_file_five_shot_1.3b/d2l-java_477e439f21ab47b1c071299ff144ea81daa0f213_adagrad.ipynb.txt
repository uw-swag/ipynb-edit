    The commit message "Upgrade to djl 0.13.0 (#176)" indicates a major version upgrade of the Deep Java Library (djl). 

    The djl is a machine learning library for Java that provides a high-level API for building and training machine learning models. The upgrade from djl 0.12.0 to 0.13.0 includes several changes and improvements.

    The most significant change in this version is the introduction of the `NDList` class, which is used to hold multiple NDArrays. This change allows for more efficient memory usage when dealing with large amounts of data.

    Another significant change is the introduction of the `Optimization` class, which contains the `adagrad` method, which is used to perform the actual optimization process. This method takes in a list of parameters and states, and updates the parameters based on the gradient and the learning rate.

    The `trainAdagrad` method in the `TrainingChapter11` class is updated to use the `adagrad` method for optimization. This change allows for more flexibility in how the optimization process is performed.

    The `trainConciseCh11` method in the `TrainingChapter11` class is also updated to use the `adagrad` optimizer. This change makes it easier to use the `adagrad` optimizer in a concise manner.

    The `lrt` and `adagrad` variables are also updated to use the `Tracker` and `Optimizer` classes, respectively. This change allows for more flexibility in how these variables are used.

    Overall, the upgrade to djl 0.13.0 includes several improvements and changes that make the library more efficient and user-friendly.
