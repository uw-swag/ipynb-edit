    The code you provided is a collection of Jupyter notebook cells. Each cell is designed to demonstrate a specific concept or operation in the Python programming language. Here's a brief explanation of what each cell does:

1. `<Cell_0>`: This cell imports the necessary libraries for the rest of the notebook.

2. `<Cell_1>`: This cell sets the environment variable for CUDA devices to use.

3. `<Cell_2>`: This cell performs a simple arithmetic operation.

4. `<Cell_3>`: This cell performs a more complex arithmetic operation.

5. `<Cell_4>`: This cell configures a TensorFlow session to run operations in a single thread.

6. `<Cell_5>`: This cell configures a TensorFlow session to run operations in a single thread.

7. `<Cell_6>`: This cell checks if a specific environment variable is set.

8. `<Cell_7>`: This cell sets a random seed for the random number generator.

9. `<Cell_8>`: This cell generates a random number.

10. `<Cell_9>`: This cell generates two random numbers.

11. `<Cell_10>`: This cell sets a random seed for the random number generator.

12. `<Cell_11>`: This cell creates a new TensorFlow session and runs a computation in that session.

13. `<Cell_12>`: This cell creates a new TensorFlow session and runs a computation in that session.

14. `<Cell_13>`: This cell creates a new TensorFlow session and runs a computation in that session.

15. `<Cell_14>`: This cell clears the TensorFlow default graph and sets a random seed for the random number generator.

16. `<Cell_15>`: This cell creates a new TensorFlow session and runs a computation in that session.

17. `<Cell_16>`: This cell creates a new TensorFlow session and runs a computation in that session.

18. `<Cell_17>`: This cell sets a random seed for the random number generator.
