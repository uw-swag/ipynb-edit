    The code you've provided is a demonstration of how to load and preprocess data, train a model, and evaluate its performance. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    1. The code imports necessary libraries and modules.
    2. It loads the training and test data from the specified paths.
    3. It creates a figure and a set of subplots.
    4. It displays a few examples of training and test images from the ColorMNIST dataset.
    5. It saves the figure as a png file.
    6. It loads the trained models from a specified folder and stores their performance metrics in a pandas DataFrame.
    7. It defines a function to test the performance of a model on a validation set.
    8. It trains the model and calculates the test accuracy for each model.
    9. Finally, it prints the performance metrics of all models.

    Please note that the code is incomplete and may not work as expected. It's recommended to run it in a proper environment to see the results.
