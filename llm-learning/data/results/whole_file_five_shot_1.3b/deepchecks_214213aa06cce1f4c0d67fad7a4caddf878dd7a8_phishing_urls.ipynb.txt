# ## Overview

This project is about using the MMTF (Multiple Model Testing Framework) library to process URL data. The MMTF library is a Python library that allows for the analysis of molecular modeling data. The project is divided into several steps, each of which involves a specific task.

# ## Getting Started

To get started, you need to install the necessary libraries. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
!{sys.executable} -m pip install pyspark
!{sys.executable} -m pip install mmtfPyspark
!{sys.executable} -m pip install deepchecks
!{sys.executable} -m pip install numpy pandas sklearn deepchecks
```

# ## Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The first step involves loading the URL data and performing some basic preprocessing. This includes converting the 'scrape_date' column to a datetime format, dropping unnecessary columns, and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Feature Scaling**: The next step involves scaling the features to a standard range. This is necessary because many machine learning algorithms perform better when features are on the same scale.

3. **Model Training**: The project then trains a logistic regression model on the preprocessed data. The model is then evaluated using the test data.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The final step involves evaluating the model's performance using the same test data.

# ## Future Work

The project is currently under development and there are many features that could be added in the future. Some potential future work could include:

- Implementing more complex feature selection methods.
- Improving the model's performance.
- Adding more advanced preprocessing steps.
- Implementing more complex model architectures.
