    [Automatic] Examples Update (#535)

    The commit includes the following changes:

    1. The `DatasetSizeComparison` class has been updated to include a new method `run`. This method compares the sizes of the train and test datasets.

    2. A new check result is returned which includes the sizes of the train and test datasets.

    3. A new function `graph_display` is added to the `DatasetSizeComparison` class. This function creates a bar graph to visualize the sizes of the train and test datasets.

    4. The `run` method of the `DatasetSizeComparison` class now returns a CheckResult object which includes the sizes of the train and test datasets and a display function to visualize the sizes.

    5. The `run` method of the `DatasetSizeComparison` class is called with dummy datasets for demonstration purposes.

    6. The result of the `run` method is displayed in the notebook.

    The commit also includes a new cell with the updated code.
