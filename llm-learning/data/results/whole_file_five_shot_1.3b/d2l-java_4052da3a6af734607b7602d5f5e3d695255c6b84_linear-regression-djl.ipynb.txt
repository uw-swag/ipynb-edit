    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses Maven to manage dependencies and load Java classes. The dependencies are specified in the first cell of the notebook, and the classes are loaded from a file named "DataPoints.java" and "Training.java".

    The next few cells load these classes and create a synthetic dataset for training. The synthetic dataset is then iterated over, and the model's parameters are updated in each iteration.

    After training, the model's parameters are printed out. The model is saved to a directory named "lin-reg" in the "models" directory.

    The last cell of the notebook is the model's prediction for a single example.
