    The provided code cells are updating the sample notebooks to remove future warnings. Future warnings are warnings that are not relevant to the current version of the code. However, the code itself is not changing the future warnings, it's just removing them.

    Here's the updated code:

    ```python
    try:
        import evidently
    except:
        !pip install git+https://github.com/evidentlyai/evidently.git

    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np

    from sklearn import datasets, ensemble, model_selection

    from evidently import ColumnMapping
    from evidently.test_suite import TestSuite

    from evidently.test_preset import NoTargetPerformanceTestPreset
    from evidently.test_preset import DataQualityTestPreset
    from evidently.test_preset import DataStabilityTestPreset
    from evidently.test_preset import DataDriftTestPreset
    from evidently.test_preset import RegressionTestPreset
    from evidently.test_preset import MulticlassClassificationTestPreset
    from evidently.test_preset import BinaryClassificationTestPreset
    from evidently.test_preset import BinaryClassificationTopKTestPreset

    #... rest of the code
    ```

    This code will install the `evidently` package if it's not already installed, and then import the necessary libraries and presets.
