```python
    # The Deepchecks library is used to visualize and analyze data.
    # The SpecialCharacters check is used to identify and count special characters in the data.

    # Here is an example of how to use the SpecialCharacters check:

    from deepchecks.checks import SpecialCharacters

    # Run the check on the dataframe
    result = SpecialCharacters().run(dataframe)

    # Print the result
    print(result)
    ```

    This will display the count of special characters in each column of the dataframe.
