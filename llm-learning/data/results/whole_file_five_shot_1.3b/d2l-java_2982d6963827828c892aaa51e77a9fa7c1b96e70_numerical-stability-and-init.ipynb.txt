The provided code cells seem to be related to Maven and Java development, specifically with the ai.djl library. Here's a brief explanation of the changes:

1. The first cell is a configuration for Maven repository. It's a list of repositories, each with a URL and a snapshot version.

2. The second cell is a Maven dependency declaration. It's for loading a specific version of a library (`ai.djl`) from a Maven repository.

3. The third cell is a dependency loading from a local file. It's for loading a Java file (`DataPoints.java`, `Training.java`) from the local file system.

4. The fourth cell is a Java code snippet. It's for importing necessary Java libraries, creating a `NDManager`, and performing some operations on it.

5. The fifth cell is a code snippet that demonstrates how to use the `NDManager` to create a random matrix of a specific shape, and then multiplies it by itself 100 times.

6. The last cell is a code snippet that demonstrates how to use the `Engine` to compute the gradient of a function.

Please note that the code snippets are written in a specific language (Java) and use a specific library (`ai.djl`). The exact changes will depend on the specifics of the project and the libraries used.
