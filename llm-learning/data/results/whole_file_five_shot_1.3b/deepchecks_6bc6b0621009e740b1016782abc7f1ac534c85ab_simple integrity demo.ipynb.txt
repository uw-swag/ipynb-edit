    The commit message "[MLC-153] new dataset column type (#214)" suggests that a new column type has been added to the dataset. The new column type is not specified in the original code, but it's likely to be a new data type.

    The original code is not provided, but based on the provided context, it seems like the dataset is being loaded from the sklearn.datasets module, and the 'return_X_y=False, as_frame=True' parameters are used to load the dataset as a pandas DataFrame.

    The new column type could be a new data type, such as a new categorical or numerical feature, or it could be a new feature that has been added to the dataset.

    The 'integrity_suite().run()' function is used to check the integrity of the dataset. This function is part of the deepchecks library, and it's used to check the integrity of the dataset.

    If the new column type is a new categorical or numerical feature, the 'integrity_suite().run()' function will check if the new column type is consistent with the existing data types. If the new column type is not consistent, the function will return a list of inconsistencies.

    If the new column type is a new feature that has been added to the dataset, the 'integrity_suite().run()' function will check if the new column type is consistent with the existing features. If the new column type is not consistent, the function will return a list of inconsistencies.

    If the new column type is not specified in the original code, it's likely that the new column type is a new feature that has been added to the dataset.

    If the new column type is a new data type, it could be a new feature that has been added to the dataset.
