The code you provided is for a machine learning project using the Deep Java Library (DJL) and MXNet. The project involves training a model to predict the price of airfoils using a dataset. The code includes importing necessary libraries, loading data, defining functions, and training a model.

The code has several issues that need to be fixed:

1. The `%maven` commands are not valid in the provided code. Maven is a build automation tool used for Java projects. The `%maven` directive is used to add a Maven dependency to the project. However, it's not a valid directive in this context.

2. The `NDManager` class is not defined in the provided code. It's used to create and manage NDArrays.

3. The `NDList` class is not defined in the provided code. It's used to hold a list of NDArrays.

4. The `initRmsPropStates` method is not defined in the provided code. It's used to initialize the states for the RMSProp optimization.

5. The `Optimization` class is not defined in the provided code. It's used to define the RMSProp optimization.

6. The `trainRmsProp` method is not defined in the provided code. It's used to train the model using RMSProp.

7. The `LearningRateTracker` class is not defined in the provided code. It's used to track the learning rate during the training process.

8. The `Optimizer` class is not defined in the provided code. It's used to define the RMSProp optimizer.

9. The `TrainingChapter11` class is not defined in the provided code. It's used to define the training process.

10. The `trainConciseCh11` method is not defined in the provided code. It's used to train the model using a concise training process.

11. The `getDataCh11` method is not defined in the provided code. It's used to get the data for the training process.

12. The `LossTime` class is not defined in the provided code. It's used to store the training time and loss.
