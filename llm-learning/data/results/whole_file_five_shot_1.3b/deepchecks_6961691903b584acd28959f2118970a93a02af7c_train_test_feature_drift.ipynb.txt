    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook that uses the Deepchecks library to perform a feature drift check on a dataset. The notebook includes imports, data generation, and a feature drift check. The notebook also includes a condition for the check to be applied, and a pprint of the conditions.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The code imports necessary libraries and modules.
    - It generates random data for training and testing.
    - It converts the data to a pandas DataFrame.
    - It applies a feature transformation to the data, including handling of categorical features and numerical features.
    - It fits a decision tree model to the data.
    - It performs a feature drift check on the data.
    - It prints the result of the check.
    - It adds a condition to the check to only include features with a drift score not greater than a certain value.
    - It applies the condition to the check and prints the result.

    The code is a good example of how to use the Deepchecks library to perform feature drift checks in a Jupyter notebook.

    Please note that the Deepchecks library is not installed in this environment, so you need to install it using pip:

    ```
    pip install deepchecks
    ```

    Also, please note that the code is a simple example and may not work as expected in all scenarios. It's always a good idea to test your code with different data and configurations to ensure it works as expected.
