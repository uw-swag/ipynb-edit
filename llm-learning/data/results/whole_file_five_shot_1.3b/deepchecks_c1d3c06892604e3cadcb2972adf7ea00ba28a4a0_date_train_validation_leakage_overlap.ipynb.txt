    The code above is an example of how to use the Deepchecks library to detect and handle leakage in a training dataset. The code creates a training and a test dataset, and then runs a check to detect any leakage in the training dataset.

    The check `DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap` is used to detect any overlap between the training and test datasets. If there is any overlap, the check will return a warning.

    The code also demonstrates how to create a test dataset with a leakage in the future dates.

    Please note that the Deepchecks library is not installed in this environment, so the code will not run.

    If you want to use the Deepchecks library, you can install it using pip:

    ```
    pip install deepchecks
    ```

    Then, you can run the code in your local environment.
