    The code you've provided is a basic implementation of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) chatbot using a logistic regression model. Here's a brief explanation of what each part of the code does:

    1. Import necessary libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, and LogisticRegression from sklearn.

    2. Load the dataset.

    3. Split the dataset into features (X) and target variable (Y).

    4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

    5. Train a logistic regression model on the training data.

    6. Print the accuracy of the model on both the training and testing sets.

    7. Make predictions on the testing set.

    8. Create a confusion matrix and a heatmap to visualize the confusion matrix.

    9. Print the recall, precision, F1-score, and a classification report.

    10. Print the accuracy score of the model.

    11. The code doesn't seem to have any issues, but it's worth noting that the code is quite basic and may not work as expected if the dataset is not properly preprocessed or if the features are not suitable for the model.

    Please note that this is a basic implementation and may not be suitable for a production environment. For a more advanced NLP chatbot, you may need to use more advanced techniques such as deep learning, word embeddings, or transformers.
