    The code provided is a Deepchecks example. The examples update is a process to clean and analyze the dataset. The code is updating the dataset by removing the ambiguous labels.

    The `LabelAmbiguity` check is a Deepchecks check that identifies and removes labels that are ambiguous. The `run` method is used to execute the check on a dataset.

    The `n_to_show` parameter is used to specify the number of examples to show.

    The `columns` parameter is used to specify the columns to consider for the check.

    The `clean_dataset` is a new dataset with the ambiguous labels removed.

    The `LabelAmbiguity().run(clean_dataset)` will execute the check on the `clean_dataset` and show the results.
