    The GitHub action is fixed by adding a new step to the workflow file. The new step is to run the deepchecks version of the code. The new step is added in the 'actions' section of the workflow file.

    The new step is:

    ```yaml
    - name: Run deepchecks
      run: |
        !{sys.executable} -m deepchecks run --all
    ```

    This will run the deepchecks version of the code and display the results.
