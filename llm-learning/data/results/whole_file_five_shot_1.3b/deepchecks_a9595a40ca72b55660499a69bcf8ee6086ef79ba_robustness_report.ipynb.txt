```python
    # The commit message "fixing docs (#898)" is a fix for a documentation issue.
    # The code block in the commit message is a part of the documentation for a function or class.
    # The function or class is 'RobustnessReport', and the issue is related to the 'add_condition_degradation_not_greater_than' method.
    # The 'add_condition_degradation_not_greater_than' method is used to add a condition to the RobustnessReport to check if the model's prediction is not greater than 0.05.
    # The function or class is then run with the 'mnist_dataloader_test' and 'model' to generate a report.
    # The report is then displayed using the 'show' method.
