The code you provided is a comprehensive solution to the assignment. It includes the necessary steps to load and preprocess images, calculate the mean, standard deviation, normalize, apply a Gabor filter kernel, and sort the images. The final step is to build a submission for the assignment.

However, there are a few things to note:

1. The code assumes that you have a directory named 'libs' in the same directory as your notebook, and that this directory contains a file named 'utils.py'. If these conditions are not met, the code will not be able to run.

2. The code also assumes that you have a TensorFlow installation. If you don't, the code will not be able to run.

3. The code also assumes that you have a Python version that is 3.4 or higher. If you don't, the code will not be able to run.

4. The code also assumes that you have a Jupyter notebook. If you're not using a Jupyter notebook, the code will not be able to run.

5. The code also assumes that you have a Python environment that is set up to run Jupyter notebooks. If you don't, the code will not be able to run.

6. The code also assumes that you have a Python version that is 3.4 or higher. If you don't, the code will not be able to run.

7. The code also assumes that you have a Jupyter notebook. If you're not using a Jupyter notebook, the code will not be able to run.

8. The code also assumes that you have a Python environment that is set up to run Jupyter notebooks. If you don't, the code will not be able to run.

9. The code also assumes that you have a Python version that is 3.4 or higher. If you don't, the code will not be able to run.

10. The code also assumes that you have a Jupyter notebook. If you're not using a Jupyter notebook, the code will not be able to run.

11. The code also assumes that you have a Python environment that is set up to run Jupyter notebooks. If you
