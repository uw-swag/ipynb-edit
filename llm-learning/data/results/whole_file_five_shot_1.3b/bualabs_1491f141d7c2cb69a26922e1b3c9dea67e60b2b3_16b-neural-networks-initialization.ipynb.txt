    The code you've provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the Keras library to implement a simple neural network for image classification. The notebook includes a number of cells that are used to load and preprocess the data, define the architecture of the network, train the network, and evaluate its performance.

    The code also includes cells that are used to normalize the data, implement the ReLU activation function, and implement the sigmoid activation function. The code also includes cells that are used to implement the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function, and to implement the gradient descent optimization algorithm.

    The code also includes cells that are used to implement the Kaiming initialization, which is a method used to initialize the weights of a neural network. The code also includes cells that are used to implement the model, which is a class that defines the architecture of the network and the training process.

    The code also includes cells that are used to implement the Elbow method for selecting the number of hidden units in the network, and to implement the gain parameter for the Kaiming initialization.

    The code also includes cells that are used to implement the gain parameter for the Kaiming initialization, and to implement the gain parameter for the Kaiming initialization.
