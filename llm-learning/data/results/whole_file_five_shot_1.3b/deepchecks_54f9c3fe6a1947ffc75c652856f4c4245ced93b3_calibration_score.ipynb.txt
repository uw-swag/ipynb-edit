    The code you've provided is a series of examples and updates for a DeepChecks check. Here's a brief explanation of what each section does:

    1. The first section imports necessary libraries and sets up the environment.
    2. The second section defines a custom formatwarning function, which is used to ignore warnings in the code.
    3. The third section downloads a dataset from a URL and decodes it.
    4. The fourth section encodes categorical features and splits the data into training and testing sets.
    5. The fifth section creates a pipeline for preprocessing the data, fits a logistic regression model, and then runs the calibration score check.
    6. The sixth section loads the iris dataset, creates a logistic regression model, and runs the calibration score check.
    7. The seventh section defines a custom function to calculate the calibration score.
    8. The eighth section runs the calibration score check on the test data and the model.
    9. The ninth section defines a custom function to calculate the calibration score.
    10. The tenth section runs the calibration score check on the test data and the model.

    The code is designed to run a calibration score check on a logistic regression model and a custom function.
