    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the AutoMLOps library to automate machine learning workflows. The notebook includes several components that perform different tasks such as creating a dataset, training a model, and deploying the model.

    The components are defined in separate Python files (`create_dataset.py`, `train_model.py`, and `deploy_model.py`). These components are then imported and used in the main pipeline (`pipeline.py`) to define the workflow.

    The pipeline parameters are defined in a dictionary (`pipeline_params`) and passed to the `AutoMLOps.go` function to run the pipeline.

    The pipeline is designed to run at a schedule specified by the `schedule` parameter. The schedule is set to run every 12 hours.

    The notebook also includes a section at the end of the notebook that defines the pipeline and the pipeline parameters.
