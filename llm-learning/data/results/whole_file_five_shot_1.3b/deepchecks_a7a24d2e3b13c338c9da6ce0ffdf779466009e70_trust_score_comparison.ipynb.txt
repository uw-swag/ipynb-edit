```
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
    from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from deepchecks import Dataset

    df = load_breast_cancer(as_frame=True).frame
    label = 'target'

    train_df, test_df = train_test_split(df, test_size=0.33, random_state=0)
    train = Dataset(train_df, label=label)
    test = Dataset(test_df, label=label)

    clf = AdaBoostClassifier()
    features = train_df.drop(label, axis=1)
    target = train_df[label]
    clf.fit(features, target)

    from deepchecks.checks import TrustScoreComparison

    TrustScoreComparison(min_test_samples=100).run(train, test, clf)
    ```

    The code above is an example of how to use the Deepchecks library to compare the trust score of the AdaBoostClassifier with the test data. The trust score is a measure of the model's ability to make accurate predictions, and it's a good metric to evaluate the model's performance.
