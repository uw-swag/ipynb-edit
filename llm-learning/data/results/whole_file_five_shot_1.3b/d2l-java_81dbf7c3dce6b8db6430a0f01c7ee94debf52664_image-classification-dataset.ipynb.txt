    The code you provided seems to be a mix of Maven and Java code, and it seems to be a part of a larger project. Here's a brief explanation of what each section of code does:

    1. `<Cell_0>` and `<Cell_1>`: These are cell headers. They define the dependencies that will be used in the notebook.

    2. `<Cell_2>`: This cell is loading a Java class from a file named `StopWatch.java`.

    3. `<Cell_3>`: This cell is importing the necessary classes from the `ai.djl` package.

    4. `<Cell_4>`: This cell is creating two `RandomAccessDataset` objects, `mnistTrain` and `mnistTest`, which are used to train and test the model.

    5. `<Cell_5>`: This cell is printing the size of the training and testing datasets.

    6. `<Cell_6>`: This cell is defining two methods, `getFashionMnistLabels` and `getFashionMnistLabel`, which are used to convert integer labels to text labels.

    7. `<Cell_7>`: This cell is defining a `ImagePanel` class, which is a custom JPanel that scales an image and draws it.

    8. `<Cell_8>`: This cell is defining a `Container` class, which is a custom JPanel that displays two labels side by side.

    9. `<Cell_9>`: This cell is importing the `FashionMnistUtils` class and using it to display some images.

    10. `<Cell_10>`: This cell is defining some constants and variables.

    11. `<Cell_11>`: This cell is starting a stopwatch and running a loop over the training dataset.

    12. `<Cell_12>`: This cell is printing the elapsed time of the training process.

    Please note that the code you provided is incomplete and may not work as expected. It's also missing some parts, such as the definition of the `FashionMnist` class and the definition of the `getDataset` method.
