    The code you provided is a demonstration of multiple linear regression using Python's scikit-learn library. The code first imports necessary libraries and loads a dataset, then it creates a scatter plot of the 'ENGINESIZE' and 'CO2EMISSIONS' variables. 

    The code then splits the dataset into a training set and a test set. The training set is used to train the linear regression model, and the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

    The code then repeats the process for a second linear regression model, this time using the 'ENGINESIZE', 'CYLINDERS', 'FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB', and 'CO2EMISSIONS' variables. The model's coefficients and residual sum of squares are printed.

    The code also repeats the process for a third linear regression model, this time using the 'ENGINESIZE', 'CYLINDERS', 'FUELCONSUMPTION_CITY', 'FUELCONSUMPTION_HWY', and 'CO2EMISSIONS' variables. The model's coefficients and residual sum of squares are printed.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the `fit` method of the linear regression model to train the model, and how to use the `predict` method to make predictions.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the `score` method of the linear regression model to evaluate the model's performance.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the `coef_` attribute of the linear regression model to get the coefficients of the model.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the `mean` function to calculate the mean squared error of the model's predictions.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the `rjust` method of the string class to right-justify a string in a column of text.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the `values` method of the DataFrame class to get the values of a DataFrame.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the `in` operator to check if a value is in a list.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the `split` method of the string class to split a string into a list of words.
