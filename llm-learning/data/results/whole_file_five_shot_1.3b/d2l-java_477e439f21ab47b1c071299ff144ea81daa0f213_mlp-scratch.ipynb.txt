    The commit message "Upgrade to djl 0.13.0 (#176)" is updating the code to use the latest version of the Deep Java Library (djl). The djl is a machine learning library for Java that provides a high-level API for building and training machine learning models. The version 0.13.0 is a minor update that includes several bug fixes and improvements.

    The code cells are as follows:

    - Cell_0: This cell is importing the necessary libraries and modules for the code.

    - Cell_1: This cell is importing the djl imports.

    - Cell_2: This cell is preparing the training and test datasets for the model.

    - Cell_3: This cell is defining the weights and biases for the neural network.

    - Cell_4: This cell is defining the ReLU function.

    - Cell_5: This cell is defining the net function, which is the forward pass of the model.

    - Cell_6: This cell is defining the loss function.

    - Cell_7: This cell is initializing variables for the training process.

    - Cell_8: This cell is running the training process.

    - Cell_9: This cell is rendering a line plot of the training and test loss over epochs.

    The line plot shows the training loss and accuracy over epochs, and the test accuracy.

    Please note that the code is written in Java and uses the djl library.
