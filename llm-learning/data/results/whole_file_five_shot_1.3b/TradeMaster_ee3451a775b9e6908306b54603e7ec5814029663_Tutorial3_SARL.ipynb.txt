    The code you provided seems to be a PyTorch script for training a model on a dataset. However, it contains several bugs that need to be fixed. Here are some suggestions:

1. The `build_dataset` function is not defined in the code you provided. You need to define it to build the dataset according to the configuration in the `cfg` object.

2. The `build_trainer` function is not defined in the code you provided. You need to define it to build the trainer according to the configuration in the `cfg` object.

3. The `trainer.train_and_valid()` and `trainer.test()` calls are not indented correctly. The indentation should be consistent with the function calls.

4. The `cfg.dump(osp.join(work_dir, osp.basename(args.config)))` line is not indented correctly. The indentation should be consistent with the function call.

5. The `parse_args()` function is not indented correctly. The indentation should be consistent with the function call.

6. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` line is not indented correctly. The indentation should be consistent with the function call.

7. The `ROOT` variable is not defined in the code you provided. You need to define it to get the root directory of the project.

8. The `replace_cfg_vals` function is not defined in the code you provided. You need to define it to replace the values in the configuration with the values from the command line arguments.

9. The `argparse.ArgumentParser` is not indented correctly. The indentation should be consistent with the function call.

10. The `build_trainer` function is not indented correctly. The indentation should be consistent with the function call.

11. The `trainer.train_and_valid()` and `trainer.test()` calls are not indented correctly. The indentation should be consistent with the function calls.

12. The `cfg.dump(osp.join(work_dir, osp.basename(args.config)))` line is not indented correctly. The indentation should be consistent with the function call.
