```python
    <Cell_0>
    from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

    knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
    knn.fit(Xtrain, ytrain)
    ypred = knn.predict(Xtest)
    <\Cell_0>
    <Cell_1>
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

    accuracy = accuracy_score(ytest, ypred)
    print("Accuracy: ", accuracy)
    <\Cell_1>
    ```
    The above code will train a KNN model on the training data and then predict the labels for the test data. The accuracy of the model is then calculated and printed.
