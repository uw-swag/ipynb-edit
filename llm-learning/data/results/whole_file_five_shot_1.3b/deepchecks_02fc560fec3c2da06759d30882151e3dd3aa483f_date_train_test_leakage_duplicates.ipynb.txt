The code you provided is a test for the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check in the `deepchecks` library. The `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check is used to detect duplicates in the training and test datasets.

The first part of the code creates two datasets, `train_ds` and `test_ds`, with a datetime column `col1`. The second part of the code creates a `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check, and runs it on the `train_ds` and `test_ds` datasets.

The `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check will then show the top 3 duplicates in the training dataset, and the duplicates in the test dataset.

The second part of the code creates a `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check, but this time it does not specify the number of duplicates to show. The check will then show all duplicates in the training dataset, and the duplicates in the test dataset.

The output of these tests should provide a clear indication of whether the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check is working as expected.
