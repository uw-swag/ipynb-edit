    The code you provided is for a Jupyter notebook and it seems to be a part of a larger project. However, it's not clear what the purpose of this code is. It seems to be a part of a data analysis project, where a new feature drift check is performed. 

    If you're looking to perform a feature drift check, you would need to replace the code in the cell with the actual code for performing the feature drift check.
