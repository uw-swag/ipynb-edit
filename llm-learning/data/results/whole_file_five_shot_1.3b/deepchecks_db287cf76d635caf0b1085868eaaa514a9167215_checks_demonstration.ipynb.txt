    The code you've provided is a set of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how to perform various checks on a dataset. These checks are performed using the `mlchecks` library, which is a Python package for checking the integrity, leakage, and performance of machine learning datasets.

    Here's a brief overview of what each cell does:

    1. `<Cell_0>`: This cell imports the necessary libraries.

    2. `<Cell_1>`: This cell sets the base directory for the datasets.

    3. `<Cell_2>`: This cell lists all the datasets in the base directory.

    4. `<Cell_3>`: This cell defines the paths to the datasets.

    5. `<Cell_4>`: This cell reads the training and validation datasets.

    6. `<Cell_5>`: This cell defines the metrics to be evaluated.

    7. `<Cell_6>`: This cell imports the necessary models for the checks.

    8. `<Cell_7>`: This cell imports the `Dataset` class from the `mlchecks` library.

    9. `<Cell_8>`: This cell imports the `dataset_info`, `model_info`, `feature_importance`, and `performance_report` functions from the `mlchecks` library.

    10. `<Cell_9>`: This cell imports the `RareFormatDetection` class from the `mlchecks.checks.integrity` module.

    11. `<Cell_10>`: This cell imports the `DataDuplicates`, `DominantFrequencyChange`, `IsSingleValue`, `MixedNulls`, `MixedTypes`, `NewCategoryTrainTest`, `NewLabelTrainTest`, `RareFormatDetection`, `StringLengthOutlier`, `StringMismatch`, `StringMismatchComparison` classes from the `mlchecks.checks.integrity` module.

    12. `<Cell_11>`: This cell imports the `DataSampleLeakageReport`, `DateTrainTestLeakageOverlap`, `DateTrainTest
