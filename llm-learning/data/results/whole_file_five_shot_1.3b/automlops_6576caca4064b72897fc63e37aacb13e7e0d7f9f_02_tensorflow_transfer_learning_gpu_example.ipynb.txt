    This is a basic documentation for the code. The code is a machine learning pipeline that uses TensorFlow and Google Cloud AutoML Operations to train a model. The pipeline includes a custom training component, a pipeline function, and a launch function. The pipeline function is used to launch the AutoML Operations pipeline.

    The pipeline function takes parameters for the project ID, model directory, learning rate, number of epochs, number of steps, serving image, and distribution strategy. The pipeline function then uses these parameters to launch the AutoML Operations pipeline.

    The launch function is used to launch the AutoML Operations pipeline. It takes parameters for the project ID, model directory, learning rate, number of epochs, number of steps, serving image, and distribution strategy. The launch function is used to launch the AutoML Operations pipeline.

    The pipeline parameters are set in a dictionary called `pipeline_params`. This dictionary is then passed to the `AutoMLOps.launchAll` function to launch the AutoML Operations pipeline.

    The `AutoMLOps.launchAll` function is used to launch the AutoML Operations pipeline. It takes parameters for the project ID, model directory, learning rate, number of epochs, number of steps, serving image, and distribution strategy. The `AutoMLOps.launchAll` function is used to launch the AutoML Operations pipeline.

    The `AutoMLOps.launchAll` function is used to launch the AutoML Operations pipeline. It takes parameters for the project ID, model directory, learning rate, number of epoch
