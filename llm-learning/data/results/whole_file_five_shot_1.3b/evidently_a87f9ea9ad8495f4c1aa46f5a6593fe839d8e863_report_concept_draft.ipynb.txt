    The code you provided is a rework of the `TargetDriftPreset` in the `evidently` library. The `TargetDriftPreset` is a class that provides a set of default metrics for target drift. The `remove_old_target_drift_presets` method is removed as it's not a part of the `evidently` library.

    The code also includes examples of how to use the `DataDriftPreset`, `DataQuality`, `NumTargetDrift`, `RegressionPerformance`, `ClassificationPerformance`, and `CatTargetDrift` presets. These presets are used to measure the quality of the data and identify potential issues with target drift.

    The code also includes examples of how to run these presets on datasets and generate reports. The `run` method is used to generate a report, and the `save_html`, `save_json`, and `as_dict` methods are used to save the report as an HTML, JSON, and dictionary respectively.

    The code also includes examples of how to generate a report in JSON format.

    The code also includes examples of how to generate a report in a dictionary format.
