    The code provided is a basic example of how to use the DeepChecks library to perform a calibration check on a logistic regression model. The DeepChecks library is a Python library for visualizing and comparing different machine learning models.

    The `CalibrationMetric` class in DeepChecks is used to check the calibration of a model. It measures the calibration of a model by comparing the model's predictions to the true labels.

    The `run` method of the `CalibrationMetric` class is used to perform the calibration check. It takes a `Dataset` object and a model as input, and returns a `CalibrationMetricResult` object.

    The `run` method uses the model to predict the labels of the dataset, and then compares the predicted labels to the true labels. It calculates various calibration metrics, such as the calibration coefficient and the number of calibration points.

    The code also shows how to load the iris dataset and train a logistic regression model.

    Please note that you need to have the DeepChecks library installed in your environment to run this code. You can install it using pip:

    ```
    pip install deepchecks
    ```
