    # Merging data processing into one notebook and updating the existing notebooks accordingly

    ## Data Processing
    # The data processing step includes loading the SAR data, creating spy data, training a logistic regression model, and using a Naive Bayes classifier to predict the test data.

    ## Updating Existing Notebooks
    # The existing notebooks have been updated to include the data processing step. The notebooks have been updated to include the data processing step, the logistic regression model, the Naive Bayes classifier, and the plotting functions.

    ## Note:
    # The notebooks have been updated to include the data processing step, the logistic regression model, the Naive Bayes classifier, and the plotting functions.

    ## Code:
    # The code has been updated to include the data processing step, the logistic regression model, the Naive Bayes classifier, and the plotting functions.

    ## Explanation:
