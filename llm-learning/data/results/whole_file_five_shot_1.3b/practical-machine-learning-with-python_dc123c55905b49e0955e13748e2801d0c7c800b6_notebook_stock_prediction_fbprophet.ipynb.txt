    The commit message "removing useless git LFS" is not related to the code cells provided. However, it's a good practice to remove unnecessary files like .gitignore, .lfsconfig, and LFS files from your repository. This is to keep the repository size small and to avoid unnecessary clutter.

    Here's the code:

    ```python
    # Remove .gitignore and .lfsconfig
    os.remove('.gitignore')
    os.remove('.lfsconfig')

    # Remove LFS files
    shutil.rmtree('.lfs', ignore_errors=True)
    ```

    This code will remove the .gitignore, .lfsconfig, and LFS files from your repository.
