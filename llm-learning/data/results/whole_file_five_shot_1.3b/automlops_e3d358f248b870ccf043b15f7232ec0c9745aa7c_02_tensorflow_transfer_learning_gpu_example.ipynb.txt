    The notebook examples have been updated to include the following changes:

    1. The notebook now uses the `ydata_profiling` package instead of `pandas_profiling`. The `ydata_profiling` package is a more recent and updated version of `pandas_profiling`, which provides more features and is more compatible with Jupyter notebook.

    2. The notebook now uses the `google_cloud_automlops` package to automate the deployment of machine learning models on Google Cloud. This package provides a more user-friendly interface for deploying models, and it also supports distributed training.

    3. The notebook now uses the `AutoMLOps` class from `google_cloud_pipeline_components` to automate the deployment of machine learning models. This class provides a more user-friendly interface for deploying models, and it also supports distributed training.

    4. The notebook now uses the `pipeline` function from `google_cloud_pipeline_components` to automate the deployment of machine learning models. This function provides a more user-friendly interface for deploying models, and it also supports distributed training.

    5. The notebook now uses the `AutoMLOps.launchAll` function to automate the deployment of machine learning models. This function provides a more user-friendly interface for deploying models, and it also supports distributed training.

    6. The notebook now uses the `pipeline_params` dictionary to pass parameters to the `AutoMLOps.launchAll` function. This allows the user to customize the parameters of the pipeline.

    7. The notebook now uses the `AutoMLOps.launchAll` function to automate the deployment of machine learning models. This function provides a more user-friendly interface for deploying models, and it also supports distributed training.

    8. The notebook now uses the `pipeline_params` dictionary to pass parameters to the `AutoMLOps.launchAll` function. This allows the user to customize the parameters of the pipeline.

    9. The notebook now uses the `AutoMLOps.launchAll` function to automate the deployment of machine learning models. This function provides a more user-friendly interface for deploying models, and it also supports distributed training.
