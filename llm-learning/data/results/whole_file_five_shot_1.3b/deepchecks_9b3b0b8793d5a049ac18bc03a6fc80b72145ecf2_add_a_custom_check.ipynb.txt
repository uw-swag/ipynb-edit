    The commit message "Add descriptions to the section headers" is added to the code cells. The descriptions are as follows:

    1. The first cell is a class definition for a custom DeepChecks check, `DatasetSizeComparison`, which compares the sizes of the train and test datasets.
    2. The second cell imports the necessary libraries for this check.
    3. The third cell creates a dummy `train_dataset` and `test_dataset` using pandas DataFrame.
    4. The fourth cell runs the `DatasetSizeComparison` check on these datasets and returns the check result.
    5. The last cell displays the check result.

    The descriptions are added to the code cells to provide a brief explanation of what each part of the code does.
