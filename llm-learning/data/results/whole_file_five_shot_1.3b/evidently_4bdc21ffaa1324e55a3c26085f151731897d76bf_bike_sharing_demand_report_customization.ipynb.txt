```python
    import dash
    import dash_core_components as dcc
    import dash_html_components as html

    app = dash.Dash(__name__)

    app.layout = html.Div([
        html.H1('Dashboard'),
        dcc.Graph(
            id='example-graph',
            figure={
                'data': [
                    {'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [4, 1, 2], 'type': 'bar', 'name': 'SF'},
                    {'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [2, 4, 5], 'type': 'bar', 'name': 'NY'},
                ],
                'layout': {
                    'title': 'Dash Data Visualization'
                }
            }
        )
    ])

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run_server(debug=True)
    ```

    This is a simple example of a Dashboard customization. The Dash application is created with the `dash.Dash(__name__)` method. The layout of the application is defined with the `app.layout` method. The layout is a combination of HTML components and Dash components.

    The `html.H1` component is used to create a title, and the `dcc.Graph` component is used to create a graph. The `figure` attribute of the `dcc.Graph` component is a dictionary that contains the data and layout of the graph.

    The `if __name__ == '__main__':` line ensures that the application runs only when the script is run directly, not when it is imported as a module.

    The `app.run_server(debug=True)` line starts the development server. The `debug=True` argument enables debug mode, which automatically reloads the server when changes are made to the code.

    This is a very basic example and real-world applications would likely require more complex layouts and more complex data visualizations.
