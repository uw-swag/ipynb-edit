    The code you've provided is a series of operations that involve data cleaning, model training, and testing. Here's a brief overview of what each part of the code does:

    1. **Importing necessary libraries and modules**: The code imports several libraries and modules that are used in the project, such as numpy, matplotlib, torch, pandas, and others.

    2. **Setting random seed**: The code sets a random seed for reproducibility.

    3. **Loading and preparing the dataset**: The code loads the SST (Stanford Sentiment Treebank) dataset, which is a collection of sentences labeled as either 'positive' or 'negative'.

    4. **Defining a function to add decoy words to the sentences**: The function `get_decoy_dataset` takes a dataset and a decoy word as input, and adds a decoy word to a random subset of the sentences in the dataset.

    5. **Creating and saving the decoy datasets**: The code calls the `get_decoy_dataset` function to create decoy datasets for the positive and negative sentences, and then saves these datasets to a CSV file.

    6. **Training the model**: The code uses a LSTM model to train the model on the decoy datasets.

    7. **Testing the model**: The code uses the trained model to test the model on the test dataset.

    8. **Evaluating the model**: The code evaluates the model's performance using various metrics.

    9. **Visualizing the results**: The code visualizes the results of the model's performance.

    10. **Cleaning up**: The code cleans up the environment by removing unnecessary variables and files.

Please note that the code you've provided is a part of a larger project, and the actual functionality of the code will depend on the specifics of the project and the models used.
