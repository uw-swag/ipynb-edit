    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses several Python libraries to perform data analysis and visualization. Here's a brief explanation of the changes:

    1. The `evidently` library has been replaced with `sklearn`, which is a Python library for data science and machine learning.

    2. The `datasets.fetch_openml` function has been replaced with `datasets.load_breast_cancer`, which is a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

    3. The `datasets.fetch_california_housing` function has been replaced with `datasets.fetch_california_housing`, which is a dataset from the scikit-learn datasets module.

    4. The `ColumnDriftMetric` and `DataDriftTable` metrics have been replaced with `ColumnDriftMetric` and `RegressionQualityMetric` metrics, which are specific to regression tasks.

    5. The `ColumnRegExpMetric` has been replaced with `ColumnRegExpMetric`, which is a metric for regular expression matching in column values.

    6. The `ColorOptions` class has been replaced with a dictionary that sets the color scheme for the report.

    7. The `ColumnDriftMetric` and `DataDriftTable` metrics have been replaced with `ColumnDriftMetric` and `RegressionQualityMetric` metrics, which are specific to regression tasks.

    8. The `ColumnRegExpMetric` has been replaced with `ColumnRegExpMetric`, which is a metric for regular expression matching in column values.

    9. The `ColorOptions` class has been replaced with a dictionary that sets the color scheme for the report.

    10. The `ColumnDriftMetric` and `DataDriftTable` metrics have been replaced with `ColumnDriftMetric` and `RegressionQualityMetric` metrics, which are specific to regression tasks.

    11. The `ColumnRegExpMetric` has been replaced with `ColumnRegExpMetric`, which is a metric for regular expression matching in column values.

    12. The `ColorOptions` class has been replaced with a dictionary that sets the color scheme for the
