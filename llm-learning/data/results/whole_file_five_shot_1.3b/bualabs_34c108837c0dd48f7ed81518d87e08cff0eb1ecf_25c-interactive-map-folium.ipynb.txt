    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the geopandas, kaggle, pandas, folium, and other libraries to perform data analysis and visualization. 

    The issue you're facing is that the `iframe` is not being displayed correctly. The `iframe` is used to embed a web page within a web page. However, in the code you've provided, the `iframe` is not being displayed because the `embed_map` function is not defined. 

    To fix this issue, you need to define a function that can embed a folium map into an iframe. Here's a simple example of how you can do this:

    ```python
    from IPython.display import IFrame

    def embed_map(m, title="Map"):
        m.save('map.html')
        return IFrame(src='map.html', height=600, width=800)
    ```

    This function saves the map to a file named 'map.html', and then uses the `IFrame` function to embed this file into an iframe. The `height` and `width` parameters determine the size of the iframe.

    After defining this function, you can use it to embed the maps in your notebook:

    ```python
    m_1 = folium.Map(...)
    ...
    m_1.save('map.html')
    return IFrame(src='map.html', height=600, width=800)
    ```

    This will create an iframe that displays the map, and you can then embed this iframe in your notebook.
