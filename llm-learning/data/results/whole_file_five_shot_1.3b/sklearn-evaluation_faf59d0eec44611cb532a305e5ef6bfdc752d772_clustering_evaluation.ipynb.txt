    ## Clustering

    ## Clustering is a technique used to group similar items together.

    ## The main idea is to find the 'k' clusters in the data and then use the items in these clusters as a representative for the clusters.

    ## The algorithm used for clustering is K-means.

    ## The steps for clustering are:

    ### Step 1: Import necessary libraries
    ### Step 2: Load the data
    ### Step 3: Perform clustering
    ### Step 4: Visualize the clusters
    ```
