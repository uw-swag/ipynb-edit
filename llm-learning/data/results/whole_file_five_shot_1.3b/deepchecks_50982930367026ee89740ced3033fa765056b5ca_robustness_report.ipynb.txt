    # Improvement:
    # - The function `numpy_to_html_image` is not defined. It seems like it's a utility function used to convert numpy arrays to HTML images.
    # - The function `load_dataset` is not used in the code. It's not clear what it's used for.
    # - The function `load_model` is not used in the code. It's not clear what it's used for.
    # - The function `RobustnessReport` is not used in the code. It's not clear what it's used for.
    # - The function `add_condition_degradation_not_greater_than` is not used in the code. It's not clear what it's used for.
