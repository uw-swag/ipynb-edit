The function `new_label_train_validation` is used to check the integrity of the data. It compares the values in two datasets and returns a list of any discrepancies.

The function `new_label_train_validation` takes two arguments: `test` and `val`, which are instances of the `Dataset` class. The `Dataset` class is a data structure that holds a pandas DataFrame and a label.

The function first checks if the label in the `test` dataset is the same as the label in the `val` dataset. If they are not the same, it returns a list of discrepancies.

The function then checks if the values in the `test` dataset are the same as the values in the `val` dataset. If they are not the same, it returns a list of discrepancies.

Here is the modified code:

```python
from mlchecks.checks.integrity.new_label import new_label_train_validation
from mlchecks.base import Dataset
import pandas as pd

test_data = {"col1": [0, 1, 2, 3] * 10, "col2": [1,2,2,3]*10}
val_data = {"col1": [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] * 10, "col2": [1, 4, 5]*10}
test = Dataset(pd.DataFrame(data=test_data), label="col1")
val = Dataset(pd.DataFrame(data=val_data), label="col1")

discrepancies = new_label_train_validation(test, val)

if discrepancies:
    print("Discrepancies found:", discrepancies)
else:
    print("No discrepancies found.")
```

In this code, the function `new_label_train_validation` is called with two datasets, `test` and `val`, and the discrepancies are stored in the `discrepancies` variable. If there are any discrepancies, they are printed, otherwise, a message saying that no discrepancies were found is printed.
