    ## Regression Testing

    This notebook will demonstrate how to perform regression testing. Regression testing is a process of checking if the output of a system is the same as the expected output.

    In this notebook, we will use Python's `unittest` module to perform regression testing.

    ## Step 1: Import the necessary libraries

    ```python
    import unittest
    ```

    ## Step 2: Create a new class

    We will create a new class `RegressionTest` that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`.

    ```python
    class RegressionTest(unittest.TestCase):
    ```

    ## Step 3: Write regression tests

    In this class, we will write regression tests. For example, let's say we have a function `add(a, b)` that we want to test.

    ```python
    def test_add(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(1, 2), 3)
        self.assertEqual(add(-1, 1), 0)
        self.assertEqual(add(-1, -1), -2)
    ```

    Each test method starts with `test_` to indicate it is a test method. The `assertEqual` method is used to check if the result of the function call is equal to the expected result.

    ## Step 4: Run the regression tests

    We can run the regression tests by calling the `unittest.main()` function.

    ```python
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()
    ```

    This will run all the tests in the class. If any test fails, the test runner will output an error message.

    This is a simple example of regression testing. In real-world applications, regression testing can be more complex and may involve more than just simple equality checks.

    ## Step 5: Add more tests

    You can add more tests to the `test_add` method to check other aspects of your code.

    This is just a basic example of regression testing. Real-world regression testing can be more complex and may involve more than just simple equality checks.
