The code you provided is a set of commands for building a machine learning model using the Nannyml library in Python. The commands are for building a deep learning model for a car loan dataset. The model is a sequence of convolutional layers, batch normalization layers, and fully connected layers. The model is trained for 10 epochs. The model's performance is evaluated on the test set. The model's parameters are also printed at the end.

The code also includes a utility class `BatchNormParam` for batch normalization calculations, a method `batchNormUpdate` for updating the parameters of the batch normalization layer, and a class `BatchNormBlock` for the batch normalization layer itself.

The code also includes a section for training the model, printing the loss, accuracy, and other metrics, and printing the value of the gamma and beta parameters in the first BatchNorm layer.

The code also includes a section for printing the value of the gamma and beta parameters in the first BatchNorm layer.
