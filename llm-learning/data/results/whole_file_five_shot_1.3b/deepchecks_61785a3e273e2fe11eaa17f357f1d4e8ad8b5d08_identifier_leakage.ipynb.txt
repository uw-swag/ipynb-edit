    # Modify the check without a function
    # The check is designed to detect leakage in the identifier column.
    # The 'IdentifierLeakage' class is a custom check that calculates the PPScore, a measure of leakage in the identifier column.
    # The 'run' method of the 'IdentifierLeakage' class is used to execute the check.
    # The 'run' method takes a 'Dataset' object as an argument, which contains the data to be checked.

    # The 'ppscore_params' argument is a dictionary that specifies the parameters for the PPScore calculation.
    # In this case, the 'sample' parameter is set to 10, which means that the PPScore will be calculated using a sample of the identifier column.

    # The 'run' method returns a dictionary that contains the results of the check.
    # The dictionary includes the PPScore, which is a measure of the amount of leakage in the identifier column.

    # If the PPScore is less than 0.05, the check returns a message indicating that there is a potential for leakage in the identifier column.

    # If the PPScore is greater than or equal to 0.05, the check returns a message indicating that there is no potential for leakage in the identifier column.

    # The 'IdentifierLeakage' class is a part of the 'mlchecks.checks.leakage' module, which is a part of the 'mlchecks' package.

    # The 'run' method is a method of the 'IdentifierLeakage' class, which is a part of the 'mlchecks.base' module.

    # The 'Dataset' class is a part of the 'mlchecks.base' module, which is a part of the 'mlchecks' package.

    # The 'Dataset' class is used to represent a dataset, which is a part of the 'mlchecks.base' module, which is a part of the 'mlchecks' package.

    # The 'Dataset' class has the following attributes:
    # - 'data': a pandas DataFrame containing the data to be checked.
    # - 'label': the name of the label column.
