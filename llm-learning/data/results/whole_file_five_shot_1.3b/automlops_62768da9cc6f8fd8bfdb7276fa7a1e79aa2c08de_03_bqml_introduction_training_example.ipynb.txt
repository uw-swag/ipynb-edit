    The commit message "removed ml.googleapis.com from APIs list" is not related to the code you provided. It's a suggestion to remove the 'ml' package from the list of installed packages. This is not a direct modification of the code, but a suggestion to improve the code's readability and maintainability.

    The original code you provided is already clean and well-structured, with clear comments and proper indentation. The commit message you provided is also clear and concise, indicating that the code is well-structured and follows the conventional commit message format.

    However, if you want to remove 'ml' from the list of installed packages, you can do so by running the following command:

    ```python
    !pip3 uninstall ml -y
    ```

    Please note that this will uninstall the 'ml' package and its dependencies, which may not be desirable if you're using this code in a production environment.

    Also, remember to replace '[your-project-id]' with your actual GCP project ID.

    If you have any other questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.
