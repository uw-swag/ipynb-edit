    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses TensorFlow, Keras, and PySpark to perform image recognition on a dataset of images. The notebook includes functions for loading and preprocessing image data, creating and initializing an approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) index, loading pre-trained models, and making predictions on new images.

    The notebook also includes a function for getting the top 10 most similar images to a given query image, and a function for getting the corresponding recipes from the ANN results.

    The notebook also includes a function for displaying the top 10 most similar images to a given query image, along with their corresponding labels and probabilities.
