    ## Model Summary

    The 24f model is a deep learning model that is trained to predict the user score based on the game's features. The model is composed of several layers, each with a different number of units. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and the mean squared error loss function.

    The model architecture is as follows:

    - The input layer has 24 units, which are the features extracted from the game.
    - The first hidden layer has 128 units.
    - The second hidden layer has 64 units.
    - The third hidden layer has 32 units.
    - The output layer has 1 unit.

    The model is trained for 100 epochs.

    The model's performance is evaluated using the mean squared error loss function.
