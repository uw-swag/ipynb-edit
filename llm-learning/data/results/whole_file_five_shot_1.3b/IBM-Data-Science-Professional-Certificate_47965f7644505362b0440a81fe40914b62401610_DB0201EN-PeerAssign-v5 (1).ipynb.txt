    The code you've provided is a set of Jupyter notebook cells that use the `%sql` magic command to interact with a database. The cells are designed to perform various database operations and return the results.

    Here's a brief explanation of the cells:

    - Cell 0-3: These cells install the necessary Python packages for interacting with the database.
    - Cell 4-7: These cells connect to the database, execute SQL queries, and return the results.
    - Cell 8: This cell uses the `%%sql` magic command to run a SQL query.
    - Cell 9-12: These cells use the `%%sql` magic command to run a series of SQL queries and return the results.

    The connection string for the database is provided in the cell 2. The `%%sql` magic command is used to execute SQL commands in the notebook. The `%sql` magic command is used to connect to the database and execute SQL commands.
