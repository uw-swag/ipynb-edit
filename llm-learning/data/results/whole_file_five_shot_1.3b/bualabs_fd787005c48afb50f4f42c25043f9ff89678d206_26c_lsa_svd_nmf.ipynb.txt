    The Term-Document Matrix (TDM) is a matrix where each row represents a document and each column represents a term (word). The value at each cell of the matrix represents the frequency of the term in the document.

    In the context of machine learning, the TDM is used to represent the frequency of words in a document. It's a common method used in text mining and information retrieval.

    The TDM can be used for various tasks such as topic modeling, document clustering, and text classification.

    In the given code, we are using the TDM to perform dimensionality reduction. The SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) is a method used to decompose a matrix into its constituent parts. The SVD is used to find the principal components of a matrix.

    The SVD is a good method for dimensionality reduction because it can handle large matrices and it can also handle the non-linearity in the data.

    The code snippet `%time u, s, v = np.linalg.svd(vectors, full_matrices=False)` is used to perform the SVD on the TDM. The output of the SVD is the U, S, and Vh matrices, which are used to reconstruct the original matrix.

    The SVD is a good method for dimensionality reduction because it can handle large matrices and it can also handle the non-linearity in the data.

    The code snippet `%time u, s, v = decomposition.randomized_svd(vectors, 10)` is used to perform the Randomized SVD on the TDM. The output of the SVD is the U, S, and Vh matrices, which are used to reconstruct the original matrix.

    The SVD is a good method for dimensionality reduction because it can handle large matrices and it can also handle the non-linearity in the data.

    The code snippet `%time u, s, v = fbpca.pca(vectors, 10)` is used to perform the PCA on the TDM. The output of the PCA is the U, S, and Vh matrices, which are used to reconstruct the original matrix.
