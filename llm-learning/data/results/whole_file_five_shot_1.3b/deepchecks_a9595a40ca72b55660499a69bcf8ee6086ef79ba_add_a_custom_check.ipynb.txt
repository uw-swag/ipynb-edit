    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook and it seems to be a part of a larger project. The code is used to compare the sizes of a training dataset and a test dataset. The `DatasetSizeComparison` class is a custom check that is used to compare the sizes of a training dataset and a test dataset.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The `DatasetSizeComparison` class inherits from the `TrainTestCheck` class, which is a base class for all checks that compare the sizes of a training dataset and a test dataset.

    - The `run_logic` method is where the actual comparison logic is implemented. It takes as input a `Context` object, which contains the training and test datasets. It then calculates the sizes of the datasets and returns a `CheckResult` object with the sizes.

    - The `DatasetSizeComparison` class also has a `display` method, which is used to display the results of the check. It creates a bar graph of the sizes of the training and test datasets, and also displays the sizes in a pandas DataFrame.

    - In the last part of the code, an instance of the `DatasetSizeComparison` class is run on a training dataset and a test dataset. The result is a `CheckResult` object, which contains the sizes of the datasets and the display function.

    This code is part of a larger project and it's not clear what the purpose of the code is. It seems to be a part of a larger project, but without more context, it's hard to say what the purpose of this code is.

    Please provide more context or clarify what you're trying to achieve with this code.
