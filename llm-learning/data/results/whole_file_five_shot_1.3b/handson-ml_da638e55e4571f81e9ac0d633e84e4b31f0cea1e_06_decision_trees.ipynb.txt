    ### Cell 1: Python Basics
    # Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation.

    ### Cell 2: Python Syntax
    # Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

    ### Cell 3: Python Variables
    # In Python, you can assign a value to a variable with the assignment operator (=).

    ### Cell 4: Python Data Types
    # Python has several data types including integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

    ### Cell 5: Python Control Structures
    # Python supports various control structures like if, for, while, and try/except.

    ### Cell 6: Python Functions
    # Python functions are defined using the def keyword.

    ### Cell 7: Python Classes
    # Python classes are defined using the class keyword.

    ### Cell 8: Python Modules
    # Python modules are Python files containing a set of functions and data.

    ## Chapter 6: Introduction to Data Science
    ###

    ### Cell 1: Data Science Tools
    # Python is widely used in data science due to its simplicity and the availability of libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.

    ### Cell 2: Data Science Libraries
    # Python has several libraries for data science like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.

    ### Cell 3: Data Cleaning
    # Data cleaning is the process of removing or correcting the errors, inconsistencies, and irrelevant data points.

    ### Cell 4: Data Visualization
    # Data visualization is the process of converting data into visual form.
