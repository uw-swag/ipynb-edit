    The code you provided is a refactoring of a vision suite, which is a set of tools for data analysis and visualization in the field of computer vision. The refactoring includes:

    1. The `VisionData` class from `deepchecks.vision.base` has been moved to `deepchecks.vision.datasets.base`.
    2. The `ClassPerformance` class from `deepchecks.vision.checks.performance` has been moved to `deepchecks.vision.checks.base`.
    3. The `ClassificationPredictionFormatter` class from `deepchecks.vision.utils.classification_formatters` has been moved to `deepchecks.vision.utils.prediction_formatters`.
    4. The `ClassPerformance` class has been updated to use the new `VisionData` and `PredictionFormatter` classes.
    5. The `VisionData` class has been updated to use the new `PredictionFormatter` class.
    6. The `coco` module from `deepchecks.vision.datasets.detection` has been moved to `deepchecks.vision.datasets`.
    7. The `DetectionPredictionFormatter` class from `deepchecks.vision.utils.detection_formatters` has been moved to `deepchecks.vision.utils.prediction_formatters`.
    8. The `ClassPerformance` class has been updated to use the new `DetectionData` and `PredictionFormatter` classes.
    9. The `DetectionData` class has been updated to use the new `PredictionFormatter` class.
    10. The `yolo` model from `deepchecks.vision.datasets.detection` has been moved to `deepchecks.vision.datasets`.

    The refactoring is done to improve the code structure and make it more modular and maintainable.
