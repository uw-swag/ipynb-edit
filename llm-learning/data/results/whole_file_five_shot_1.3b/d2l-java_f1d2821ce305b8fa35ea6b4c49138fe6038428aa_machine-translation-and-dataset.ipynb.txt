    ### Section 9.5: Machine Translation and the Dataset

    ### Exercise:
    ### Implement a simple machine translation model using the Keras API.
    ### You can use the Keras API to build a sequence-to-sequence model for machine translation.
    ### The dataset you can use is the "WMT'14 English-German" machine translation task.
    ### You can find the dataset in the "data/wmt14.en-de" directory.
    ### The model should be trained for 10 epochs.
    ### The model should be saved as a Keras HDF5 file.

    ### Solution:
    ### Please provide the solution for the exercise.
