The ADALINE (Adaptive Linear Neuron) algorithm is a type of perceptron that is adaptive to the data. It is a simple yet effective method for binary classification tasks. The algorithm is based on the idea that the weights of the neuron can be adjusted based on the error of the prediction.

The ADALINE algorithm is a simple yet effective method for binary classification tasks. It is based on the idea that the weights of the neuron can be adjusted based on the error of the prediction. The error of the prediction is calculated as the difference between the actual and predicted values. The weights are then adjusted based on this error. This process is repeated for a fixed number of iterations, or until the weights converge.

The limitations of the ADALINE algorithm are:

1. It is a simple yet effective method for binary classification tasks.
2. It is not suitable for multi-class classification tasks.
3. It does not handle the case of overfitting.
4. It does not handle the case of underfitting.
5. It does not handle the case of noisy data.
