    ## 1. Introduction to Data Structures

    ### 1.1 Definition of Data Structures

    # Data structures are a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.

    ### 1.2 Types of Data Structures

    # 1.2.1 Array
    # An array is a data structure that stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type.

    # 1.2.2 Linked List
    # A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Each element (node) of a linked list contains a connection to another node in the list.

    # 1.2.3 Stack
    # A stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).

    # 1.2.4 Queue
    # A queue is a linear structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).

    # 1.2.5 Tree
    # A tree is a widely used abstract data type (ADT) that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node.

    # 1.2.6 Graph
    # A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.

    # 1.2.7 Hash Table
    # A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

    # 1.2.8 Heap
    # A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. It is mainly used to implement priority queues.

    # 1.2.9 Matrix
