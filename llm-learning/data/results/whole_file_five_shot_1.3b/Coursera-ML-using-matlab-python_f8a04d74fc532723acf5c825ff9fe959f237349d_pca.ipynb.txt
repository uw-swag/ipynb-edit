```python
    from azureml.core import Workspace, Dataset

    # Load the workspace from the saved config file
    ws = Workspace.from_config()

    # Create a new Python script and upload it to the current project
    with open("upload.py", "w") as f:
        f.write("""
        # This is a sample Python script
        print("Hello, world!")
        """)

    # Upload the script to the current project
    ws.upload_file(name="upload.py", path_on_compute="upload.py")

    # Create a new Python script and upload it to the current project
    with open("main.py", "w") as f:
        f.write("""
        # This is a sample Python script
        from azureml.core import Workspace, Dataset

        # Load the workspace from the saved config file
        ws = Workspace.from_config()

        # Load the dataset
        dataset = Dataset.get_by_name(ws, 'my_dataset')

        # Print the first five rows of the dataset
        dataset.take(5).to_pandas_dataframe().head()
        """)

    # Upload the script to the current project
    ws.upload_file(name="main.py", path_on_compute="main.py")
    ```

    Please replace 'my_dataset' with your actual dataset name.

    Note: The script above will only work if you have the necessary permissions to upload files to the workspace.
