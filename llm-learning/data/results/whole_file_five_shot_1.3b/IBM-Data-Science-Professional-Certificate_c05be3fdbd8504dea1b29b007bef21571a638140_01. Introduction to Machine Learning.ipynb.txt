    ## 01. Introduction to Machine Learning

    Machine learning is a key component of data science. It involves the use of algorithms and statistical methods to analyze and make predictions or decisions based on data.

    This notebook will introduce the basics of machine learning, including the types of machine learning, the steps involved in machine learning, and the importance of machine learning in today's data-driven world.

    ## 02. Importing Libraries

    We will start by importing the necessary libraries for machine learning.

    ```python
    # Regular python libraries
    import os
    import requests
    import sys

    # fast.ai
    from fastai.vision import *
    import torchvision.models as models

    # Azure
    import azureml.core
    from azureml.core import Experiment, Workspace
    from azureml.core.image import ContainerImage
    from azureml.core.model import Model
    from azureml.core.webservice import AciWebservice, Webservice
    from azureml.exceptions import ProjectSystemException, UserErrorException

    # Computer Vision repository
    sys.path.extend([".", "..", "../.."])
    ```

    ## 03. Checking Core SDK Version

    We will then check the version of the Azure Machine Learning SDK.

    ```python
    print(f"Azure ML SDK Version: {azureml.core.VERSION}")
    ```

    ## 04. Workspace Creation

    We will create a workspace and define the variables needed for the workspace.

    ```python
    # Let's define these variables here - These pieces of information can be found on the portal
    ```

    ## 05. End of Notebook

    This concludes the introduction to machine learning.

    ```
    ```
    ## 06. Exporting Notebook

    We will export the notebook for future use.

    ```python
    !jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --no-prompt
    ```

    ## 07. Deleting Workspace
