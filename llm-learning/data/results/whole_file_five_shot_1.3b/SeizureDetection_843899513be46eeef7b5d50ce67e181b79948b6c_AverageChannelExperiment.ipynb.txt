    The code you've provided seems to be a set of functions and methods for processing and analyzing medical data. Here's a brief explanation of what each function does:

1. `removeNonNumericValues(df)`: This function removes rows from a DataFrame that contain any non-numeric values.

2. `AverageChannelFeatures(df, readEdf, sample_rate, step, pca_tolerance, smote_neighbors, csvExportFile)`: This function preprocesses the data by applying various feature extraction and normalization techniques. It also uses SMOTE to balance the dataset.

3. `AverageChannelTrainTestData(smote_features, test_ratio, k_fold, perfInd)`: This function splits the preprocessed data into a training set and a test set.

4. `AverageChannelExperiment(df, channels, readEdf, csvImportFile, csvExportFile, dataset, sample_rate, time_window, test_ratio, pca_tolerance, smote_neighbors, k_fold, knn_neighbors, rf_estimators, max_iter, dropout, loss_function, epochs, lstm_units, dense1_units, dense2_units, batch, step)`: This function runs a series of machine learning algorithms on the preprocessed data.

Please note that the `AverageChannelExperiment` function is a wrapper around several other functions, which may not be the best practice. It's recommended to refactor this function to make it more modular and reusable.
