```python
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml

    # Load the data, this will return a dict-like object.
    data, target, attribute = fetch_openml('mnist_784', version=1, return_X_y=True)

    # Split the data into training and test sets.
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Now, we can use the training data to train our model.
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Now, we can use the test data to evaluate the model.
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
    y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
    print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))

    # Now, we can use the test data to evaluate the model.
    y_pred_sample = clf.predict(X_test[:5])
    print("Predictions:", y_pred_sample)
    print("True values:", y_test[:5])

    # This will print the actual values of the first 5 samples.
    # The model might have learned to predict the first 5 samples correctly,
    # but it's not guaranteed.
    ```

    The code above demonstrates how to use the MNIST dataset from sklearn, which is a set of 70,000 small images of digits handwritten by high school students and employees of the US Census Bureau. The images are labeled originally. We then use a RandomForestClassifier to train a model on the training data and evaluate its performance on the test data.

    The code also demonstrates how to use the test data to make predictions on the test data, but it's important to note that this is not a foolproof
