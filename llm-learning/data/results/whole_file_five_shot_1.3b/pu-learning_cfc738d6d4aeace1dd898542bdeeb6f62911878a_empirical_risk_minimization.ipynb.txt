The code you provided seems to be correct. The bug in the dataset creation and rerunning the notebooks are not present. The code is creating a dataset for a binary classification problem, and then using a logistic regression model to classify the data. The f1_score is calculated to evaluate the performance of the model. The plots are also created to visualize the data.

If you have any specific issues with the code, please provide more details so I can help you better.
