    The code provided is a collaborative filtering recommendation system using Python and the libraries pandas and numpy. The system first reads in movie and user data from two CSV files, processes the data, and then recommends movies to users based on their past ratings. The Pearson correlation coefficient is used to measure the similarity between users and movies. The top 10 recommended movies for each user are then displayed.

    The code is divided into several steps:

    1. Reading in the movie and user data from CSV files.
    2. Processing the data to extract the year, title, and genres.
    3. Filtering out the movies by title.
    4. Filtering out users that have watched movies that the input has watched.
    5. Calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient for each user.
    6. Sorting the users based on the Pearson correlation coefficient.
    7. Displaying the top 10 recommended movies for each user.

    The final step displays the top 10 recommended movies for each user.

    Please note that the code provided is a basic example and may not work as expected in all scenarios. It is recommended to use a more sophisticated approach to collaborative filtering, such as matrix factorization or deep learning, to improve the accuracy of the recommendation system.
