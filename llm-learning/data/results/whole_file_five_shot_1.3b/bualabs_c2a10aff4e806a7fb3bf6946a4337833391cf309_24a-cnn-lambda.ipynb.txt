The code you provided is a complete Jupyter notebook that uses PyTorch, a popular machine learning library, to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset. The notebook includes a number of cells that cover different aspects of the process, including data loading, model definition, training, and evaluation.

The code is divided into several sections:

1. **Importing necessary libraries and defining the dataset**: This section imports the necessary libraries and defines the MNIST dataset.

2. **Defining the CNN model**: This section defines the CNN model using PyTorch's nn.Sequential and nn.Conv2d classes.

3. **Normalizing the data**: This section normalizes the data to have zero mean and unit variance.

4. **Defining the training and validation datasets**: This section creates a custom Dataset class that can be used with PyTorch's DataLoader.

5. **Defining the optimizer and loss function**: This section defines the optimizer and loss function for the model.

6. **Defining the callbacks**: This section defines callbacks for model training, including recorder for plotting learning curves, and param scheduler for adjusting the learning rate.

7. **Defining the runner**: This section defines the runner class that handles the training process.

8. **Defining the average statistics callback**: This section defines a callback that calculates and prints the average statistics of the model during training.

9. **Defining the learning rate scheduler**: This section defines the learning rate scheduler.

10. **Defining the model and training**: This section defines the model, optimizer, and learner, and then trains the model using the runner.

11. **Evaluating the model**: This section evaluates the model on the test set.

12. **Plotting the learning curves**: This section plots the learning curves of the model.

13. **Plotting the loss curve**: This section plots the loss curve of the model.

14. **Plotting the confusion matrix**: This section plots the confusion matrix of the model.

15. **Plotting the ROC curve**: This section plots the
