```python
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    from deepchecks.checks.methodology import *
    from deepchecks.base import Dataset

    # Example 1: DataFrame
    df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(100, 3), columns=['x1', 'x2', 'x3'])
    df['x4'] = df['x1'] * 0.5 + df['x2']
    df['label'] = df['x2'] + 0.1 * df['x1']
    df['x5'] = df['label'].apply(lambda x: 'v1' if x < 0 else 'v2')

    # Example 2: Dataset
    ds = Dataset(df, label='label')

    # Example 3: SingleFeatureContribution
    my_check = SingleFeatureContribution(ppscore_params={'sample': 10})
    my_check.run(dataset=ds)
    ```

    ### Explanation:
    - In the first example, we create a DataFrame with random data.
    - In the second example, we create a Dataset from the DataFrame.
    - In the third example, we run the SingleFeatureContribution check on the Dataset.
    - In the fourth example, we create a SingleFeatureContribution check with some parameters.
    - Finally, we run the check on the Dataset.

    The `SingleFeatureContribution` check computes the contribution of each feature to the prediction of the model. It provides a visualization of the contribution of each feature to the prediction.

    The `ppscore_params` parameter is a dictionary that contains the parameters for the PPScore check. The PPScore check is a method used to evaluate the performance of a model.

    The `run` method of the `SingleFeatureContribution` check is used to run the check on a Dataset.

    The `run` method returns a DataFrame that contains the results of the check.

    The `Dataset` class is a high-level interface for working with datasets. It provides a way to load data, perform transformations
