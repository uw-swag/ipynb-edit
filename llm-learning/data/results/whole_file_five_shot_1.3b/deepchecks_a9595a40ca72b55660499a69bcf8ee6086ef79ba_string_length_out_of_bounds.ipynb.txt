    The commit message "fixing docs (#898)" is a fix for a documentation issue. The issue is with the StringLengthOutOfBounds check in DeepChecks, which is used to check the length of strings in a DataFrame. The check is designed to find outliers in the string length, but it seems to be failing to find any outliers in the data. This could be due to the data not having any outliers, or the data being too long.

    The fix is to adjust the parameters of the StringLengthOutOfBounds check. The current parameters (min_unique_value_ratio=0.01) are set to find outliers in the string length, but it might be better to set these parameters to find outliers in the number of unique values.
