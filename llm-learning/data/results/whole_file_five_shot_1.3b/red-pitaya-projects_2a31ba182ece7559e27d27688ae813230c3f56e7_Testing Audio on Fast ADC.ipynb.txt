    ## Updated Audio Test Markdown

    This markdown file is used to test the audio functionality of the Red Pitaya FPGA. The audio is generated using the Red Pitaya's Mercury overlay module, which is a part of the Red Pitaya's FPGA. The audio is then played using the Matplotlib library, and the audio data is displayed using the IPython.display library.

    ### Code Explanation

    - The first cell imports the necessary libraries and initializes the Red Pitaya FPGA.
    - The second cell generates an audio signal using the Red Pitaya's Mercury overlay module. The audio signal is generated at a rate of 45000 Hz. The trigger timing is set to 0 sample periods before and after the audio signal. The hardware trigger sources are disabled.
    - The third cell starts the audio signal and waits for it to be triggered. It then plots the audio data and displays it using the Matplotlib library.
    - The fourth cell loads the audio data into the IPython.display library and displays it using the IPython.display.Audio function. The sample rate is set to 3000 Hz.

    ### Note

    This is a basic test markdown file. It may need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of your project.
