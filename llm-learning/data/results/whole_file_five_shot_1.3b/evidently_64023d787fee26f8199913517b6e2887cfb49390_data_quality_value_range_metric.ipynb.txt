    ### Response:
    # You can add data quality metrics to your project by following these steps:

    # 1. Identify the data quality issues.
    # 2. Define the metrics you want to track.
    # 3. Implement the metrics in your code.
    # 4. Track the metrics over time.

    # For example, you might add metrics to track the number of missing values in a column, the number of duplicate values, the distribution of values, etc.

    # Here's a simple example of how you might implement these metrics in Python:

    ```python
    # Assuming df is your DataFrame and 'column_name' is the column you're interested in
    missing_values = df['column_name'].isnull().sum()
    duplicate_values = df['column_name'].duplicated().sum()
    # Add more metrics as needed
    ```

    # Then, you can track these metrics over time, and compare them to your goals.

    # Please note that the actual implementation will depend on the specifics of your project and data.
