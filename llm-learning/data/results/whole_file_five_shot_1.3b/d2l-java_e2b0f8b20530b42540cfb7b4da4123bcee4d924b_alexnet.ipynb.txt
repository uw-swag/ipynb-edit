    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses PySpark to implement the AlexNet and VGG networks. 

    The notebook starts by importing necessary libraries and setting up the Spark environment. It then loads the necessary Maven dependencies for the AI/ML libraries used in the notebook.

    The notebook then loads the utilities for plotting and other utilities.

    The notebook then imports the necessary AI/ML libraries and sets up the model for the AlexNet and VGG networks.

    The notebook then trains the model using the training data and evaluates it on the test data.

    The notebook then calculates the average training time per epoch and the training and test accuracy for each epoch.

    The notebook then creates a table with the training and test loss, training accuracy, and test accuracy for each epoch.

    Finally, the notebook renders a line plot of the training and test loss and accuracy for each epoch.

    Please note that the code provided is a simplified version of the actual implementation. The actual implementation may require additional steps or configurations based on the specific requirements of the project.
