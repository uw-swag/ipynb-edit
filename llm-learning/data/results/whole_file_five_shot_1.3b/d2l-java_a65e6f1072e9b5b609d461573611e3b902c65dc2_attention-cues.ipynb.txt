    ## 106. Attention Cues

    ## 106.1. Introduction

    Attention cues are a crucial part of human-computer interaction (HCI) and are used to guide the user's attention to the most important information. They are typically implemented using visual cues such as color, size, or positioning.

    ## 106.2. Types of Attention Cues

    There are several types of attention cues, including:

    - **Focus Cues**: These are used to guide the user's attention to the current task or action. For example, a button in a form or a checkbox in a dialog box.

    - **Prompt Cues**: These are used to guide the user's attention to the information they need. For example, a label in a form or a tooltip in a dialog box.

    - **Confirmation Cues**: These are used to guide the user's attention to the result of their action. For example, a confirmation message in a dialog box.

    - **Feedback Cues**: These are used to provide immediate feedback to the user. For example, a progress bar or a notification message.

    ## 106.3. Implementation

    Attention cues can be implemented in various ways, including:

    - **Using Visual Cues**: These are the most common method. The user is shown a visual cue (like a color, size, or positioning) to guide their attention.

    - **Using Audio Cues**: Audio cues can be used to guide the user's attention. For example, a sound effect or a visual cue can be used to guide the user's attention.

    - **Using Haptic Feedback**: Haptic feedback is another method that can be used to guide the user's attention. For example, a haptic feedback device can be used to guide the user's attention.

    ## 106.4. Evaluation

    The effectiveness of attention cues can be evaluated using various methods, including:

    - **Observational Evaluation**: This involves observing the user in
