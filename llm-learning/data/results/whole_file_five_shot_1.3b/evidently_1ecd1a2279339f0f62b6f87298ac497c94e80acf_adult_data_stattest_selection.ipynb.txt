```python
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

    # Assuming you have two groups of data
    group1 = np.random.normal(loc=10, scale=1, size=100)
    group2 = np.random.normal(loc=12, scale=1, size=100)

    # Perform the t-test
    t_statistic, p_value = ttest_ind(group1, group2)

    print(f"T-statistic: {t_statistic}")
    print(f"P-value: {p_value}")

    # If the p-value is less than the chosen significance level (usually 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the groups are significantly different.
    if p_value < 0.05:
        print("The groups are significantly different.")
    else:
        print("The groups are not significantly different.")
    ```
    This example uses the scipy.stats.ttest_ind function to perform a t-test on two groups of data. The t-test is used to compare the means of two groups. If the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the groups are significantly different.
