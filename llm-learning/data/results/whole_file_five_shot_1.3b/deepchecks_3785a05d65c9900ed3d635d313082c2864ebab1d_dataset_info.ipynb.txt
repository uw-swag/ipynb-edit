```python
    # This is a placeholder for the actual code.
    # The function `dataset_info` is supposed to return some information about the dataset.
    # For now, it just returns a string.

    def dataset_info():
        return "This is a placeholder for the actual dataset information."

    # Now, we can test the function with some example data.
    print(dataset_info())
    ```
