    The code you provided is a series of steps to prepare for a connection to an Amazon RDS instance, which is used to store and retrieve data. Here are the steps:

    1. Install the necessary Python packages for MySQL connection.
    2. Establish a connection to the RDS instance.
    3. Read in a CSV file.
    4. Check for missing values and data types for columns.
    5. Drop columns that are not necessary for the model.
    6. Encode categorical variables with a ranking system.
    7. Encode the remaining categorical variables.
    8. Merge the encoded dataframes.
    9. Count the number of unique items in each column.
    10. Remove the Attrition column from the list of columns to be encoded.
    11. Check the target variable "Attrition" for any missing or inconsistent values.
    12. Encode the target variable "Attrition" using a label encoder.
    13. Check the dataframe to confirm the encoding was successful.
    14. Save the cleaned dataframe to a CSV file for use in both Machine Learning Models.

    Please note that the code provided is a general guide and may need to be adjusted based on the specific dataset and the machine learning models you are using.
    Also, the secret value for the RDS connection is not shown in the code, so it should be obtained from the AWS RDS instance.
