    ### Git Checking
    ###

    #### Git Branching
    # Git allows you to work on different features or versions of a project at the same time. You can create a new branch to work on a new feature, make changes, and then merge them back into the main branch when you're ready.

    #### Git Pull Request
    # A pull request is a way to request that someone else review your changes to your code before it is merged into the main branch.

    #### Git Merge Conflict
    # A merge conflict is a situation where Git can't automatically merge your changes into the main branch because you've made changes in two different areas of the same part of the code.

    #### Git Rebase
    # Rebasing is a way to integrate changes from one branch into another. It's a way to keep a linear history of your project.

    #### Git Stash
    # Stashing is a way to save your changes temporarily, and then you can apply them later. It's a way to keep your changes separate from the changes you make in the main branch.

    #### Git Ignore
    # Git ignore is a file that tells Git which files or directories to ignore. This is useful for projects that have files or directories that you don't want to track or commit.

    #### Git Submodules
    # Submodules are a way to include another Git repository as a submodule in your project. This allows you to keep a copy of the other repository's files in your project's repository.

    #### Git Workflows
    # Git workflows are a way to manage and coordinate the use of Git. They can be used to automate the process of creating and managing branches, merging, and releasing software.

    #### Git Large File Storage (LFS)
    #
