    The code you provided is a Python script for a simple linear regression model using gradient descent. The script includes functions for computing the cost and gradient of the cost function, a function for performing gradient descent, and a function for plotting the cost and gradient as a function of iteration.

    The script also includes a prediction of house prices for different sizes (1000, 1400, and 1800 square feet) and a function to plot a contour plot of the cost and gradient as a function of the weight and bias.

    The script also includes a function to plot the divergence of the cost and gradient as a function of the weight and bias.
