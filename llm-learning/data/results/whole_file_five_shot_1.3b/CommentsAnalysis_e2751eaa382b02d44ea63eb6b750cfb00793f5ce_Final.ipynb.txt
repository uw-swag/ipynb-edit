    This notebook contains a series of code cells that perform various operations on a dataset of comments. The dataset includes information about the comments, such as the length of the comment, the number of links in the comment, the number of emojis in the comment, the proportion of comments with emojis, the proportion of comments without emojis, the proportion of comments with a big letter, the proportion of comments with a sentence count, the proportion of comments with punctuation, the proportion of comments with English words, the mean word length of the comments, the proportion of comments with capital letters, the proportion of comments with emojis, the proportion of comments with a big letter, the proportion of comments with a sentence count, the proportion of comments with punctuation, the proportion of comments with English words, the proportion of comments with a big letter, the proportion of comments with a sentence count, and the proportion of comments with a total word count.

    The notebook also includes code cells that perform various feature engineering operations on the comments, such as splitting the comments into sentences, counting the number of words, counting the number of characters, and counting the number of emojis in the comments.

    The notebook also includes code cells that perform various machine learning operations on the comments, such as training a logistic regression model, training a gradient boosting classifier, and evaluating the performance of the models.

    The notebook also includes code cells that perform various data cleaning operations on the comments, such as removing links, removing emojis, and removing comments with a total word count less than 25.

    The notebook also includes code cells that perform various statistical analysis operations on the comments, such as calculating the mean, standard deviation, and variance of the comment lengths, the mean, standard deviation, and variance of the word lengths, and the mean, standard deviation, and variance of the character counts.

    The notebook also includes code cells that perform various visualization operations on the comments, such as creating histograms, bar graphs, and scatter plots to visualize the results of the statistical analysis.

    The notebook also includes code cells that perform various preprocessing operations on the comments, such as converting the comments to lower case, removing stop words, stemming, lemmatization, and converting the comments to a bag-of-words representation.

    The notebook also includes code cells that perform various post
