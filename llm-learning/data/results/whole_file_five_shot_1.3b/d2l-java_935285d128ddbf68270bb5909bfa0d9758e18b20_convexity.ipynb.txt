    It seems like you're trying to update the mxnet-native version in your Maven settings. However, your request is a bit unclear. 

    If you're looking to update the mxnet-native version, you can do so by changing the version number in the Maven command. For example, if you want to update to version 1.7.0-a, you would use the following command:

    ```
    %maven ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-native-auto:1.7.0-a
    ```

    If you're looking to update the mxnet-native version in your Maven settings, you would need to manually edit the `pom.xml` file in the `ai.djl.mxnet` module. You would need to find the `<version>` element and change the value to the new version number.

    Please provide more context or clarify your request if you need further assistance.
