The code you provided is a demonstration of how to use the Deepchecks library to perform label drift checks. The library is used to detect if the labels in the training and test datasets are drifting.

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. The code first imports the necessary libraries and modules.
2. It then generates random data for the training and test datasets.
3. The training dataset is then converted into a Deepchecks Dataset object.
4. The test dataset is also converted into a Dataset object.
5. The Deepchecks library's TrainTestLabelDrift class is used to perform a label drift check.
6. The check is run on the training and test datasets.
7. The code then demonstrates how to add a condition to the check to only include results where the drift score is not greater than a certain value.

Please note that the code provided is a simple demonstration and may not cover all edge cases or potential issues. Always ensure to thoroughly test your code to ensure it works as expected.
