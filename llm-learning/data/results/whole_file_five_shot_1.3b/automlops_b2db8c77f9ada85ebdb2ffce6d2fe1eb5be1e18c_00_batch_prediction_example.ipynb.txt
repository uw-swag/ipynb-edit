    The caching strategy in the code you provided is not explicitly mentioned. However, the caching strategy used in the code is the 'lru_cache' decorator, which is commonly used in Python to cache the results of function calls. This decorator provides a way to cache the results of a function, so that the results can be reused when the function is called again.

    Here's an example of how to use the 'lru_cache' decorator:

    ```python
    from functools import lru_cache

    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def expensive_function(arg1, arg2):
        # Some expensive operation here
        return result
    ```

    In this example, the 'lru_cache' decorator is used to cache the results of the 'expensive_function' call. The 'maxsize' parameter is optional and defaults to None, which means the cache can grow without bound.

    If you want to change the caching strategy, you can do so by modifying the 'maxsize' parameter of the 'lru_cache' decorator. For example, if you want to cache the results of the 'expensive_function' call for 1000 calls, you can do so as follows:

    ```python
    @lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
    def expensive_function(arg1, arg2):
        # Some expensive operation here
        return result
    ```

    This will cache the results of the 'expensive_function' call for the first 1000 calls. After that, the results will not be cached, and the 'expensive_function' call will be executed each time it is called.

    Please note that the 'lru_cache' decorator is a part of the 'functools' module in Python, and it is not available in all Python environments.
