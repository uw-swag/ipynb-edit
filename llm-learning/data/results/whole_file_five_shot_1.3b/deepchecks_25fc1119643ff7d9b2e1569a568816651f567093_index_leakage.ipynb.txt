The code you've provided is adding a new cell to the notebook. However, it seems like you're trying to add a new feature to the notebook, which is not possible. The code you've provided is a part of a DeepChecks check, which is a library for validating the quality of datasets. DeepChecks is a tool for validating the quality of datasets, and it's not possible to add new features to a notebook.

If you want to add a new feature to the notebook, you should create a new Python file and import it. For example, you could create a new Python file named `my_feature.py` and add your new feature there. Then, you can import this file in your notebook by using the following code:

```python
%run my_feature.py
```

Please note that this will only work if `my_feature.py` is a valid Python file and it's in the same directory as your notebook.
