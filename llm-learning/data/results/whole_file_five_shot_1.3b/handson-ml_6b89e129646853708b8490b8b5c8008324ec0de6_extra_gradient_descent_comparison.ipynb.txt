    This notebook introduces the concept of linear regression, its implementation in Python, and its application to predicting house prices. The notebook also covers the use of stochastic gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent, and batch gradient descent, and the comparison of their performance. The notebook also demonstrates how to visualize the cost function and the solution to the normal equation. The final part of the notebook animates the learning process of the different methods, showing how they converge to the optimal solution.
