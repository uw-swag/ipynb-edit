    The commit message "MLC 92 testing nb (#78)" is a reference to a merge request in the MLChecks repository. The code cells are related to testing a new label in a machine learning model. The new label is "col2" and the model is a simple linear regression model. The test data consists of two columns: "col1" and "col2". The validation data also consists of two columns: "col1" and "col2". The new_label_train_validation function is used to train and validate the model.

    However, the code is not complete and there are some missing cells. The missing cells are:

    1. The code to load the data and preprocess it for the model.
    2. The code to define the model and the training process.
    3. The code to evaluate the model and the performance of the model.
    4. The code to save and load the model.
    5. The code to evaluate the model on the validation data.
    6. The code to evaluate the model on the test data.

    The code should be completed to ensure the model is working as expected.
