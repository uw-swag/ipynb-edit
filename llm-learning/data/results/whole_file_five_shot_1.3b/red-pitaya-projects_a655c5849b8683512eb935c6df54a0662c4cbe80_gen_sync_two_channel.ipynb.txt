    The code you provided is a simple example of using the Red Pitaya FPGA overlay library in Python. It demonstrates the use of the library to control a pair of waveforms on a Red Pitaya FPGA.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The `redpitaya.overlay.mercury` module is imported, which provides a high-level interface to the Red Pitaya FPGA.
    - An instance of the FPGA overlay is created.
    - Two generators are created on the FPGA, gen0 and gen1.
    - The amplitude, offset, and waveform of the generators are set.
    - The waveform of the generators is printed.
    - The frequency of the generators is set.
    - The generators are started and enabled. A trigger is set on the first generator.
    - The generators are disabled.
