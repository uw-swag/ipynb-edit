    ## Deep Recurrent Neural Networks are a class of neural networks that consist of a sequence of interconnected layers.
    ## The most common type of RNN is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which is capable of learning from long-term dependencies.
    ## LSTMs are particularly good at learning from sequences of data that has a temporal pattern, such as speech or text.
    ## GRUs are a variant of LSTMs, which are simpler to implement and have similar performance.
    ## Bidirectional LSTMs are a special type of LSTM that can process sequences from both the left and right directions.
    ## Bert model is a transformer-based model that has been trained on a large corpus of text data.
    ## The Bert model is designed to perform tasks such as masked language modeling, next sentence prediction, and more.

    ## Deep Recurrent Neural Networks are a powerful tool for natural language processing tasks, such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and more.
    ## They are also useful for tasks like speech recognition, image captioning, and more, where the sequence of data is crucial.
    ## The deep learning community is working on more advanced versions of RNNs, such as Transformer models, which are designed to perform tasks like machine translation and text generation.
    ## The Bert model is a great example of a transformer-based model, which has the potential to revolutionize many NLP tasks.
    ## The deep learning community is also working on more advanced versions of RNNs, such as
