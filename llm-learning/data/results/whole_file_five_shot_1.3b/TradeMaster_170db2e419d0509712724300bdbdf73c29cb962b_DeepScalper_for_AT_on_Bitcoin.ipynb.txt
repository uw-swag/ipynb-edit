    The code you provided is for a trading environment, specifically for a trading agent called DeepScalper. The DeepScalper agent is a type of deep learning agent that uses reinforcement learning to trade cryptocurrencies. The code is written in Python and uses the PyTorch library for deep learning.

    The code is divided into several sections:

    1. The first section imports necessary libraries and modules.

    2. The second section defines a function `plotData` that plots the data.

    3. The third section defines the arguments for the trading environment and the agent.

    4. The fourth section defines a function `build_agent` that builds the agent.

    5. The fifth section defines a function `experiment` that trains the agent and tests it.

    6. The sixth section defines a main function that runs the entire process.

    7. The seventh section reads the test result and plots the total assets.

    Please note that the code is incomplete and may not work as expected. It is recommended to run the code in a proper environment to see the results.
