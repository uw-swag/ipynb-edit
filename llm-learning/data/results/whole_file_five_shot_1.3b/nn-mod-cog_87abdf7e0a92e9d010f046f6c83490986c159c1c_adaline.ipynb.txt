    The gradient descent algorithm is a method used to minimize a function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient.

    The process of gradient descent involves the following steps:

    1. Initialize the weights randomly.
    2. Compute the net input for each sample.
    3. Compute the activation function for each sample.
    4. Compute the error for each sample.
    5. Update the weights for each sample.
    6. Repeat steps 2-5 for a certain number of iterations.

    The weights are updated in the direction of steepest descent, which is determined by the negative of the gradient of the error function.

    The gradient descent algorithm is used in various machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks.
