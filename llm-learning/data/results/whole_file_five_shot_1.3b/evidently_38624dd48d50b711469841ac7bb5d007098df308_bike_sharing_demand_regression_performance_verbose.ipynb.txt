```
    The `verbose_level`, `include_widgets` and `list_widgets` functions are used to control the level of verbosity, to include or exclude specific widgets, and to list available widgets respectively.

    Here is an example of how to use these functions:

    ```python
    dashboard = Dashboard(tabs=[RegressionPerformanceTab(verbose_level=1, include_widgets=['Regression Model Performance Report.', 'Reference: Predicted vs Actual', 'Current: Predicted vs Actual'])])
    dashboard.calculate(ref_data, prod_data, column_mapping=column_mapping)
    dashboard.show()
    ```

    This will include the 'Regression Model Performance Report.', 'Reference: Predicted vs Actual', and 'Current: Predicted vs Actual' widgets in the dashboard.

    The `verbose_level` parameter controls the level of verbosity in the dashboard. The higher the number, the more detailed the output.

    The `include_widgets` and `list_widgets` parameters allow you to include or list specific widgets.

    The `list_widgets` function returns a list of all available widgets.

    Please note that the `verbose_level`, `include_widgets`, and `list_widgets` functions are not available in the current version of the evidently library.
    ```
    }
