    The code above is a Jupyter notebook that uses the Kaggle Digits dataset for machine learning tasks. The notebook includes a number of exercises, each of which involves a different machine learning model, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and more. The exercises also include model evaluation, visualization, and saving the trained models.
