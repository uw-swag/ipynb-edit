    The code you provided seems to be a part of a machine learning project, and it seems to be missing some imports or missing some parts. 

    Here's a general overview of what the code does:

    1. It defines a class `DataPoints` to hold two NDArrays: `X` and `y`.
    2. It defines a method `syntheticData` to generate synthetic data.
    3. It uses a `NDManager` to create random data.
    4. It uses a `Table` to display the data.
    5. It uses a `ScatterPlot` to visualize the data.
    6. It uses a `Batch` to handle the data.
    7. It uses a `GradientCollector` to compute the gradients.
    8. It uses a `Engine` to update the parameters.

    Please provide more details or context if you need a more specific explanation.
