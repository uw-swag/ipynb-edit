    The commit message "links-checks github action fix (#775)" is a fix for a GitHub action that was previously failing. The action is used to run the DeepChecks suite on a set of data, and the fix is to ensure that the action is set up correctly to run the suite.

    The action is currently set up to run the suite on every push to the repository, which is not ideal. The fix is to ensure that the action is only run when changes are made to the data, and not on every push.

    The fix involves modifying the GitHub action to only run the suite when changes are made to the data, and not on every push.

    The fix involves creating a new GitHub action that only runs the suite when changes are made to the data, and not on every push.

    The new GitHub action is set up to run the suite on every push to the repository, and it will only run the suite if changes are made to the data.
