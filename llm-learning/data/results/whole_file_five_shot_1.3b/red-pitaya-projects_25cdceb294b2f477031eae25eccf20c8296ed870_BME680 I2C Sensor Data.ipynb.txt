```
    The code is divided into several cells to make it easier to read and understand. 

    Cell 0 imports the necessary libraries.
    Cell 1 initializes the I2C bus.
    Cell 2 prints the initial temperature, pressure, humidity, and gas readings.
    Cell 3 sets up the sensor and prints the initial data.
    Cell 4 starts a new thread to continuously poll for sensor data.
    Cell 5 stops the worker thread and exits the program.
    Cell 6-10 are the main body of the program. They set up the sensor, start the worker thread, and continuously poll for sensor data.
    Cell 11-13 are used to set up the gas heater profile and select it.
    Cell 14-15 are used to set up the gas heater and start it.
    Cell 16-17 are used to set up the burn-in data and calculate the gas and humidity baselines.
    Cell 18-20 are used to calculate the air quality score and print it.
    Cell 21-22 are used to stop the program when the user presses Ctrl+C.
