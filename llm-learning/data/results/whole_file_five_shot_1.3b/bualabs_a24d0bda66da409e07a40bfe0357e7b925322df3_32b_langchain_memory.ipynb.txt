    The `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` class in Langchain is used to store and access the context of a conversation. It is particularly useful when you want to store the context of a conversation and then recall it later.

    The `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` class is a subclass of `ConversationBufferMemory` that stores the context of a conversation in a summary rather than in a buffer. The summary is a string that is created by concatenating the input and output of each context.

    The `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` class has the following methods:

    - `save_context(input, output)`: This method saves a context in the memory. The context is a dictionary that contains the input and output of the context.

    - `load_memory_variables(kwargs)`: This method loads the memory variables. The method takes keyword arguments that are used to load the memory variables.

    - `get_contexts()`: This method returns a list of the contexts in the memory.

    - `clear()`: This method clears the memory.

    The `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` class is useful when you want to store the context of a conversation and then recall it later.

    Here is an example of how to use the `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` class:

    ```python
    from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryBufferMemory

    memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=50)
    memory.save_context({"input": "Hello"}, {"output": "What's up"})
    memory.save_context({"input": "Not much, just hanging"},
                        {"output": "Cool"})
    memory.save_context({"input": "What is on the schedule today?"}, 
                        {"output": f"{news}"})

    memory.load_memory_variables({})

    conversation = ConversationChain(
        llm=llm, 
        memory = memory,
        verbose=True
    )

    conversation.predict(input="What would be a good demo to show?")
    ```

    In the above example, the `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` class is used to store the context of a conversation and
