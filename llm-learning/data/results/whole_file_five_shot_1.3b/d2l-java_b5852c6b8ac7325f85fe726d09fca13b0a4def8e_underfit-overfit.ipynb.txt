    The code you provided is a Spark MLflow pipeline that uses the Deep Java Library (DJL) to train a machine learning model. The model is trained to fit a polynomial function to the data, and then the model's weights are used to predict the labels for new data.

    The code is divided into several sections:

    1. Importing necessary libraries and modules.
    2. Configuring the Spark environment.
    3. Loading the UniProt dataset.
    4. Defining utility functions.
    5. Training the model.
    6. Evaluating the model.
    7. Plotting the training and test loss.

    The model is trained for a maximum of 20 degrees of the polynomial, and the model's weights are used to predict the labels for new data. The code also demonstrates how to train the model for different degrees of the polynomial, and how to plot the training and test loss.

    The code is written in Scala, and it uses the Spark MLflow library for version control and tracking.

    Please note that the code is a simplified version of the original code and may not work as expected. The code is written for demonstration purposes and may not work as expected in a real-world scenario.
