    The code is written in Python and uses several libraries such as numpy, pandas, scipy, and pywt. The code is designed to extract features from EEG signals, such as time domain features, frequency domain features, and correlation. The features extracted include mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, standard deviation, median, zero crossing rate, coefficient of variation, root mean square, peak to peak, and sample entropy. The code is divided into functions to make it easier to read and maintain.

    The functions are:

    1. `leftRightHemisphericChannels`: This function is used to extract left and right hemispheric channels from a DataFrame.

    2. `averageChannels`: This function is used to extract the average channels from a DataFrame.

    3. `computeTimeDomainFeatures`: This function is used to compute time domain features for a given signal.

    4. `psd`: This function is used to compute the power spectral density of a signal.

    5. `computeCorrelation`: This function is used to compute the correlation between two signals.

    6. `featureExtractionLeftRight`: This function is used to extract features from left and right hemispheric channels.

    7. `featureExtractionAverage`: This function is used to extract features from the average channels.

    8. `featureExtractionFull`: This function is used to extract features from a DataFrame.

    The code is also divided into cells to make it easier to read and understand.
