    The commit message "Fixing FashionMnist util errors. (#8)" is about fixing the utilities in the FashionMnist class in the ai.djl.basicdataset package. The utilities are used to load and preprocess the FashionMnist dataset. The issue was that the utilities were not properly handling the dataset, which was causing errors when trying to load the dataset. The commit fixes this by properly handling the dataset and providing a more user-friendly interface for loading the dataset.
