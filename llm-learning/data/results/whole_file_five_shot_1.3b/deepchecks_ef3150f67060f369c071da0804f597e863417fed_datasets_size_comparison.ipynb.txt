    The code you've provided is a DeepChecks example. DeepChecks is a library for automated machine learning inspection. It provides a set of checks to evaluate the quality of machine learning models.

    The code is used to compare the size of the training and test datasets. It checks if the size of the test dataset is not smaller than the size of the training dataset, and if the ratio of the size of the test dataset to the size of the training dataset is not smaller than 0.2.

    The `run` method of the `check_instance` object is used to execute the checks and print the results.

    Please note that the code provided is a part of a larger pipeline and it's not a standalone example.
