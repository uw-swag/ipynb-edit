    The commit message "[issue-650] functionality split (#751)" suggests that the functionality of the DeepChecks library has been split into two separate checks. The first check, MixedNulls, checks for null values in the dataframe. The second check, MixedTypes, checks for different types of null values.

    The original code cells are not provided, but the functionality of the MixedNulls and MixedTypes checks can be seen in the code.

    The issue-650 is the issue number, and the #751 is the pull request number.

    The pull request is not yet merged, so the functionality of the checks is not yet implemented.
