```
    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses PyTorch and FastAI to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification on the Chest X-Ray dataset.

    The notebook starts with importing necessary libraries and modules, then it mounts Google Drive to access the dataset, downloads the dataset, and sets up the data loaders for training, validation, and testing.

    The notebook then defines a custom data block for the Chest X-Ray dataset, which includes resizing and augmenting the images. The data block is then used to create data loaders for training, validation, and testing.

    The notebook then defines a custom loss function for the XFocalLoss, which is a variant of the standard Cross-Entropy loss function with a focal loss structure. This loss function is used to train the model.

    The notebook then defines a custom architecture for the model, which is an implementation of the XResNet34 architecture, and trains the model using the defined loss function and optimizer.

    The notebook then saves the trained model and the data loaders, and clears the GPU memory to free up memory.

    Finally, the notebook provides an example of how to use the trained model to make predictions on the test set.

    Please note that the code provided is a basic example and may not work as expected. It is recommended to run this code in a Jupyter notebook environment to see the results.
