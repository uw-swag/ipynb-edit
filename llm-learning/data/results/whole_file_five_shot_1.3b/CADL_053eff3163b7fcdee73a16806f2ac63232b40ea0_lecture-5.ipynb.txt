    The code you provided seems to be a part of a larger codebase, and it's not clear what the specific issues are. However, here are a few general suggestions:

1. The code seems to be missing the part where it defines the `CELEB` dataset. This dataset is used in the code to load the images.

2. The code seems to be missing the part where it defines the `create_input_pipeline` function. This function is used to create a generator that can be used to feed data into the model.

3. The code seems to be missing the part where it defines the `n_epochs` and `batch_size` variables. These variables are used to control the training process.

4. The code seems to be missing the part where it defines the `input_shape` and `crop_shape` variables. These variables are used to control the input to the model.

5. The code seems to be missing the part where it defines the `crop_factor` variable. This variable is used to control the size of the cropping operation.

6. The code seems to be missing the part where it defines the `sequence_length` variable. This variable is used to control the length of the sequence.

7. The code seems to be missing the part where it defines the `n_cells` and `n_layers` variables. These variables are used to control the architecture of the model.

8. The code seems to be missing the part where it defines the `learning_rate` variable. This variable is used to control the learning rate of the optimizer.

9. The code seems to be missing the part where it defines the `clip` variable. This variable is used to control the clipping value in the Adam optimizer.

10. The code seems to be missing the part where it defines the `n_chars` variable. This variable is used to control the number of characters in the vocabulary.

Please provide more specific issues to address so I can provide a more accurate response.
