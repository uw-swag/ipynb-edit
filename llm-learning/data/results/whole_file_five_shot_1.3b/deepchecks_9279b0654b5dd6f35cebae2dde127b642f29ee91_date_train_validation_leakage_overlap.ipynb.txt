    The code provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook and it's not clear what the purpose of the code is. It seems to be a part of a data leakage check, which is a common problem in machine learning. The code is checking for a potential data leakage in the training and test datasets.

    However, the code provided is incomplete and does not provide a clear explanation of what it does. It's also not clear what the expected output of the code is.

    If you could provide more context or clarify what you expect the code to do, I would be happy to help you further.
