    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook that uses the Deepchecks library to perform a train-test drift check. The drift check is used to detect if the features in the training dataset and the test dataset are different from each other.

    The code first imports necessary libraries and sets a seed for reproducibility. It then creates a training and test dataset. The training dataset has a column for numeric features with and without drift, a column for categorical features with and without drift, and a target column. The test dataset also has the same columns as the training dataset, but with some randomness added to the numeric features and categorical features.

    The code then creates a pipeline that handles the categorical features. The pipeline first passes the categorical features through an ordinal encoder, and then passes the encoded features through a decision tree classifier. The pipeline is then fitted to the training dataset.

    The code then runs the train-test drift check on the training and test datasets. The check is run on the fitted model, and the results are printed.

    The code also adds a condition to the check to ensure that the drift score for the numeric features in the test dataset is not greater than the drift score for the numeric features in the training dataset. This condition is then run on the check, and the results are printed.

    The code ends with a few print statements to display the results of the check and the condition.

    Please note that the code is a part of a Jupyter notebook and it uses the Deepchecks library. If you are not using a Jupyter notebook, you would need to run the code in a Python environment that supports the Deepchecks library.
