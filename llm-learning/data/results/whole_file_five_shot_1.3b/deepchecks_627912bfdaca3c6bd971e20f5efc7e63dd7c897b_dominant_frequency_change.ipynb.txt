```python
    # Refactor notebook folder structure
    import os
    import shutil

    # Define the source and destination folders
    source_folder = '../input/'
    destination_folder = '../course_data/'

    # Get a list of all files in the source folder
    files = os.listdir(source_folder)

    # Create the destination folder if it doesn't exist
    if not os.path.exists(destination_folder):
        os.makedirs(destination_folder)

    # Move each file from the source folder to the destination folder
    for file in files:
        shutil.move(os.path.join(source_folder, file), destination_folder)

    print("Notebook folder structure has been refactored successfully.")
    ```
    '''

    ### Response:
    The code above is a simple script that moves all the files from the source folder to the destination folder. This is a common practice when organizing a project or a course. The `shutil.move()` function is used to move a file from one directory to another. The `os.path.join()` function is used to create a complete file path.

    The `os.listdir()` function is used to get a list of all files in the source folder. The `os.makedirs()` function is used to create a new directory.

    The refactored notebook folder structure is a good practice for organizing the files and folders in a project or a course. It helps in maintaining the code and making it easier to navigate.

    Please note that this script assumes that the source folder and the destination folder are in the same directory. If they are in different directories, you will need to adjust the source_folder and destination_folder accordingly.

    Also, this script does not handle any errors that may occur during the file moving process. In a production environment, you would want to add error handling code to deal with any potential issues.
