    The code you provided is a part of a larger codebase that uses the evidently library to analyze and visualize regression performance and data drift. The code is divided into several sections, each of which is responsible for a specific task.

    Here's a brief explanation of the sections:

    1. **Importing necessary libraries and modules**: This section imports the necessary libraries and modules for the code to run.

    2. **Data loading and preprocessing**: This section downloads a dataset from a URL, loads it into a pandas DataFrame, and preprocesses it by adding new features.

    3. **Feature engineering**: This section creates new features from the existing ones.

    4. **Model training**: This section trains a RandomForestRegressor model on a subset of the data.

    5. **Model prediction**: This section makes predictions on the current and reference data.

    6. **Dashboard generation**: This section uses the evidently library to generate dashboards for regression performance and data drift.

    7. **Data saving**: This section saves the dashboards to HTML files for later use.

    8. **Data drift analysis**: This section performs data drift analysis on the data.

    Each section is responsible for a specific task and the code in each section is well-commented to explain what it does.

    Please note that the code you provided is a simplified version of the original code and may not work as expected. It's a starting point and you may need to adjust it according to your specific needs.
