The warning message is about the use of a deprecated API, `argparse`, in the code. The `argparse` module is deprecated and its use is not recommended. It's recommended to use `click` or `fire` libraries for command-line argument parsing.

The font and plot style in the code are changed to 'darkgrid' and 'seaborn'. The code is also modified to use the `gifts` function to generate weights for each gift type.

The code is also modified to generate 1000 bags of gifts, with each bag containing 3 different types of gifts. The weights of the gifts are calculated and displayed using a seaborn distribution plot.

The code is also modified to calculate the standard distribution of the gifts into bags, and to remove bags that are over 50lbs.

The code is also modified to write the weights of the gifts into a CSV file.

The code is also modified to count the number of occurrences of each gift type in the data.

The code is also modified to calculate the sum of the weights of the gifts.
