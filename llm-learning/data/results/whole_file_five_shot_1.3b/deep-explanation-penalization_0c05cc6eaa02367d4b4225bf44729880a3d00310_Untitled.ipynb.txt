```python
    import cv2

    # Dilation
    kernel = np.ones((5,5),np.uint8)
    dilation = cv2.dilate(edges, kernel, iterations = 1)

    # Segmentation
    sure_bg = cv2.distanceTransform(dilation, 2, 5)
    sure_bg = np.uint8(sure_bg)
    sure_bg = cv2.erode(sure_bg, kernel, iterations = 1)

    # Background to unknown
    sure_fg = cv2.subtract(sure_bg, edges)

    # Foreground to object
    markers = cv2.watershed(img)
    img[markers == -1] = [255, 0, 0]

    # Display the image
    plt.imshow(img)
    plt.show()
    ```

    This code will add dilation to the segmentation process to actually penalize the detection of certain features. The dilation process is used to increase the size of the foreground objects, which in turn helps in detecting more objects.
