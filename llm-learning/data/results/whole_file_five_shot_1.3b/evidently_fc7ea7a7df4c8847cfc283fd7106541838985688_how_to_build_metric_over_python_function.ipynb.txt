```python
    # Define a custom metric
    def custom_metric(y_true, y_pred):
        # Compute the metric here
        # For example, we can compute the mean squared error
        mse = np.mean((y_true - y_pred)**2)
        return mse

    # Use the custom metric as a metric in a Keras model
    model.compile(loss=custom_metric, optimizer='adam')
    ```

    This is a simple example of how to implement a custom metric in Keras. The custom_metric function computes the mean squared error between the true and predicted values. This function is then used as a metric in the model's compilation step.
