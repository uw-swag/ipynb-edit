    The code you provided is a set of Jupyter notebook cells. Each cell is a piece of code that performs a specific task. Here's a brief explanation of what each cell does:

1. `<Cell_0>`: This cell is used to import the necessary libraries and functions.

2. `<Cell_1>`: This cell is used to import the necessary libraries and functions.

3. `<Cell_2>`: This cell defines a function `logistic` that calculates the logistic function.

4. `<Cell_3>`: This cell plots the logistic function.

5. `<Cell_4>`: This cell loads a dataset, preprocesses it, and splits it into training, validation, and test sets.

6. `<Cell_5>`: This cell defines a function `premodel` that creates a pre-trained model.

7. `<Cell_6>`: This cell defines a function `cb` that creates callback functions for early stopping and model checkpointing.

8. `<Cell_7>`: This cell resizes the images and displays them.

9. `<Cell_8>`: This cell defines a function `display_resize` that resizes the images.

10. `<Cell_9>`: This cell defines a function `premodel` that creates a pre-trained model.

11. `<Cell_10>`: This cell loads a pre-trained model and evaluates it on the test set.

12. `<Cell_11>`: This cell defines a function `premodel` that creates a pre-trained model.

13. `<Cell_12>`: This cell defines a function `premodel` that creates a pre-trained model.

14. `<Cell_13>`: This cell defines a function `premodel` that creates a pre-trained model.

15. `<Cell_14>`: This cell loads a pre-trained model and evaluates it on the test set.

16. `<Cell_15>`: This cell defines a function `premodel` that creates a pre-trained model.

17. `<Cell_16>`: This cell defines
