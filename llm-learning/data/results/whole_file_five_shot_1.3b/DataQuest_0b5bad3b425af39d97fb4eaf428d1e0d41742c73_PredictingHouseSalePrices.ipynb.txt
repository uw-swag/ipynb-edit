    The code provided is a refinement of a machine learning model for predicting house sale prices. The model uses the Linear Regression algorithm from the sklearn library. The model is trained on the training data and then tested on the test data.

    The code first reads the data from the 'AmesHousing.txt' file, then it selects the features and the target variable for the model. The model is trained and tested, and the root mean square error (RMSE) is calculated.

    The code then transforms the data by making a copy of the training data and selecting the numerical columns. It then checks the percentage of missing values in each column and drops the columns with more than 5% missing values.

    The code then encodes the categorical variables in the data. It drops the 'Order' and 'PID' columns, and creates dummy variables for the 'MS SubClass' column.

    The code then calculates the 'years_until_remod' and 'age_when_sold' columns, which are useful for predicting house prices.

    The final step is to print the columns of the transformed data.

    The code is a good example of how to refine a machine learning model for predicting house sale prices.
