    The code you provided is a series of operations that involve data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Here's a brief explanation of what each part of the code does:

    1. The first part imports the necessary libraries and modules.

    2. The next part imports the adult dataset from the sklearn datasets module.

    3. The adult dataset is then split into a reference dataset (adult_ref) and a current dataset (adult_cur). The current dataset is then augmented with some missing values.

    4. The next part imports the housing dataset from the sklearn datasets module.

    5. The housing dataset is then augmented with a new column 'prediction' that is a random normal distribution.

    6. The next part imports the breast cancer dataset from the sklearn datasets module.

    7. The breast cancer dataset is then split into a reference dataset (bcancer_ref) and a current dataset (bcancer_cur).

    8. The next part creates a RandomForestClassifier model and trains it on the reference dataset.

    9. The current dataset is then predicted using the trained model.

    10. The next part imports the iris dataset from the sklearn datasets module.

    11. The iris dataset is then split into a reference dataset (iris_ref) and a current dataset (iris_cur).

    12. The next part creates a RandomForestClassifier model and trains it on the reference dataset.

    13. The current dataset is then predicted using the trained model.

    14. The next part imports the DataDriftPreset from the evidently library.

    15. The DataDriftPreset is run on the reference and current datasets.

    16. The next part imports the DataQualityPreset from the evidently library.

    17. The DataQualityPreset is run on the reference and current datasets.

    18. The next part imports the RegressionPreset from the evidently library.

    19. The RegressionPreset is run on the reference and current datasets.

    20. The next part imports the ClassificationPreset from the evidently library.

    21. The ClassificationPres
