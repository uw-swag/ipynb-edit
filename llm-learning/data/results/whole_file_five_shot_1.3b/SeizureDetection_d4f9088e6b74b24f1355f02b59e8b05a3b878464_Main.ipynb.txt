The issue with the code is that it seems to be missing the download dataset functionality. The code is trying to download a dataset from a config file, but it's not clear what the function for downloading the dataset is. 

If you're using a library like `pandas` to read the dataset, you should be able to use the `read_csv` or `read_excel` function to download the dataset. 

Here's an example of how you might download a dataset using `pandas`:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'url' is the URL of the dataset
url = 'https://example.com/dataset.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(url)

# Save the dataframe to a csv file
df.to_csv('dataset.csv', index=False)
```

If you're not using `pandas` to download the dataset, you'll need to find a different way to do it. This could be a web scraping script, a script that downloads a file from a URL, or something else entirely. 

Please provide more details about the functionality you need if you need help with that.
