    The commit message "Upgrade to djl 0.13.0 (#176)" is a change in the development version of the Deep Java Library (djl). The change includes the introduction of a new CenteredLayer class, which is used to center the input of a block. The CenteredLayer class is a subclass of AbstractBlock and overrides the forwardInternal method to subtract the mean from the input. The CenteredLayer class also overrides the getOutputShapes method to return the same shape as the input.

    The code in the cell below is an example of how to use the CenteredLayer class. It creates a new CenteredLayer instance, sets it as the block of a Model, and then uses a Predictor to predict on an input.

    The commit message "Upgrade to djl 0.13.0 (#176)" is a good practice to include in your commit messages when you are making changes to the library. This helps others understand the changes you have made and why they should be using the new version.
