```python
    # Adding files via upload
    from google.cloud import storage

    def upload_blob(bucket_name, source_file_name, destination_blob_name):
        """Uploads a file to the bucket."""
        # bucket_name = "your-bucket-name"
        # source_file_name = "local/path/to/file"
        # destination_blob_name = "storage-object-name"

        storage_client = storage.Client()
        bucket = storage_client.bucket(bucket_name)
        blob = bucket.blob(destination_blob_name)

        blob.upload_from_filename(source_file_name)

        print(
            "File {} uploaded to {}.".format(
                source_file_name, destination_blob_name
            )
        )
    ```
    You can use this function to upload files to your Google Cloud Storage bucket.

    Please replace `bucket_name`, `source_file_name`, and `destination_blob_name` with your actual values.

    Also, make sure you have the Google Cloud SDK installed and you have authenticated with your Google Cloud account.

    This function uses the `google-cloud-storage` library, so make sure you have it installed. You can install it using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install google-cloud-storage
    ```

    And you need to authenticate with your Google Cloud account. You can do this by setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of your service account key JSON file.

    For example, if your key JSON file is at `/home/user/Downloads/my-key.json`, you would set the environment variable like this:

    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/home/user/Downloads/my-key.json"
    ```

    Then you can run the `upload_blob` function.
