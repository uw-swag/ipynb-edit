    This code is a part of a Jupyter notebook and it's written in Python. It uses several libraries and dependencies, including:

    1. `ai.djl`: This is a deep learning library for Java. It provides a high-level API for building and training machine learning models.

    2. `ai.djl.ndarray`: This is a high-performance multi-dimensional array library for Java. It provides a flexible and efficient way to handle numerical data.

    3. `ai.djl.ndarray.index`: This is a package for indexing multi-dimensional arrays in Java. It provides a way to specify the location of data in an array.

    4. `tech.tablesaw`: This is a data analysis library for Java. It provides a flexible and easy-to-use interface for creating, manipulating, and visualizing data.

    5. `tech.tablesaw.api`: This is the main API for the Tablesaw library. It provides a set of classes and methods for creating, manipulating, and analyzing data.

    6. `tech.tablesaw.plotly.api`: This is the API for the Plotly visualization library. It provides a way to create interactive plots.

    7. `tech.tablesaw.plotly.components`: This is the component library for the Plotly visualization library. It provides a set of components for creating different types of plots.

    8. `tech.tablesaw.api.FloatColumn`: This is a column of floating-point numbers. It provides a way to store and manipulate data in a column.

    9. `org.apache.commons.lang3.ArrayUtils`: This is a utility class that provides static methods for manipulating arrays.

    The code also includes a function `normal` that calculates the normal distribution of a given array.

    The code also includes a function `combine3` that combines three arrays into one.

    The code also includes a function `plot_normal_distributions` that creates a line plot of the normal distributions of three arrays.

    The code also includes a function `combine3` that combines three arrays into one.

    The code also includes a function `plot_normal_
