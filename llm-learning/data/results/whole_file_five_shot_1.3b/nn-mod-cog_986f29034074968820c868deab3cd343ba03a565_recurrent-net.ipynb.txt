    The code you provided is a comprehensive guide to implementing a deep learning model for a specific task, such as image classification or sentiment analysis. 

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The first part imports necessary libraries and sets up a notebook environment.

    - The second part creates a simple line chart using the Altair library.

    - The third part defines a simple recurrent neural network model using Keras.

    - The fourth part defines a simple LSTM model using Keras.

    - The fifth part loads the IMDB dataset, which is a collection of movie reviews, and preprocesses the data.

    - The sixth part prints the shape of the training and testing data.

    - The seventh part decodes the first 10 words of the first sequence in the training data.

    - The eighth part pads the sequences to the same length, and prints the shapes of the training and testing data.

    - The ninth part defines a model with an Embedding layer, an LSTM layer, and a Dense output layer.

    - The tenth part compiles and fits the model to the training data.

    - The eleventh part prints the final training and validation accuracy.

    - The twelfth part evaluates the model on the testing data and prints the test loss and accuracy score.

    This code should help you understand the basics of deep learning in Python.
