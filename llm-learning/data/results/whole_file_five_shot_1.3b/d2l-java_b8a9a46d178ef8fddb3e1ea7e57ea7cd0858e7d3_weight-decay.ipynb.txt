    The code you provided seems to be a mix of Maven dependencies and Jupyter notebook cells. 

    The first part of the code is setting up the Maven repository and loading some dependencies. The dependencies are AI libraries for deep learning, including Deep Java Library (DJL) and MXNet.

    The second part of the code is importing necessary libraries and defining some functions. These include:

    - `loadArray`: This function is used to load a batch of data into an ArrayDataset.
    - `l2Penalty`: This function calculates the L2 penalty of a weight vector.
    - `train`: This function trains a linear regression model with L2 penalty. It also logs the training loss and epoch count.
    - `train_djl`: This function trains a model using the Deep Java Library (DJL) and MXNet. It also includes a weight decay parameter.

    The last part of the code is running the training functions and plotting the training loss and epoch count.

    The code seems to be for training a linear regression model with L2 penalty using the DJL and MXNet.

    However, the code you provided is incomplete and does not seem to contain any errors or issues. It should work as expected.
