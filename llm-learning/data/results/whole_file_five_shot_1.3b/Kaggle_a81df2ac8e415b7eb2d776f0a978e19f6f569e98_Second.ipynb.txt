    The code you've provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses PyTorch, pandas, and other libraries to perform a machine learning task. The task is to train a YOLO (You Only Look Once) model on a dataset.

    Here's a brief overview of what the code does:

    1. It imports necessary libraries and sets up some matplotlib and seaborn configurations.
    2. It reads in the training, test, and macro datasets.
    3. It merges the datasets based on the 'timestamp' column.
    4. It encodes categorical variables in the datasets.
    5. It calculates the IQR (Interquartile Range) and outliers for the 'price_doc' column.
    6. It calculates the 'ratio_kitch_sq_life_sq', 'ratio_kitch_sq_full_sq', 'ratio_life_sq_full_sq', 'extra_sq', 'floor_from_top', 'ratio_floor_max_floor', 'ratio_preschool', and 'ratio_school' columns.
    7. It normalizes the dataset by setting missing values to the mean of the column.
    8. It creates new features from the 'timestamp' column.
    9. It trains a XGBoost model on the training dataset.
    10. It makes predictions on the test dataset and writes the predictions to a CSV file.

    Please note that the code is incomplete and may not work as expected. It's a starting point and you may need to adjust the code according to your specific needs.
