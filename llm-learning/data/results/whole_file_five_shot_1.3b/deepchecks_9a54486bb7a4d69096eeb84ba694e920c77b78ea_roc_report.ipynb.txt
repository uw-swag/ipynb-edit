    ### Response:
    The commit message "[issue-650] functionality split (#751)" suggests that the functionality of the code has been split into two distinct branches. The first branch is the original code, and the second branch is a new branch that includes the functionality of the RocReport check. This is a common practice in software development to separate the different features of the code into different branches.

    The commit message "#751" is a reference to a specific issue or task that this code is part of. It could be a bug report, a feature request, or a task that is being worked on. The
