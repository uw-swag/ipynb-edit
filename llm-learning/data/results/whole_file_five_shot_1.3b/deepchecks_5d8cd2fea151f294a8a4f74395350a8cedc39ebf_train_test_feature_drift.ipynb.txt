    The commit message "Update drift plot title (#971)" is updating the title of the drift plot. The title is currently set to "Feature Drift". The new title is "Feature Drift (PSI Score: 0.2, Earth Mover's Distance: 0.1)".

    The updated code is as follows:

    ```python
    result.value
    result.value.plot(title="Feature Drift (PSI Score: 0.2, Earth Mover's Distance: 0.1)")
    ```

    This line of code is adding a title to the plot returned by the `show()` method of the `result` object. The title is set to "Feature Drift (PSI Score: 0.2, Earth Mover's Distance: 0.1)".
