```python
    <Cell_0>
    from jupyterlite.utils import upload_files

    await upload_files("path_to_your_files")
    <\Cell_0>
    ```

    This code will upload files from the specified path to the JupyterLite server. Please replace "path_to_your_files" with the actual path to the files you want to upload.

    Note: The `upload_files` function is asynchronous, so you need to use the `await` keyword to run it.
