    The code you provided is a demonstration of how to use the DeepChecks library to perform a dataset size comparison check. The DeepChecks library is a Python library for data quality checks, which can be used to ensure the quality of the data used for training and testing.

    The check is performed on a training and a test dataset. The check is designed to ensure that the size of the test dataset is not smaller than the size of the training dataset, and that the ratio of the size of the test dataset to the size of the training dataset is not smaller than 0.2.

    The `run` method of the `check_instance` object is used to perform the check and return a report of the results.

    The report will contain information about the number of instances in each dataset, the number of instances that failed the check, and the number of instances that passed the check.

    Please note that you need to have the DeepChecks library installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:

    ```
    pip install deepchecks
    ```
