    The code you've provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the deepchecks library to perform various data quality checks and model evaluations. The notebook is divided into several cells, each of which performs a specific task. The cells are as follows:

    1. Importing necessary libraries and modules.
    2. Loading the dataset.
    3. Displaying the first few rows of the dataset.
    4. Displaying the column names of the dataset.
    5. Checking the shape of the dataset.
    6. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
    7. Training a logistic regression model.
    8. Evaluating the model.
    9. Using a decision tree classifier.
    10. Using a gradient boosting classifier.
    11. Plotting the confusion matrix.
    12. Plotting the ROC curve.
    13. Plotting the feature importance.
    14. Removing outliers from the dataset.
    15. Saving the model.
    16. Loading the model.
    17. Predicting the labels for the test set.
    18. Calculating the accuracy of the model.
