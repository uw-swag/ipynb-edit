    The code provided is a demonstration of how to use the BME680 sensor to measure air quality and temperature, and the PMS5003 particle sensor to measure particulate matter. The data is then stored in a pandas DataFrame for easy analysis and visualization. The data is continuously updated and displayed in real-time using matplotlib.

    The code also includes a slider for each of the air quality parameters, a button to reset the values to their default, and a button to clear the data and start over. The data is also saved to a CSV file every time the button is clicked.

    Please note that this code is a demonstration and may not work as expected in all environments. It is recommended to run this code in a suitable environment, such as a Jupyter notebook or a Python script, to ensure it works as expected.

    Also, please make sure to install the necessary libraries (matplotlib, pandas, ipywidgets) using pip before running the code.

    Finally, the BME680 sensor and the PMS5003 sensor are connected to the Raspberry Pi. Make sure to connect these sensors to the correct GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi.

    The code also assumes that the BME680 and PMS5003 sensors are connected to the Raspberry Pi correctly and that the Raspberry Pi is running Python 3.6 or later.
