    The commit message "allow single GPU training on GoogleNet (#47)" suggests that the project is allowing for single GPU training on GoogleNet. This is a significant change from the previous version of the project, as it allows for training on a single GPU.

    The project is using the AI.djl library, which is a deep learning library for Java, Python, and C++. It provides a wide range of models and datasets, and it also supports training on multiple GPUs.

    However, the specifics of the change are not clear from the provided code. It seems to be a change in the project's configuration or setup, but without more context, it's hard to provide a more detailed explanation.
