    The commit message "Rename test presets (#402)" has been updated to reflect the changes made to the test presets. The test presets are used to define a set of tests that are applied to the data to evaluate its performance. The tests include features value tests, drift tests, and more. The tests are grouped into several categories such as 'DataQuality', 'DataStability', 'DataDrift', 'NoTargetPerformance', and more. The tests are run on the current data and the reference data. The reference data is used to compare the current data with the reference data. The current data is the data that the model is currently working on.
