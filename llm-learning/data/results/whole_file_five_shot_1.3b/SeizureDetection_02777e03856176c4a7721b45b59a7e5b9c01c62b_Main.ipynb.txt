    The commit message "Fix bug in PCA" suggests that there is a bug in the PCA implementation. The PCA implementation in the code is not working as expected, causing the results to be incorrect.

    The code seems to be reading data from a configuration file, which is not provided in the provided cells. The configuration file is expected to contain parameters for reading data, performing PCA, undersampling, oversampling, and other machine learning related parameters.

    The PCA implementation in the code seems to be incomplete. The code is supposed to perform PCA on the data, but the actual implementation of the PCA algorithm is not provided.

    The PCA implementation in the code seems to be missing the part where it performs undersampling or oversampling of the data. The code is supposed to perform undersampling or oversampling of the data before performing PCA, but the actual implementation of these steps is not provided.

    The PCA implementation in the code seems to be missing the part where it calculates the performance metrics. The code is supposed to calculate and store the performance metrics of the machine learning model, but the actual implementation of this step is not provided.

    The PCA implementation in the code seems to be missing the part where it trains the machine learning model. The code is supposed to train the machine learning model on the PCA transformed data, but the actual implementation of this step is not provided.

    The PCA implementation in the code seems to be missing the part where it tests the machine learning model. The code is supposed to test the machine learning model on a separate test set, but the actual implementation of this step is not provided.

    The PCA implementation in the code seems to be missing the part where it evaluates the model's performance. The code is supposed to evaluate the performance of the machine learning model, but the actual implementation of this step is not provided.

    The PCA implementation in the code seems to be missing the part where it saves the model. The code is supposed to save the trained machine learning model, but the actual implementation of this step is not provided.

    The PCA implementation in the code seems to be missing the part where it uses the model for prediction. The code is supposed to use the trained machine learning model for prediction, but the actual implementation of this step is not provided.

    The PCA implementation in the code seems
