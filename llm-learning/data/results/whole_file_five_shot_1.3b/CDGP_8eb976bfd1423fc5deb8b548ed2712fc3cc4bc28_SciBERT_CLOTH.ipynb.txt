```python
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

    def train_code(df, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42):
        X = df.drop(target, axis=1)
        y = df[target]
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=test_size, random_state=random_state)
        return X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test
    ```
    This function splits the data into a training set and a test set using sklearn's `train_test_split` function. The test size is set to 0.2, which means that 20% of the data will be used for testing and 80% for training. The random state is set to 42, which ensures that the splits are reproducible.
