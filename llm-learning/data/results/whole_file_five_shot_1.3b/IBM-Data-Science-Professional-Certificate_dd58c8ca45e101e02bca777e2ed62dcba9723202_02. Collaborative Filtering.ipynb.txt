    #@title Collaborative Filtering

    # Collaborative Filtering is a method used by recommendation systems to make predictions about the interests of a user by collecting preferences from many users.

    # Here, we will use the popular collaborative filtering algorithm called "User-User" or "Item-Item" Collaborative Filtering.

    # Import necessary libraries
    import pandas as pd
    from surprise import KNNWithMeans
    from surprise import Dataset
    from surprise import accuracy
    from surprise.model_selection import train_test_split

    # Load the movielens-100k dataset
    data = Dataset.load_builtin('ml-100k')

    # Use user-based collaborative filtering
    algo = KNNWithMeans(k=50, sim_options={'name': 'pearson_baseline', 'user_based': True})

    # Run 5-fold cross-validation and train the model
    cross_validate(algo, data, measures=['RMSE', 'MAE'], cv=5, verbose=True)

    # Predict a rating for a user-item pair
    # Predict a rating for a user
    algo.fit(data.buil
