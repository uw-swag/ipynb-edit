    The code you provided seems to be a part of a Jupyter notebook, and it's using the Deep Learning library DJL (Deep Java Library) to build a ResNet model for image classification. 

    The ResNet model is a type of convolutional neural network that is used for image classification tasks. It consists of several layers of residual connections, which allow it to learn efficient features.

    The code also includes importing necessary libraries, setting up the Maven repository, loading dependencies, defining a Residual class for building residual blocks, and building a ResNet model.

    The code also includes a function to render a line plot of the training loss, accuracy, and the average training time per epoch.

    However, the code you provided seems to be incomplete and doesn't seem to be running as expected. It seems like the code is missing some parts, such as the definition of the ResNet model, the training loop, and the evaluation of the model.

    Please provide the complete code so that I can help you debug it.
