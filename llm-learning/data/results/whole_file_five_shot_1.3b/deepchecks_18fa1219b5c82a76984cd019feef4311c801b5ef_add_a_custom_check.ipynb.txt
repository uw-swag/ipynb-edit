    The code you provided is a custom DeepChecks check that compares the sizes of the train and test datasets. The check is run with dummy data for the purpose of this demonstration.

    The check returns a CheckResult object that contains the sizes of the train and test datasets. The sizes are displayed as a bar graph, with the x-axis representing the dataset type (train or test) and the y-axis representing the size of the dataset.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The `DatasetSizeComparison` class inherits from `TrainTestBaseCheck`, which is a base class for all checks that compare the sizes of train and test datasets.

    - The `run` method of the `DatasetSizeComparison` class implements the logic of the check. It calculates the sizes of the train and test datasets and returns them as a dictionary.

    - The `sizes` dictionary contains the sizes of the train and test datasets.

    - The `sizes_df_for_display` variable is a DataFrame that represents the sizes of the train and test datasets, displayed as a bar graph.

    - The `graph_display` function is a function that creates a bar graph of the sizes of the train and test datasets.

    - The `return_value` of the `run` method is a dictionary that contains the sizes of the train and test datasets, and the `display` parameter of the `run` method is a list that contains the `sizes_df_for_display` and `graph_display` functions.

    - The `DatasetSizeComparison().run(train_dataset, test_dataset)` line runs the check with the dummy data and displays the results.

    This code should provide a good example of how to create a custom DeepChecks check.
