    The code you provided is a complete Python script for a machine learning project using the Titanic dataset. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    1. The first part of the code imports necessary libraries and loads the Titanic dataset.

    2. The second part checks for missing values in the dataset.

    3. The third part drops rows with any missing values.

    4. The fourth part drops rows where Age is missing.

    5. The fifth part calculates the mean Age.

    6. The sixth part calculates the median Age.

    7. The seventh part finds the most frequent Age.

    8. The eighth part replaces missing values for Age with the median age.

    9. The ninth part creates a DataFrame of dummy variables for the 'Embarked' feature.

    10. The tenth part concatenates the original DataFrame and the dummy DataFrame.

    11. The eleventh part splits the dataset into features (X) and target (y).

    12. The twelfth part splits the dataset into training and testing sets.

    13. The thirteenth part trains a logistic regression model on the training set.

    14. The fourteenth part makes predictions for the testing set.

    15. The fifteenth part calculates the accuracy of the model.

    16. The sixteenth part calculates the AUC of the model.

    17. The seventeenth part plots the ROC curve.

    18. The eighteenth part calculates the AUC of the model.

    19. The nineteenth part prints the first 10 predicted probabilities.

    20. The twentieth part calculates the square root of predicted probabilities.

    21. The twenty-first part calculates the AUC of the model.

    22. The twenty-second part plots the ROC curve.

    23. The twenty-third part calculates the AUC of the model.

    24. The twenty-fourth part calculates the cross-validated AUC of the model.
