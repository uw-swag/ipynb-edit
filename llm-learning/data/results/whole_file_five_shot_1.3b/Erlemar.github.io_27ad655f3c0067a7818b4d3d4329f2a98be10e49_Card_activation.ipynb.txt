    ## Card Activation

    The notebook `card_activation.ipynb` contains the code to perform card activation. This process involves the following steps:

    1. **Data Preprocessing**: This step involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and converting categorical variables to numerical variables.

    2. **Feature Engineering**: This step involves creating new features that might be useful for the model.

    3. **Model Training**: This step involves training a machine learning model on the preprocessed data. The model used is a Random Forest model.

    4. **Model Evaluation**: This step involves evaluating the performance of the model on a separate test set.

    5. **Model Optimization**: This step involves optimizing the model's parameters to improve its performance.

    6. **Prediction**: This step involves using the trained model to predict the card activation for new data.

    The notebook also includes a section for visualizing the results of the model, which can be useful for understanding the performance of the model.

    The PDF version of this notebook can be found in the `docs` directory.
