    The code you've provided is already in Python 2. It's already using the `__future__` imports for Python 2 compatibility.

    However, it's important to note that Python 3 is the current version of Python and is the recommended version for new development.

    If you're working on a project that requires Python 3 compatibility, you should ensure that you're using the appropriate imports and syntax for Python 3.

    If you're using an environment that supports Python 3, you can use the `python3` command to run your Python 3 code.

    If you're using an environment that doesn't support Python 3, you can use the `python` command to run your Python 2 code.

    If you're using an IDE that supports Python 3, you can use the IDE's built-in Python 3 support.

    If you're using a Jupyter notebook, you can use the `%%javascript` magic command to run JavaScript code.

    If you're using a web server, you can use the `%%javascript` magic command to run JavaScript code.
