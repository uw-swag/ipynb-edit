```
    ## Update the DeepChecks example
    ## The check 'DominantFrequencyChange' is used to check if the dominant frequency of a feature in the test set is significantly different from the dominant frequency in the training set.

    ## The check is run on the validation dataset and the training dataset.

    ## The check returns a DataFrame with the features that have a dominant frequency change in the test set.

    ## The check does not return any result, as the dominant frequency in the test set is significantly different from the dominant frequency in the training set.
