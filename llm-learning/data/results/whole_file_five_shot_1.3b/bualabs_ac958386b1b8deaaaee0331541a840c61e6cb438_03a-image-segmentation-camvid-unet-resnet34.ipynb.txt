    This notebook introduces the concept of instance segmentation and image classification. 

    Instance segmentation is a process in computer vision where an image is divided into multiple instances of the same object. It is a more complex form of object detection, where the model is trained to identify individual objects in the image.

    Image classification, on the other hand, is a process in computer vision where an image is classified into one of a number of categories. It is a more complex form of classification, where the model is trained to identify the category of an image.

    In this notebook, we are using the FastAI library, which is a high-level API for building and training deep learning models. It provides a set of tools and utilities to make it easier to build and train models.

    We are using the U-Net architecture for instance segmentation, and the ResNet34 architecture for image classification. We are also using the OneHotCallback for learning rate scheduling, and the MemFreeCallback for monitoring GPU memory usage.

    The notebook also includes a number of examples of how to use these techniques, including loading and preprocessing data, training a model, and evaluating its performance.
