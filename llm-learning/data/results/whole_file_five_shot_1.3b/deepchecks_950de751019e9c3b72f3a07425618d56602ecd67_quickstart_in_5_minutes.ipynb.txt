    The commit message "Fixing colab & notebook links (#309)" is related to the issue of links in the Jupyter notebook and Google Colab. 

    In Google Colab, the links to the notebook are not working. This is because Google Colab uses a different system for sharing and collaborating on notebooks. 

    To fix this, you can use the following steps:

    1. Click on the "File" menu in the top left corner.
    2. Select "Save and Checkpoint" to save your work.
    3. You will be prompted to name the checkpoint. Enter a name for your checkpoint.
    4. Click on the "Share" button in the top right corner.
    5. In the "Share with" section, select "Anyone with the link" and click on the "Copy link" button.
    6. Paste the link into your notebook.

    After you've done this, you should be able to access your notebook and its associated checkpoints from any other device.

    Please note that this is a workaround and may not be suitable for all situations. It's always a good idea to keep your notebooks and checkpoints synchronized across different platforms.
