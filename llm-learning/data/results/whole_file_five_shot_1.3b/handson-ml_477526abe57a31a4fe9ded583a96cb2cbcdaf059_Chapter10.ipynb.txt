    ## Chapter 10: Data Structures and Algorithms

    ### 1.1 Introduction to Data Structures

    #### 1.1.1 Definition of Data Structures

    Data structures are a way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. They are used to solve problems that are common in computer science, such as sorting, searching, and managing data.

    #### 1.1.2 Types of Data Structures

    There are several types of data structures in computer science, including:

    - **Arrays**: An array is a data structure that can store a fixed-size sequence of elements of the same type.

    - **Linked Lists**: A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Each element (node) of a linked list contains a reference to the next node in the sequence.

    - **Stacks**: A stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out).

    - **Queues**: A queue is a linear structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).

    - **Trees**: A tree is a widely used abstract data type (ADT) that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.

    - **Graphs**: A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.

    ### 1.2 Algorithms

    Algorithms are the step-by-step procedures or procedures that solve a problem or achieve a particular goal. They are the building blocks of any computer program.

    ### 1.3 Applications of Data Structures and Algorithms

    Data structures and algorithms are integral to many areas of computer science, including:

    - **Web Development**: Data structures and algorithms are used to manage and organize data in web applications.
