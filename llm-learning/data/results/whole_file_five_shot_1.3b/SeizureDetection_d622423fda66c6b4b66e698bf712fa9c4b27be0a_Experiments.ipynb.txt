    The commit message "Changes in feature classification parameters" suggests that the parameters of the feature classification methods have been updated. This could include changes in the number of features, the type of features, the normalization method, the undersampling method, the oversampling method, and the number of folds in the K-Fold cross-validation.

    The code cells in the commit message are related to the feature extraction, training, and testing of machine learning models. The feature extraction function is responsible for selecting and normalizing the features, while the training and testing functions are responsible for training and testing the models.

    The updated parameters could impact the performance of the models, as they can affect the complexity of the model, the accuracy of the model, and the computational cost of the model.
