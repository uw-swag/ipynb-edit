    ## 10.2.1: Introduction

    Attention pooling is a method used in machine learning to improve the performance of a model by providing a weighted sum of the input data. The weights are determined by the model's predictions. This is often used in the context of regression problems, where the goal is to predict a continuous output.

    ## 10.2.2: Nadaraya-Watson Kernel Regression

    Nadaraya-Watson Kernel Regression (NWKR) is a kernel method for regression that uses a Gaussian kernel to model the relationship between the input and output variables. The kernel function is defined as a weighted sum of the input data, where the weights are determined by the model's predictions.

    Attention pooling is a method used to improve the performance of a model by providing a weighted sum of the input data. The weights are determined by the model's predictions. This is often used in the context of regression problems, where the goal is to predict a continuous output.

    ## 10.2.4: Nadaraya-Watson Kernel Regression with Attention Pooling

    Nadaraya-Watson Kernel Regression with Attention Pooling is a kernel method for regression that uses a Gaussian kernel to model the relationship between the input and output variables. The kernel function is defined as a weighted sum of the input data, where the weights are determined by the model's predictions.

    ## 10.2.5: Conclusion

    Attention pooling is a powerful technique
