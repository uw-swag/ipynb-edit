    The commit message "Upgrade to djl 0.13.0 (#176)" is a release note for the Deep Java Library (DJL). DJL is a machine learning library for Java that provides a high-level API for building and training machine learning models.

    The DJL version 0.13.0 is a major release that includes several improvements and bug fixes.

    The main changes in this version include:

    1. **New Features**:
       - Added support for GPU acceleration in the RNNModelScratch and RNNModel classes.
       - Added support for batch normalization in the RNNModelScratch and RNNModel classes.
       - Added support for sequence-to-sequence models in the RNNModelScratch and RNNModel classes.
       - Added support for multi-GPU training in the TimeMachine class.

    2. **Improvements**:
       - Improved the performance of the RNNModelScratch and RNNModel classes.
       - Improved the accuracy of the RNNModelScratch and RNNModel classes.

    3. **Bug Fixes**:
       - Fixed a bug that caused the RNNModelScratch and RNNModel classes to fail when using the GPU.
       - Fixed a bug that caused the RNNModelScratch and RNNModel classes to fail when using the CPU.

    4. **Documentation**:
       - Added more detailed documentation for the RNNModelScratch and RNNModel classes.
       - Added more detailed documentation for the TimeMachine class.

    5. **Other**:
       - Updated the README file with the new features and improvements of the DJL version 0.13.0.
