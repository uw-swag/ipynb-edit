    The code you've provided is a collection of Python scripts that use various statistical and visualization libraries to analyze and test the data drift in different datasets. The code includes:

    - Importing necessary libraries and modules.
    - Defining functions to generate sample and control groups.
    - Generating sample data for different distributions (normal, gamma, binomial, and Poisson).
    - Applying statistical tests to detect data drift.
    - Visualizing the results of the tests.

    The code is designed to be modular and reusable, making it easy to modify or extend. However, it's important to note that the seaborn library is not included in the dependencies, as it's not a core part of the Python standard library. If you want to use seaborn for visualization, you'll need to install it separately.

    The code also includes a Mann-Whitney U-rank test, an Epps-Singleton test, and a function to create a dataframe with the results of the tests. The dataframe can be used to analyze the results of the tests and make decisions about the type of data drift.

    The code also includes a function to generate a histogram of the data, which can be used to visualize the distribution of the data.

    The code also includes a function to generate a line plot of the p-values for the tests, which can be used to visualize the distribution of the p-values.

    Finally, the code includes a function to generate a histogram of the data, which can be used to visualize the distribution of the data.
