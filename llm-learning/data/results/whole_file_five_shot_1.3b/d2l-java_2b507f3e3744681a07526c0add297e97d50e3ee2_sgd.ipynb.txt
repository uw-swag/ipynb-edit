The code you provided is a Maven project that uses the Deep Java Library (DJL) to train a model. The code includes import statements for various libraries and classes, as well as a function to generate random numbers from a normal distribution. The code also demonstrates how to use a learning rate scheduler to adjust the learning rate during training.

The code is divided into several sections:

1. Maven dependencies: These are the libraries that are used in the project.

2. Maven load commands: These commands are used to load the necessary Java files and classes.

3. Import statements: These are used to import the necessary classes and functions.

4. Random number generation: This section demonstrates how to generate random numbers from a normal distribution.

5. Learning rate scheduler: This section demonstrates how to use a learning rate scheduler to adjust the learning rate during training.

6. Training: This section demonstrates how to train a model using the SGD method.

7. Trace plot: This section generates a 2D trace plot of the training process.

8. Exponential and polynomial learning rate: These sections demonstrate how to use different learning rate schedulers.

Please note that the code provided is a simplified example and may not work as expected. It is recommended to run this code in a proper development environment to understand and test the functionality.
