    The commit message "Treinamento finalizado com 12 usu√°rios" indicates that the training process has been completed with 12 users. This is a significant milestone in the project.

    The code cells in the commit message are related to the training of a machine learning model using the TensorFlow library. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, a dataset of 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits. The model is then used to predict the user's emotional state based on the features extracted from the images.

    The model is trained using different types of classifiers, such as OneVsRest, OneVsOne, MultinomialNB, AdaBoostClassifier, LinearSVC, DecisionTreeClassifier, ExtraTreesRegressor, GaussianProcessClassifier, MLPClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis, and GaussianNB. The model with the highest accuracy score is selected as the best model.

    The code also includes the creation of a confusion matrix plot, which shows the performance of the model. The confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model on a set of test data for which the true values are known.

    The final part of the code is used to predict the user's emotional state based on the features extracted from the images. The model is trained on the full dataset and then used to predict the emotional state of new images. The predicted emotional state is then displayed to the user.

    The final commit message also mentions that the model has been trained and tested with 12 users, and the results of the model's performance are shown in a confusion matrix.
