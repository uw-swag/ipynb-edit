    ## Multi-Perceptron

    A multi-perceptron is a type of artificial neural network that uses a single perceptron to learn from the data. The perceptron is trained to recognize patterns in the data. The multi-perceptron is a generalization of the single perceptron.

    The multi-perceptron is a type of feedforward artificial neural network that is used for pattern recognition. It is a type of artificial neural network that uses a single perceptron to learn from the data. The perceptron is trained to recognize patterns in the data. The multi-perceptron is a generalization of the single perceptron.
