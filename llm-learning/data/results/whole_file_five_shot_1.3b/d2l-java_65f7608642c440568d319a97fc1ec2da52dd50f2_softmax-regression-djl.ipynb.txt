```
    The code you provided is a cleanup of the previous chapter on linear regression. It has removed unnecessary dependencies, fixed import statements, and added necessary import statements for the required libraries. The chapter also includes a cleanup of the code by removing unnecessary code and comments.

    However, it's important to note that the code you provided is a simplified example of a linear regression model. In a real-world scenario, you would need to handle more complex data preprocessing, model tuning, and evaluation steps.

    Also, the code you provided is for a specific version of the AI/ML library (DJL), which is a high-level library for building AI/ML models. The code is not specific to any particular model or dataset.

    Finally, the code you provided is for a specific Maven repository, which is a build automation tool for Java projects. The code is not specific to any particular Maven repository or project.

    Please let me know if you need help with anything else.
