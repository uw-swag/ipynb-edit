    The code you provided is splitting many files in core and base. The core part of the code is importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset. The base part of the code is using the LabelAmbiguity class from the deepchecks library to analyze the dataset.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - `<Cell_0>`: This cell imports the necessary libraries and functions.
    - `<Cell_1>`: This cell loads the phishing dataset from the deepchecks library.
    - `<Cell_2>`: This cell runs the LabelAmbiguity class on the phishing dataset.
    - `<Cell_3>`: This cell runs the LabelAmbiguity class on the phishing dataset, but only shows the first result.
    - `<Cell_4>`: This cell runs the LabelAmbiguity class on the phishing dataset, but only shows the results for the 'urlLength' and 'numDigits' columns.
    - `<Cell_5>`: This cell runs the LabelAmbiguity class on the phishing dataset, but only shows the results for the 'urlLength' and 'numDigits' columns, and only if the ratio of ambiguous samples to total samples is not greater than 0.

    Please note that the actual results of the code will depend on the specifics of the dataset you're using.
