    The code you've provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the Apache Maven and LightGBM libraries to implement the AlexNet and VGG networks. The notebook also includes code to load and preprocess data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

    However, the code you've provided is not complete and does not include the actual implementation of the AlexNet and VGG networks. The actual implementation of these networks would require a deep understanding of the architecture and the specific libraries used (like TensorFlow or PyTorch).

    Also, the code you've provided does not include the actual training of the models. The training of the models would require a dataset, a suitable loss function, and an optimizer.

    Finally, the code you've provided does not include the evaluation of the models' performance. The performance evaluation of the models would require a suitable evaluation metric.

    Please provide the complete implementation of the AlexNet and VGG networks, the training of the models, and the evaluation of the models' performance.
