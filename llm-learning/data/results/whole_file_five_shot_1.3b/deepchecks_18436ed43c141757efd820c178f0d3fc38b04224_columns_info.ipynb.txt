    ## Examples

    ### Code
    ```python
    # Import necessary libraries
    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

    # Load the California housing dataset
    housing = fetch_california_housing()

    # Split the dataset into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(housing.data, housing.target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Create a Random Forest Regressor
    regressor = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

    # Train the regressor
    regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions on the testing set
    y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test)

    # Calculate the mean squared error of the predictions
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

    print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
    ```
    ### Output
    The above code will load the California housing dataset, split it into a training set and a testing set, create a Random Forest Regressor, train it on the training set, make predictions on the testing set, and calculate the mean squared error of the predictions.

    The output will be the mean squared error of the predictions.
