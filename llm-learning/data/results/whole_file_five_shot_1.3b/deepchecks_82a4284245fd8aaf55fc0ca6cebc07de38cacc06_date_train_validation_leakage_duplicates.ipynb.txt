    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook and it's using Deepchecks library to detect duplicates in a dataset.

    The first part of the code is a function that creates a dataset from a dictionary. The dictionary contains a column 'col1' with a list of datetime objects. The function also takes an optional parameter 'datetime_name' which is the name of the datetime column.

    The second part of the code is an example of how to use the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check. This check is used to detect duplicates in the training and testing datasets. The `n_to_show` parameter is set to 1, which means that only the first duplicate found will be shown.

    The third part of the code is an example of how to use the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check with a different configuration. The `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` constructor is called with a dictionary as the configuration, and the `n_to_show` parameter is set to 2, which means that only the first two duplicates found will be shown.

    The last part of the code is an example of how to use the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check with a different test dataset. The test dataset contains a different set of datetime values, and the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check will detect any duplicates in this new dataset.

    Please note that the Deepchecks library is not installed in your environment. You can install it using pip:

    ```
    pip install deepchecks
    ```

    Also, please make sure that the datetime values in your test dataset are not duplicates of the datetime values in your training dataset. If they are, the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check will not detect any duplicates.

    Finally, the code is not running because it's not being executed. You need to run it to see the results.

    The code is not complete and there are some missing parts. For example, the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` check does not have a `run` method, and the `DateTrainTestLeakageDuplicates` constructor does not take any parameters.
