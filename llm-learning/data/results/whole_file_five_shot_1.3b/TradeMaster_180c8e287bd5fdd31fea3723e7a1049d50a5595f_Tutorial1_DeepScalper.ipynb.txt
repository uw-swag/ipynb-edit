The code you provided seems to be a part of a larger project, and it's not clear what the purpose of the code is. It seems to be a PyTorch-based reinforcement learning algorithm for trading. However, the code is incomplete and there are some missing parts. 

The missing parts are:

1. The `build_transition` function is not defined.
2. The `build_loss` function is not defined.
3. The `build_agent` function is not defined.
4. The `build_optimizer` function is not defined.
5. The `build_trainer` function is not defined.
6. The `build_dataset` function is not defined.
7. The `build_environment` function is not defined.

Please provide the complete code for these functions.
