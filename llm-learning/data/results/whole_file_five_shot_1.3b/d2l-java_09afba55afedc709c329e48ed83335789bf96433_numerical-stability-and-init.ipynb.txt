    The code you've provided is a mix of Maven dependencies, Java code, and Tableau Plotly code. Here's a brief explanation of what each part of the code does:

    1. Maven dependencies: These are used to import libraries and dependencies for your project. The `%maven` directives are used to add Maven dependencies to your notebook.

    2. Java code: This is a snippet of Java code that uses the DJL (Deep Java Library) library, which is a machine learning library for Java. It defines a simple neural network with a sigmoid activation function, calculates the gradient of the sigmoid function, and then multiplies a random matrix by itself 100 times.

    3. Tableau Plotly code: This is a snippet of Tableau Plotly code that creates a line plot of a table of data. The plot shows the gradient of the sigmoid function for the X values, and the groups of X values.

    Please note that the code you've provided is incomplete and may not work as expected. It's recommended to run the code in a complete Jupyter notebook environment to see the results.
