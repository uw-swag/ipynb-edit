    The code for the latent factor models and classifiers has been separated from the rest of the code. The classifiers are implemented using scikit-learn's various classifiers. The PCA, TSNE, and Isomap models are used for dimensionality reduction. The SparsePCA, KernelPCA, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gaussian Process models are used for classification. The code for these models is also provided.
