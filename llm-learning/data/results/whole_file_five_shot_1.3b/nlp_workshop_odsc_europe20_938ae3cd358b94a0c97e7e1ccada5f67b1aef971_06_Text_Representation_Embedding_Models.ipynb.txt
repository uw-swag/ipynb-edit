    ## Text Representation Learning

    Text representation learning is the process of converting text into a form that can be used for further processing. This is often done by converting the text into a numerical form, which can then be used for further processing.

    There are several types of text representation learning:

    1. **Word Embeddings**: These are a type of word representation that allows words with similar meaning to have a similar representation. The representation is a vector in a high-dimensional space.

    2. **Character Embeddings**: These are a type of character representation that allows characters with similar meaning to have a similar representation. The representation is a vector in a high-dimensional space.

    3. **Sequence Embeddings**: These are a type of sequence representation that allows sequences of words or characters to have a similar representation. The representation is a vector in a high-dimensional space.

    The goal of text representation learning is to learn a representation that can be used for various tasks, such as text classification, text generation, and more.

    ## Example: Word Embeddings

    Let's consider a simple example of word embeddings. We will use the GloVe word embeddings, which are pre-trained word embeddings.

    ```python
    from gensim.models import KeyedVectors

    # Load the GloVe word embeddings
    glove_vectors = KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format('glove.6B.100d.txt.w2v', binary=False)

    # Get the vector for a word
    word_vector = glove_vectors['computer']

    # Print the vector
    print(word_vector)
    ```

    This will print the vector for the word 'computer'. You can see that the vector is a 100-dimensional vector, where each dimension represents a different word in the vocabulary.

    ## Example: Character Embeddings

    Character embeddings are a type of word representation that allows characters with similar meaning to have a similar representation.

    Here is an example of character embeddings:

    ```python
    from gensim.models import KeyedVectors

    # Load the GloVe word
