    The code you provided is a set of Jupyter notebook cells. Each cell is designed to perform a specific task related to machine learning and deep learning. Here's a brief explanation of each cell:

    1. Cell_0: This cell is used to import the necessary libraries and modules for the rest of the notebook.

    2. Cell_1: This cell is used to define the URL for the MNIST dataset.

    3. Cell_2: This cell is used to define a function to get the MNIST dataset.

    4. Cell_3: This cell is used to define a function to normalize the data.

    5. Cell_4: This cell is used to create a Dataset class that can be used to load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.

    6. Cell_5: This cell is used to define a model class.

    7. Cell_6: This cell is used to define a function to get the model and loss function.

    8. Cell_7: This cell is used to normalize the data and define the batch size.

    9. Cell_8: This cell is used to define a function to fit the model.

    10. Cell_9: This cell is used to define a function to plot the metrics.

    11. Cell_10: This cell is used to define a model class.

    12. Cell_11: This cell is used to define a function to fit the model.

    13. Cell_12: This cell is used to define a learning rate and epoch number.

    14. Cell_13: This cell is used to define a function to fit the model.

    15. Cell_14: This cell is used to define a model class.

    16. Cell_15: This cell is used to define a function to fit the model.

    17. Cell_16: This cell is used to print the model.

    18. Cell_17: This cell is used to print the model layers.

    19. Cell_18: This cell is used to define a model class.

    20. Cell_19: This cell is used to define a function
