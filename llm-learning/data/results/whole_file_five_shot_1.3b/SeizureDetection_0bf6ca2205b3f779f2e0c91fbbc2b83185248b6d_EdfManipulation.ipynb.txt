    The code you provided seems to be a collection of functions for reading and processing EDF (Electroencephalogram) files. The functions are designed to read EDF files, extract data from them, and store the data in a pandas DataFrame.

    The functions are used in a main function, `read_and_store_data`, which is responsible for reading and processing the EDF files from a specified dataset folder. The function reads the EDF files, extracts the data, and stores it in a pandas DataFrame.

    The DataFrame is then returned by the function.

    The functions are designed to work with the channels specified in the `channels` parameter. The function reads the EDF files and extracts the data for the specified number of channels.

    The function is called with the dataset folder, the sample rate, and the number of channels as arguments. The function returns a pandas DataFrame containing the data from the EDF files.

    The function is used in a Jupyter notebook to demonstrate how to use the functions.

    The functions are not meant to be used directly, but rather as a part of a larger program that uses the functions to process EDF files.

    The functions are not designed to be used in a real-world application, as they are not designed to handle real-world data. They are designed to handle data from EDF files, which is not a common format.

    The functions are not designed to handle different types of data, such as seizures, as they are not designed to handle seizures.
