    This code defines a simple gradient descent function, which iteratively updates the value of a variable (in this case, x) based on a gradient computed at each iteration. The gradient is a function of the current value of x, and the learning rate determines how much to update x at each iteration. The history of the values of x at each iteration is plotted to visualize the progress of the gradient descent.
