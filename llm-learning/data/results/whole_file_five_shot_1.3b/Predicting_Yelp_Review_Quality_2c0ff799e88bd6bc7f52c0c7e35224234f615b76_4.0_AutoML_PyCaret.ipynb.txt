    # Python File Naming Conventions

    This project follows the PEP8 style guide for Python code. Here are the naming conventions:

    1. All Python files should start with `python_`.
    2. All data files should start with `data_`.
    3. All model files should start with `model_`.
    4. All notebooks should start with `notebook_`.
    5. All scripts should start with `script_`.
    6. All images should start with `img_`.
    7. All other files should start with `_`.
    ```

    This will help others understand the structure of your project and make it easier to navigate.
