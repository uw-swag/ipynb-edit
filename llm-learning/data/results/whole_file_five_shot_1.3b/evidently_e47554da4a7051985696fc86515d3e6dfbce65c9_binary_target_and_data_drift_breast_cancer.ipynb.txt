    ### Overview
    This notebook is designed to demonstrate the usage of the Evidently library in Python for data drift and target drift analysis.

    ### How to Use
    The notebook is divided into several sections. The first section provides an example of how to use the DataDriftTab and CatTargetDriftTab from the evidently library. The second section demonstrates how to use the Dashboard class to visualize the results of these analyses. The third section demonstrates how to use the Profile class to generate a report of the data drift and target drift.

    ### Examples

        - Day 4 Notebooks updated to work on the server.
        - Removed examples with an dashboards and profiles from sample_notebooks.
        - Updated readme with examples of how to use the Dashboard, Profile, and Tab classes.
        - Added an example with test generators usage to how_to_questions.
