    ## Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)

    A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is a class of artificial neural network model, which is a feedforward artificial neural network. It consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The weights and biases of the network are learned during training.

    The MLP is widely used in various fields such as image processing, speech recognition, and machine learning.

    ## Creating Training Data

    The XOR problem is a binary classification problem where the input is a binary vector of length 2 and the output is a binary value. The XOR problem can be represented as follows:

    - Two features are used: f1 and f2.
    - The target is the XOR of the two features.
    - The features are generated using a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
    - The number of samples is 100.

    ## Setting up Keras Model

    The Keras library in Python is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.

    ## Training and Testing Keras Model

    The model is trained using the training data and the target vector. The model is then tested on the test data and the target vector.

    ## Computing Metrics

    The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model are the accuracy and the precision.

    The accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions.

    The precision is the ratio of the number of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives.

    The scikit-learn library in Python provides functions to compute these metrics.

    ## Plotting Training Data

    The training data is plotted using matplotlib. The scatter function is used to plot the data. The x-axis represents the first feature and the y-axis represents the second feature.
