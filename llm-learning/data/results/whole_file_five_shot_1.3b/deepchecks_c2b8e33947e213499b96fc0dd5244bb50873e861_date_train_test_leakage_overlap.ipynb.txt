    The code you provided is for a Deepchecks check that checks for train-test leakage overlap. This is a common issue in machine learning where the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance, and the test set is used to make predictions on the same data.

    The check is designed to detect when the test set is used to make predictions on the same data as the training set. This is a common problem in machine learning, and it can lead to a high accuracy on the training set, but a low accuracy on the test set.

    The check uses the 'train_dataset' parameter to specify the training dataset, and the 'test_dataset' parameter to specify the test dataset.

    The check returns a DataFrame that contains the details of the leakage overlap. This can be useful for debugging and understanding the performance of the model.
