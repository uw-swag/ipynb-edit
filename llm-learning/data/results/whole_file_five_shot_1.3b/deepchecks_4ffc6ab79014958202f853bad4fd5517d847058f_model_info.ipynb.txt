```python
    from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
    from deepchecks.checks.overview import ModelInfo

    clf = AdaBoostClassifier(learning_rate=1.2)
    ModelInfo().run(clf)
    ```
    This code is used to update the examples in the Deepchecks library. The `ModelInfo` class is used to display information about the model, including its parameters, metrics, and more.
