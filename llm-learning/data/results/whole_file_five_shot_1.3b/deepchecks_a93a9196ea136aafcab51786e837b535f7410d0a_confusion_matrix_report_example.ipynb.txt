    The code provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook, and it's used to perform a data science task using the DeepChecks library. DeepChecks is a library for building and validating machine learning checks. It provides a high-level interface for creating, running, and visualizing checks.

    The code is used to train an AdaBoost classifier on the Iris dataset, and then it uses DeepChecks to create a confusion matrix report for the classifier.

    However, the code provided is incomplete and does not perform the task described. It is missing the part where the DeepChecks check is run and the results are displayed.
