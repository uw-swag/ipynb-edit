    The code you provided is a Maven project configuration for a machine learning library, specifically the API and MXNet engine. The version of the library you're using is 0.8.0.

    The Maven project configuration is used to download and compile the necessary dependencies. The dependencies are:

    - ai.djl:api:0.8.0: This is the main library for Deep Java Library (DJL), a machine learning library for Java.
    - org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.26: This is the API for the SLF4J logging framework.
    - org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:1.7.26: This is a simple implementation of the SLF4J logging framework.
    - ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-engine:0.8.0: This is the MXNet engine, which is used to train and run machine learning models.
    - ai.djl.mxnet:mxnet-native-auto:1.7.0-backport: This is the native-optimized version of MXNet, which is used to train and run machine learning models.

    The code you've provided is a simple demonstration of how to use the Djl library to perform some mathematical operations. It includes functions for calculating risk and plotting the results.

    The last part of your code is a demonstration of how to use the MXNet engine to train a model. It creates a table of data, calculates risk, and plots the results.

    The code is written in Java, and it uses the Apache Commons Lang library for array manipulation.

    The version of the Djl library you're using is 0.8.0, and the MXNet version you're using is 1.7.0-backport.
