```python
    import pandas as pd

    # Load the data
    df = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_file.csv')

    # Perform data cleaning
    # This will depend on the specifics of your data and what you want to do with it
    # For example, you might want to drop rows with missing values, convert data types, etc.

    # Save the cleaned data
    df.to_csv('cleaned_data.csv', index=False)
    ```
    This is a placeholder for the actual data cleaning process. The specifics will depend on the data and the requirements of your project.
