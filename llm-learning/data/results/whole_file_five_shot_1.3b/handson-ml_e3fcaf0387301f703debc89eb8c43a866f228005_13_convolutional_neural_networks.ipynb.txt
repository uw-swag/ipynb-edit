# For example, we can fill missing values, normalize numerical features, etc.
df = df.fillna(df.mean())

# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv('processed_data.csv')

# Split the data into features and target
X = df.drop('target', axis=1)
y = df['target']

# Standardize the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Split the data into training and test sets

# Now you can use the 'X_train', 'y_train', 'X_test', and 'y_test' variables for your model
# For example, you can train a model on these data:

model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# And evaluate its performance:

accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print('Accuracy:', accuracy)

# You can also use the model to make predictions:

predictions = model.predict(X_test)
<\Cell_83>
<Cell_84>
# And visualize the results
