    The commit message "remove label_name from dataset constructor (#456)" is a change in the code. The label_name variable is no longer included in the dataset construction process. This is because the label_name is not a feature in the dataset, but a label that needs to be encoded. The code is already removing the label_name from the dataset, but it's still included in the cat_features list. If the label_name is not a feature, it should be removed from the cat_features list.

    Here is the updated code:
