    ## Restructuring the EDA Repo

    The EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) process is a crucial step in the data science pipeline. It involves a series of steps, from data exploration to data visualization, to model building.

    Here's a restructured version of the EDA process:

    1. **Data Understanding**: Start with a thorough understanding of the data. This includes understanding the structure, size, and quality of the data.

    2. **Data Cleaning**: Clean the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

    3. **Data Transformation**: Transform the data to make it suitable for analysis. This could involve encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical variables, or normalizing numerical variables.

    4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the patterns, trends, and correlations in the data. This could involve statistical analysis, visualization, and hypothesis testing.

    5. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features from existing ones to improve the model's performance. This could involve creating new variables, combining variables, or transforming variables.

    6. **Model Building**: Build a predictive model to predict the target variable. This could involve using different machine learning algorithms, or even a combination of algorithms.

    7. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics. This could involve accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or AUC-ROC.

    8. **Model Optimization**: Optimize the model for better performance. This could involve tuning hyperparameters, using ensemble methods, or using regularization techniques.

    9. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the model to a production environment. This could involve integrating the model into an existing system, or deploying the model as a web service.

    This process is iterative and requires continuous monitoring and updating as the data and business requirements change.

    The restructured EDA process is a step-by-step guide to the data science pipeline, and it's important to keep the process flexible and adaptable to the changing needs of the project.
