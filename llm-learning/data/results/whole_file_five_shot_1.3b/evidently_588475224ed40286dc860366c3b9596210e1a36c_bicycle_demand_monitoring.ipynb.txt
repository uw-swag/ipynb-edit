    The code you've provided is a series of operations that involve data analysis, machine learning, and visualization. Here's a brief explanation of what each section of code does:

    1. `import pandas as pd` and `import numpy as np`: These lines import the necessary libraries for data manipulation and numerical computations.

    2. `content = requests.get("https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/275/bike+sharing+dataset.zip").content`: This line downloads the dataset from a UCI Machine Learning Repository.

    3. `with zipfile.ZipFile(io.BytesIO(content)) as arc: raw_data = pd.read_csv(arc.open("hour.csv"), header=0, sep=',', parse_dates=['dteday'], index_col='dteday')`: This line reads the CSV file from the downloaded zip file and converts it into a pandas DataFrame.

    4. `raw_data.index = raw_data.apply(lambda row: datetime.combine(row.name, time(hour=int(row['hr']))), axis = 1)`: This line converts the 'dteday' column into a datetime index.

    5. `target = 'cnt'` and `prediction = 'prediction'`: These lines define the target variable and the prediction variable.

    6. `numerical_features = ['temp', 'atemp', 'hum', 'windspeed', 'hr', 'weekday']` and `categorical_features = ['season', 'holiday', 'workingday']`: These lines define the numerical and categorical features.

    7. `reference = raw_data.loc['2011-01-01 00:00:00':'2011-01-28 23:00:00']` and `current = raw_data.loc['2011-01-29 00:00:00':'2011-02-28 23:00:00']`: These lines create two subsets of the data for the reference and
