    The provided code is a script for building a machine learning project using Apache Spark and the Deep Java Library (DJL). The script is written in Jupyter notebook format and uses several Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

    The script is designed to train a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model on the FashionMNIST dataset, which is a dataset of Zalando's article images. The model is trained for 10 epochs with a learning rate of 0.5.

    The script also includes a function to perform dropout during the training process, which is used to prevent overfitting. The script also includes a function to calculate the accuracy of the model on the test set.

    The script also includes a function to render a line plot of the training and test loss over the epochs.

    However, the script is not complete and there are some missing parts. For example, the script does not include the code to load the data, which is required for the model to be trained. Also, the script does not include the code to save the trained model.

    The script also does not include the code to evaluate the model on the test set and save the evaluator metrics.

    The script also does not include the code to load the trained model and make predictions on new data.
