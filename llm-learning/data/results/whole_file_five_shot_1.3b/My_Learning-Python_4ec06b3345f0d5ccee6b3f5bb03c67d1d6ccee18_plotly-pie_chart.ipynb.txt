```python
    import plotly.graph_objects as go

    # Sample data
    labels = ['Apples', 'Bananas', 'Cherries', 'Dates', 'Elderberries']
    fruits = [10, 14, 12, 10, 10]

    # Create a pie chart
    fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Pie(labels=labels, values=fruits)])

    # Plot the chart and save it to an image file
    fig.write_image("pie_chart.png")
    ```
    This code will create a pie chart with the given data and save it as a PNG image file named "pie_chart.png".
