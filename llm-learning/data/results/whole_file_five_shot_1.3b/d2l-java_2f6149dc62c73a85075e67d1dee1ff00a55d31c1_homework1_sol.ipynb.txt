    It seems like you're trying to use the Deep Java Library (DJL) to perform matrix operations on GPUs. However, the code you've provided is incomplete and doesn't seem to be a complete project. 

    DJL is a machine learning library that provides a high-level API for building and training machine learning models. It supports a wide range of machine learning models, including neural networks, transformers, and more.

    The code you've provided is a simple example of how to use DJL to perform matrix operations. It uses the MXNet engine, which is a high-performance engine for deep learning.

    However, the code you've provided is incomplete and doesn't seem to be a complete project. It's missing the necessary imports for the DJL library, the necessary dependencies for the DJL library, and the necessary code to perform matrix operations.

    If you're looking to use DJL to perform matrix operations, you'll need to complete the code as per the DJL library's documentation and requirements.

    If you're looking to use DJL to perform GPU-accelerated matrix operations, you'll need to use the MXNet engine. The code you've provided is for CPU-accelerated operations.

    If you're looking to use DJL to perform other machine learning tasks, you'll need to complete the code as per the DJL library's documentation and requirements.

    If you're looking to use DJL to perform other tasks, you'll need to complete the code as per the DJL library's documentation and requirements.
