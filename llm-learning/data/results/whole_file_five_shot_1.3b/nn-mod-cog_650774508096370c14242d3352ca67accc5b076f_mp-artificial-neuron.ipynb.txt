    The perceptron is a basic artificial neural network model that is used for binary classification problems. It is a type of feedforward artificial neural network. The limitations of the perceptron model are:

    1. It is a linear model, which means it can only learn from data that is linearly separable.
    2. It is not capable of handling complex patterns or non-linear data.
    3. It is not suitable for large datasets.

    Conclusions:
    The perceptron model is a simple and effective tool for learning from data, but it is not suitable for large datasets or complex patterns. For these reasons, other types of neural networks, such as the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) or convolutional neural networks (CNN), are often used.
