The code you provided is a set of commands for Maven to install the necessary dependencies for a machine learning project. The dependencies are for the AI Deep Learning library DJL. The code also includes a function to create a VGG-like network architecture, a function to train a model, and a function to render a plot of the training process.

The commit message "Fix google net (#20)" suggests that the code is related to a machine learning project, and the issue number is 20. The code is for a specific machine learning library, DJL, and it's related to a specific issue.

The code also includes a function to reduce the number of channels in a convolutional layer, which is a common practice in deep learning to reduce the number of parameters in the model.

The code also includes a function to train a model with a reduced number of channels in a convolutional layer, and it's related to a specific issue.

The code also includes a function to render a plot of the training process, which is a common practice in machine learning to visualize the training process.
