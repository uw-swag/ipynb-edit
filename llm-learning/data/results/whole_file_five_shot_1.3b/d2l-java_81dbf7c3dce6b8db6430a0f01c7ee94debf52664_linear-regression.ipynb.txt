    The code you provided seems to be a set of Maven commands to download and configure dependencies for a project. However, it doesn't seem to contain any code or instructions to be executed. 

    The code is mostly for building and managing Maven projects. It downloads specific versions of libraries (like ai.djl, tech.tablesaw, etc.) and configures them for your project.

    If you want to execute the code, you would need to run it in a Jupyter notebook or a similar environment where you can execute code. 

    If you're looking to run the code, you would need to copy and paste it into a Jupyter notebook cell, then press the "run" button or use the shortcut `Shift + Enter`.

    If you're looking to understand the code, you can use the `%%javascript` magic command to run JavaScript code in a Jupyter notebook. For example, you can use the `%%javascript` magic command to run the following JavaScript code:

    ```javascript
    function normal(z, mu, sigma) {
        var dist = new Array(z.length);
        for (var i = 0; i < z.length; i++) {
            var p = 1.0 / (Math.sqrt(2 * Math.PI * sigma * sigma));
            dist[i] = p * Math.pow(Math.E, -0.5 / (sigma * sigma) * (z[i] - mu) * (z[i] - mu));
        }
        return dist;
    }
    ```

    This JavaScript function calculates the normal distribution for a given array of values.

    If you're looking to understand the code, you can use the `%%python` magic command to run Python code in a Jupyter notebook. For example, you can use the `%%python` magic command to run the following Python code:

    ```python
    import ai.djl.ndarray as nd
    import ai.djl.ndarray.types as ndt
    import ai.djl.ndarray.index as ndi

    n = 10000
    manager = nd.NDManager.newBase
