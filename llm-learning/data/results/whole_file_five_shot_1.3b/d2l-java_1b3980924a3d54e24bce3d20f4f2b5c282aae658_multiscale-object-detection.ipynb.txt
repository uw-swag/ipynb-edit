```java
    // Uncomment the following function call to display image
    // displayAnchors(img4, 1, 1, Arrays.asList(0.8f));       
    ```

    The function `displayAnchors` is used to display the anchor boxes generated by the `MultiBoxPrior` class. The anchor boxes are generated based on the input image and the specified sizes and ratios. The anchor boxes are then drawn on the input image using the `ImageUtils.drawBBoxes` method. The image is then displayed using the `ImageUtils.showImage` method.

    The commented out lines of code are used to display the anchor boxes for different input sizes and ratios. For example, `displayAnchors(img4, 1, 1, Arrays.asList(0.8f));` will display the anchor boxes for an input image of size 1x1 and a ratio of 0.8.

    Please note that the `displayAnchors` function is a part of a larger class, and the `ImageUtils.drawBBoxes` and `ImageUtils.showImage` methods are not part of the D2L's djl-imports package. You may need to import these methods from the d2l-en package or another package that contains these methods.

    Also, the `ImageUtils.drawBBoxes` method is not a public API and may not be available in the latest versions of the d2l-en package. If you are using a version of the d2l-en package that does not include this method, you may need to implement it yourself.

    Finally, the `ImageUtils.showImage` method is not a public API and may not be available in the latest versions of the d2l-en package. If you are using a version of the d2l-en package that does not include this method, you may need to implement it yourself.
