    The code you provided is a set of Jupyter notebook cells that define and run a machine learning pipeline using the Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP) framework. 

    The pipeline includes three components:

    1. `create_dataset`: This component reads data from a BigQuery table and writes the data to a CSV file in Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
    2. `train_model`: This component trains a decision tree model on the data. The trained model is then saved to a file in GCS.
    3. `deploy_model`: This component deploys the trained model to an AI Platform model.

    The pipeline parameters are defined in a dictionary, and the pipeline is run with these parameters. The pipeline parameters are used to specify the input and output data for each component.

    The pipeline is defined in a separate Python file, and the pipeline is run using the `AutoMLOps.go` function. This function is used to run the pipeline, and it takes the pipeline parameters and the project ID as arguments.
