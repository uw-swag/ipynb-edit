    The function `train2d()` in the code snippet you provided is a method for training a 2D function. The method takes a `trainer` function and the number of training steps as input, and returns a list of weights. The weights are updated in each iteration of the training process.

    The `showTrace2d()` function is used to display the trace of the 2D variables during the training process.

    The `newton()` function is a modification of the gradient descent method, which is used to minimize a 2D function. The method returns the final values of the variables and the trace of the variables.

    The code snippet you provided is a part of a larger code snippet, and it's not clear what the purpose of the code is. It seems to be a demonstration of how to use the `train2d()`, `showTrace2d()`, and `newton()` methods in a Java program.

    However, the code snippet you provided is not complete and does not contain the complete implementation of the `train2d()`, `showTrace2d()`, and `newton()` methods.

    Please provide more details or context so I can provide a more accurate response.
