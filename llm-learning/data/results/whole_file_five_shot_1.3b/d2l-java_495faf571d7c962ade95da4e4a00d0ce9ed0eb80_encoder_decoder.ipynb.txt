    # Section 9.6: Encoder-Decoder Architecture (#104)
    # This section describes the Encoder-Decoder architecture, which is a type of neural network used in natural language processing.
    # The Encoder-Decoder architecture is a type of sequence-to-sequence model, where the input is a sequence of words and the output is a sequence of words.
    # The Encoder part of the architecture is responsible for encoding the input sequence, and the Decoder part is responsible for decoding the output sequence.
    # The Encoder-Decoder architecture is used in various tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and more.
