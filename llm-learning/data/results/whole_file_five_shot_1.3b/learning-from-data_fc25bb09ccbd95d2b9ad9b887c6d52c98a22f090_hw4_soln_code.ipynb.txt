    # Homework 3 solution
    # -------------------

    # 1. Write a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list that contains only the even numbers from the original list.

    def get_even_numbers(numbers):
        return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]

    # 2. Write a Python function that takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list that contains only the strings that are longer than 5 characters.

    def get_long_strings(strings):
        return [string for string in strings if len(string) > 5]

    # 3. Write a Python function that takes a list of tuples as input and returns a new list that contains only the second element of each tuple.

    def get_second_elements(tuples):
        return [t[1] for t in tuples]

    # 4. Write a Python function that takes a list of dictionaries as input and returns a new list that contains only the dictionaries that have a 'age' key with a value greater than 25.

    def get_older_people(people):
        return [person for person in people if 'age' in person and person['age'] > 25]

    # 5. Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list that contains only the numbers that are divisible by 3 and 5.

    def get_divisible_numbers(numbers):
        return [num for num in numbers if num % 3 == 0 and num % 5 == 0]

    # 6. Write a Python function that takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list that contains only the strings that are palindromes.

    def get_palindromes(strings):
        return [string for string in strings if string == string[::-1]]

    # 7. Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list that contains only the numbers that are prime.

    def get_prime_numbers(numbers):
        return [num for num in numbers if num > 1 and all(num % i for i in
