The code cells in the provided example are related to data preprocessing, model training, and calibration check. Here's a brief explanation of what each part of the code does:

1. The code imports necessary libraries and modules.

2. The `custom_formatwarning` function is defined to ignore all warnings except the message.

3. The `urlopen` function is used to download a dataset from a URL.

4. The `LabelEncoder` class is used to encode categorical features.

5. The `Pipeline` class is used to preprocess the data.

6. The `RandomForestClassifier` model is trained on the preprocessed data.

7. The `CalibrationScore` check is run on the test data to evaluate the calibration of the model.

8. The code then loads the iris dataset and trains a logistic regression model.

9. The `CalibrationScore` check is run on the test data to evaluate the calibration of the logistic regression model.

Please note that the code is written in a Jupyter notebook format and uses the Deepchecks library for calibration checks.
