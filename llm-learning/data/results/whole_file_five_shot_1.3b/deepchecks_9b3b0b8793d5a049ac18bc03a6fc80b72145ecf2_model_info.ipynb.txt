```python
    from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
    from deepchecks.checks.overview import ModelInfo

    clf = AdaBoostClassifier(learning_rate=1.2)
    ModelInfo().run(clf)
    ```

    This code is used to update the model information in the DeepChecks library. The `ModelInfo` class is used to generate a report about the model's performance.
