    The code you provided is a part of a deep learning project. It includes importing necessary libraries, defining classes, and functions for a sequence-to-sequence model. The code also includes a function to train a sequence-to-sequence model, a function to predict a sequence, and a function to compute the BLEU score.

    However, the code you provided is not complete. It seems like you're trying to implement a sequence-to-sequence model using a deep learning library like DJL. The code you provided is incomplete and does not include the complete implementation of the sequence-to-sequence model.

    If you want to implement a sequence-to-sequence model using a deep learning library like DJL, you should follow the steps provided in the code you provided.

    If you have any specific questions or need further help, feel free to ask.
