The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook, and it's updating the examples in a DeepChecks check. The examples are updated to reflect the changes in the code.

The DeepChecks library is a Python library for data-driven machine learning. It provides a high-level interface for building, analyzing, and visualizing machine learning pipelines.

The code in the notebook is used to train a Gradient Boosting Regressor model on a diabetes dataset. The model is then used to run a check on the test dataset, which is used to evaluate the performance of the model.

The check is a regression error distribution check, which is used to evaluate the error distribution in the model's predictions. The error distribution is a measure of the model's performance, and it's used to identify any potential issues with the model.

The code in the notebook is updating the examples in the DeepChecks library. The examples are updated to reflect the changes in the code.
