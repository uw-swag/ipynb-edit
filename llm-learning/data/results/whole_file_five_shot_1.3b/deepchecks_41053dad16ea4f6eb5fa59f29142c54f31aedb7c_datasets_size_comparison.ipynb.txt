    The code you provided is a part of a DeepChecks check, which is a library for data quality checks in machine learning. The check is designed to ensure that the size of the training dataset is not smaller than the size of the test dataset, and that the ratio of the size of the test dataset to the size of the training dataset is not smaller than a certain threshold.

    The code is divided into three parts:

    1. Importing necessary libraries and creating a random DataFrame.
    2. Splitting the DataFrame into a training set and a test set.
    3. Creating a DeepChecks Dataset object for both the training and test sets.
    4. Defining a check instance.
    5. Running the check on the datasets.
    6. Checking the conditions that were met.
    7. Printing whether all conditions were met.

    The check instance is defined with the conditions that the size of the test dataset should be smaller than the size of the training dataset, and the ratio of the size of the test dataset to the size of the training dataset should be smaller than 0.2.

    The `run` method of the check instance is used to run the check on the datasets, and the `conditions_decision` method is used to get the decision for each condition.

    The `all` function is used to check if all conditions are met. If all conditions are met, the `all` function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

    The `is_pass` attribute of the `ConditionResult` objects is used to check if the condition was met. If a condition was not met, the `is_pass` attribute is `False`.

    The `print` statement at the end checks if all conditions were met, and if they were, it prints "Datasets passed conditions", otherwise it prints "Datasets did not pass conditions".
