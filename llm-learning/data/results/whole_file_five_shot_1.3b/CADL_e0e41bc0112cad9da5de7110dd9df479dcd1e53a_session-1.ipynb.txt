    This notebook contains the implementation of a number of image processing tasks, including loading, resizing, and normalizing images, applying Gabor filters, and convolving images. The notebook also demonstrates how to use TensorFlow to perform operations on the images, such as calculating the mean and standard deviation, and sorting the images. The final part of the notebook creates a submission for the session-1 of the course.

    The notebook is designed to be run in a Jupyter notebook environment, and it uses the Python programming language. The libraries used in the notebook include NumPy for numerical computations, Matplotlib for plotting, Scikit-image for image processing, and TensorFlow for machine learning.

    The notebook also includes a section for checking the Python version and installing necessary libraries, as well as loading and preprocessing images. The notebook then demonstrates how to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the images, and how to apply a Gabor filter to each image. The notebook also demonstrates how to convolve the images and normalize them, and how to sort the images. Finally, the notebook creates a submission for the session-1 of the course.
