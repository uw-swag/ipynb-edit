    The code provided is a DeepChecks example for comparing two columns of a DataFrame and finding any mismatches. The mismatches are highlighted in red.

    The code is written in Python and uses the DeepChecks library, which is a library for data inspection and validation.

    The DeepChecks library provides a variety of checks for comparing two dataframes, such as:
    - StringMismatchComparison: Compares two columns and highlights any mismatches in the text.
    - NumericMismatchComparison: Compares two columns and highlights any mismatches in the numeric values.
    - DateMismatchComparison: Compares two columns and highlights any mismatches in the date values.

    The code provided is a simple example and may not cover all the features of the DeepChecks library.

    Please note that the code provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook and it may not work as expected if run outside of a Jupyter notebook environment.

    The DeepChecks library is not available in a standard Python environment. You may need to install it using pip:

    ```
    pip install deepchecks
    ```

    After installing the DeepChecks library, you can run the code provided in a Jupyter notebook.
