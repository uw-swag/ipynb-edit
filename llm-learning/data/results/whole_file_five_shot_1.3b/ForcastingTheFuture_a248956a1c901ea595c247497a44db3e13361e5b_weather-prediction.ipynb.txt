    ## Code: Adding comments to the code

    ## This code is used for data analysis and visualization.
    ## It includes loading data from a CSV file, handling nil values,
    ## creating a correlation matrix, and filling missing values in a column.
    ## The 'TargetMaxTemp' column is created by filling the missing values
    ## in the 'MaxTemp' column with the value from the next row.
    ## The final dataframe is then saved to a new CSV file.

    ## The code is also commented to make it easier to understand.
