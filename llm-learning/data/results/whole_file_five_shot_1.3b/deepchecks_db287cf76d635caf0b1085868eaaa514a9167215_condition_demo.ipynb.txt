    ## How to update demo notebooks for How-to-Guides (#237)

To update the demo notebooks for a How-to-Guides guide, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the current state of the notebook**: The first step is to understand the current state of the notebook. You can do this by running the cell that contains the `suite` object.

2. **Update the notebook**: After identifying the current state, you can update the notebook by modifying the code in the cells that are relevant to the guide. This could include modifying the data, the conditions, or the suite itself.

3. **Test the notebook**: After updating the notebook, you should test it to make sure it works as expected. This can be done by running the cells that contain the `result` object.

4. **Review the notebook**: Finally, review the notebook to make sure it is clear and easy to understand.

Remember, the goal of the notebook is to provide a clear and concise guide to the reader on how to perform a specific task or check a dataset. The notebook should be updated as necessary to reflect the changes you make.
