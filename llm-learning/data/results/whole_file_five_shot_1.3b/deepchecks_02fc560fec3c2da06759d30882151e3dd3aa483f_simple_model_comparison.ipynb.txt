The code cells you provided are related to the use of the AdaBoostClassifier from the sklearn library in Python, and the use of deepchecks library for model comparison. Here are some of the changes I made:

1. I added a seed for the random number generator to ensure reproducibility.
2. I loaded the iris dataset from sklearn and split it into training and testing sets.
3. I created a Dataset object for both the training and testing datasets.
4. I created an AdaBoostClassifier and trained it on the training data.
5. I created a SimpleModelComparison check and run it on the training and testing datasets. This check compares the performance of the model with a simple model type (random, constant, or a tree with a gain not less than 0.2).

Please let me know if you need further assistance or if there's a specific part of the code you'd like to be updated.
