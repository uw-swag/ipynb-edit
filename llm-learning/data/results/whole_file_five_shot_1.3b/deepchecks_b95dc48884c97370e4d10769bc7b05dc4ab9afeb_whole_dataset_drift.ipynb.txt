The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook. The commit message "remove label_name from dataset constructor (#456)" suggests that the label_name variable is being removed from the dataset constructor. This is a common practice in machine learning to avoid confusion and to ensure that the label is not included in the dataset.

However, the code you provided is not complete and does not include the entire process of removing the label_name from the dataset. It only includes the part of the code that reads the dataset and encodes the label.

Here is the complete code:

```python
import pandas as pd
from urllib.request import urlopen
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
import numpy as np

name_data = urlopen('http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.names')
lines = [l.decode("utf-8") for l in name_data if ':' in l.decode("utf-8") and '|' not in l.decode("utf-8")]

features = [l.split(':')[0] for l in lines]
label_name = 'income'

cat_features = [l.split(':')[0] for l in lines if 'continuous' not in l]

train_df = pd.read_csv('http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data',
                       names=features + [label_name])
test_df = pd.read_csv('http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.test',
                      names=features + [label_name], skiprows=1)

test_df[label_name] = test_df [label_name].str[:-1]

encoder = LabelEncoder()
encoder.fit(train_df[label_name])
train_df[label_name] = encoder.transform(train_df[label_name])
test_df[label_name] = encoder.transform(test_df[label_name])
```

This code reads the dataset, enc
