    The code has been split into several notebooks for better organization and readability. 

    The first notebook, "Basics of Python and Numpy", covers the basics of Python programming, numpy library, and data segmentation.

    The second notebook, "Spectral features and kNN", splits the code into two parts, one for spectral features and kNN, and the other for the rest of the code.

    The third notebook, "Removing one level of headers", removes the headers from the code.

    The remaining notebooks, starting from "Initial commit: basics of python, numpy, segmentation" to "Spectral features and kNN", cover the rest of the code.

    Each notebook is designed to be self-contained and focuses on a specific aspect of Python programming, numpy, and data segmentation.

    The last notebook, "jupyter kasteren working", is a Jupyter notebook that uses the kASTEREN dataset for text classification and folder renaming.

    The code in each notebook is well-organized and commented to make it easy to understand.
