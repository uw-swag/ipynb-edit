    The code you provided is a demonstration of how to use the DeepChecks library to perform label drift checks. The library is used to detect if the labels in the training and test datasets are drifting.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    1. The code first imports the necessary libraries and modules.
    2. It then generates random data for training and testing.
    3. The data is then converted into pandas DataFrames and passed to the DeepChecks Dataset class for creating datasets.
    4. The TrainTestLabelDrift class is used to perform the label drift check.
    5. The check is run on the training and test datasets.
    6. The code then demonstrates how to add a condition to the check to only pass if the drift score is not greater than a certain value.

    The output of the check will provide information about the drift in the labels, such as the drift score and the number of instances where the drift score is greater than the threshold.

    Please note that the DeepChecks library is a powerful tool for data quality checks, but it requires a good understanding of machine learning and data science concepts.
