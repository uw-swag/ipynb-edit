    The issue seems to be with the convergence of the model. The model is not converging as expected. The model is not learning from the data.

    The issue could be due to the nature of the data or the model architecture. The model might not be able to learn from the data.

    To fix this issue, you might need to adjust the learning rate, the number of layers, the number of units in each layer, or the type of layers used.

    Also, you might need to use a different optimizer or loss function.

    Please check the logs and adjust the parameters accordingly.
