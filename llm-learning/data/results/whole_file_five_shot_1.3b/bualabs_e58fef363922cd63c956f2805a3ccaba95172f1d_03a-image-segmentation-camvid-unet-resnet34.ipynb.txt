    This notebook is designed to demonstrate the application of association rule mining in the context of image segmentation. The notebook uses the FastAI library, which is a high-level API for fastai/vision, a collection of data science and machine learning libraries. The notebook also uses the U-Net architecture for image segmentation, which is a type of convolutional neural network for biomedical image segmentation. The notebook also demonstrates how to use the OneHotTransactions class from the fastai library to preprocess the transaction data for association rule mining. The notebook also demonstrates how to use the apriori function from the fastai library to find frequent itemsets in the transaction data. The notebook also demonstrates how to use the accuracy function from the fastai library to evaluate the performance of the U-Net model. The notebook also demonstrates how to use the fit_one_cycle function from the fastai library to train the U-Net model.
