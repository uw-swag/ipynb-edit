    The commit message "Rename test presets (#402)" suggests that the test presets are being renamed. This could be a change in the way the tests are organized in the code, or it could be a change in the naming convention of the test presets.

    The original code cells are not shown in the response, but the changes made to the test presets are reflected in the commit message.

    The test presets used in the code are:

    1. DataStability
    2. DataQuality
    3. DataDrift
    4. NoTargetPerformance
    5. Regression
    6. MulticlassClassification
    7. BinaryClassification
    8. BinaryClassificationTopK

    Each of these tests has been used to evaluate the performance of a model on a dataset. The tests are run on two datasets: a reference dataset and a current dataset. The results of these tests are then used to evaluate the performance of the model on the current dataset.

    The test presets are used in the `TestSuite` class, which is used to run a suite of tests on a set of data. The `run` method of the `TestSuite` class is used to run the tests on the data, and the results of these tests are then used to evaluate the performance of the model on the data.
