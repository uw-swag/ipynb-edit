    ## Example 1: Random Board

    The `random_board` function creates a random board of size `n`. The function uses the `numpy.random.randint` function to generate a random integer for each row of the board.

    Here is an example of how to use the `random_board` function:

    ```python
    board = random_board(4)
    print(board)
    ```

    ## Example 2: Conflicts

    The `conflicts` function calculates the number of conflicts in a given board. A conflict is defined as the number of queens that can attack each other.

    Here is an example of how to use the `conflicts` function:

    ```python
    board = [1, 3, 0, 2]
    print(conflicts(board))
    ```

    ## Example 3: Show Board

    The `show_board` function displays a board. The board is represented as a 2D array where each element at position `(i, j)` is 1 if the queen at row `i` and column `j` is in the position `(i, j)`, and 0 otherwise.

    Here is an example of how to use the `show_board` function:

    ```python
    board = [1, 3, 0, 2]
    show_board(board)
    ```
    ```
    ## Example 4: Random Board

    The `random_board` function creates a random board of size `n`. The function uses the `numpy.random.randint` function to generate a random integer for each row of the board.

    Here is an example of how to use the `random_board` function:

    ```python
    board = random_board(4)
    print(board)
    ```

    ## Example 5: Conflicts

    The `conflicts` function calculates the number of conflicts in a given board. A conflict is defined as the number of queens that can attack each other.

    Here is an example of how to use the `conflicts` function:

    ```python
