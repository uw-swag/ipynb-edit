    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that uses the Event Store OLTP and SQL APIs to interact with an Event Store database. The notebook is set up to connect to a specific host and port, load a specific table from the database, and perform various operations on the data.

    However, the code is not complete and it seems to be missing some parts. For example, it's missing the part where the notebook is set up to connect to the IBM Cloud.

    Here's a complete version of the code, including the setup for the IBM Cloud:

```python
<Cell_0>
# Set your host IP address
HOST = "XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX"

# Port will be 1100 for version 1.1.2 or later (5555 for version 1.1.1)
PORT = "1100"

# Database name
DB_NAME = "TESTDB"

# Table name
TABLE_NAME = "IOT_TEMPERATURE"

# Set up the IBM Cloud connection
