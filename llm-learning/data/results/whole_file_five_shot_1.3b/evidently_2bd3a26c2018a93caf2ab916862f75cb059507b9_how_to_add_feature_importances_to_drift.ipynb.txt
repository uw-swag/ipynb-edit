```python
    from sklearn.inspection import permutation_importance

    # Define the model
    model = load_model('model.h5')

    # Generate some data
    X, y = generate_data()

    # Fit the model
    model.fit(X, y)

    # Generate some new data
    X_new, _ = generate_data()

    # Use permutation importance to detect data drift
    result = permutation_importance(model, X_new, y, n_repeats=10, random_state=42, n_jobs=2)
    importances = result.importances_mean

    # Print feature importances
    for i, name in enumerate(X.columns):
        print(f"{name}: {importances[i]}")
    ```

    This script uses permutation importance to detect data drift in a model. The permutation importance of a feature is calculated as the mean decrease in model performance when the feature is randomly shuffled. The higher the permutation importance, the more likely the feature is a good predictor of the target variable.

    Note: This is a simplified example and in a real-world scenario, you would need to handle more complex scenarios such as handling missing values, outliers, and more.
