    In the above YAML file, a GitHub action is set up to run whenever there is a push to the master branch. The action checks out the code, sets up Python, installs the dependencies, and then runs the `links_check.py` script.

    The `links_check.py` script is a simple Python script that checks the links in the README file. If there are any broken links, it will print an error message.

    Please replace `links_check.py` with your actual script.

    The `requirements.txt` file should contain the list of Python dependencies your script requires.

    The `links_check.py` script should be written to check the links in the README file. If there are any broken links, it should print an error message.

    The `links_check.py` script can be written in any language that can be run from the command line.

    The `links_check.py` script should be able to handle the following cases:

    - It should be able to check the links in the README file.
    - It should be able to handle the case where the links are relative paths.
    - It should be able to handle the case where the links are absolute paths.
    - It should be able to handle the case where the links are URLs.
    - It should be able to handle the case where the links are images.
    - It should be able to handle the case where the links are videos.
    - It should be able to handle the case where the links are spreadshe
