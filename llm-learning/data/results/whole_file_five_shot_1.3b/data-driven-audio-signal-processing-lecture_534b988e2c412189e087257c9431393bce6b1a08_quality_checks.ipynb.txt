    The code above is a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the segmentation of signals in Python using the scipy and matplotlib libraries. The notebook begins by importing necessary libraries and defining a path to a dataset. It then reads all .wav files in the dataset, normalizes the signals, and plots the magnitude spectrum, spectrogram, and histogram of the signals. The notebook also calculates and plots the mean and variance of the signals.

    The signals are segmented into different parts based on their frequency content. The magnitude spectrum of a signal shows the amplitude of the signal at different frequencies. The spectrogram shows the power spectral density of a signal at different frequencies. The histogram of a signal shows the frequency content of the signal. The mean and variance of the signals are calculated and plotted.

    The notebook ends with a plot of the mean and variance of the signals over the different examples. This plot can be used to compare the performance of different signal segmentation algorithms.

    The notebook also includes a plot of the mean and variance of the signals over the different examples. This plot can be used to compare the performance of different signal segmentation algorithms.
