    The code you provided is a simple example of using the DeepChecks library to perform a ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) report on a logistic regression model. 

    Here's a breakdown of the code:

    - The first part of the code imports the necessary libraries and functions.
    - The `custom_formatwarning` function is a custom formatting function for warnings. It ignores all warnings except the message.
    - The `warnings.formatwarning` is set to use our custom function.
    - The `load_iris` function is used to load the iris dataset.
    - A logistic regression model is created and trained on the iris dataset.
    - The iris dataset is split into a training set and a test set.
    - The training set is used to train the logistic regression model.
    - The test set is used to evaluate the model.
    - The `Dataset` class is used to create a dataset from the test set and the features of the iris dataset.
    - The `RocReport` class is used to create a ROC report.
    - The `run` method of the `RocReport` class is used to run the report on the dataset and the logistic regression model.

    The ROC report will provide a detailed report of the model's performance, including the false positive rate, true positive rate, and the area under the ROC curve.

    Please note that the DeepChecks library is a powerful tool for data analysis and model evaluation, but it requires a good understanding of machine learning and data science concepts.
