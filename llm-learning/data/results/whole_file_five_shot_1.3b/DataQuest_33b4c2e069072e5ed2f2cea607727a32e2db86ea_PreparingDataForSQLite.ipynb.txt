    The code you provided is a series of operations performed on a dataset, which includes reading a CSV file, checking for unnamed columns, filtering data, and finally, storing the data in a SQLite database.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    1. The first part of the code imports the necessary libraries and loads the dataset.

    2. The second part of the code prints the number of rows and columns in the dataset.

    3. The third part of the code checks for unnamed columns and prints the count of each column.

    4. The fourth part of the code adds a new column 'Year' to the dataset, and filters out the rows where the year is later than 2000.

    5. The fifth part of the code converts the 'Won' column to a binary format, and drops the 'Won?' column.

    6. The sixth part of the code splits the 'Additional Info' column into two new columns 'Movie' and 'Character'.

    7. The seventh part of the code stores the final dataset in a SQLite database.

    8. The eighth part of the code prints the table information of the 'nominations' table in the SQLite database.

    9. The ninth part of the code selects the first 10 rows of the 'nominations' table from the SQLite database.

    10. The tenth part of the code closes the database connection.

    The code is designed to be a part of a larger data processing pipeline, and it's a good example of how to use pandas, SQLite, and SQL commands to manipulate and analyze data.
