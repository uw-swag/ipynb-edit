    The feature "Fare" has been added to the dataset. This feature is a measure of the ticket fare or the cost of the ticket. The data set includes the "Fare" feature which is a continuous variable.

    The code snippet for adding the "Fare" feature to the dataset is as follows:

    ```python
    #Introducing dummies for Fare
    fare_dummy = pd.get_dummies(train_DF['Fare'])
    train_DF = train_DF.join(fare_dummy)
    fare_dummy_test = pd.get_dummies(test_DF['Fare'])
    test_DF = test_DF.join(fare_dummy_test)

    train_DF.drop(['Fare'], axis = 1, inplace = True)
    test_DF.drop(['Fare'], axis = 1, inplace = True)
    ```

    This code introduces dummy variables for the "Fare" feature, which is a categorical variable. The dummy variables are created by binning the "Fare" feature into different categories. The "Fare" feature is then dropped from the original data sets.

    Please note that the "Fare" feature is not a feature of the dataset that is being used for training the model, it's a feature of the test set that the model is supposed to predict.
