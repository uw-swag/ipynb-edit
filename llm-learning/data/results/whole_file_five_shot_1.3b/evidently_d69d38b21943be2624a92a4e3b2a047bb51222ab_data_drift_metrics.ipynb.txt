    The commit message "Rename test presets (#402)" is a rename of a test preset. The test preset is a set of tests that are used to analyze the performance of a model. The test preset "NoTargetPerformance" is renamed to "NoTargetPerformance_v2".

    The original code cells are:

    - Cell_0: Importing necessary libraries.
    - Cell_1: Loading the "adult" dataset and preparing the target and prediction columns.
    - Cell_2: Running a ColumnDriftMetric test on the current and reference datasets.
    - Cell_3: Exporting the report as a JSON.
    - Cell_4: Running a ColumnDriftMetric test on the current and reference datasets with a different column.
    - Cell_5: Running a DataDriftTable test on the current and reference datasets.
    - Cell_6: Running a DatasetDriftMetric test on the current and reference datasets.
    - Cell_7: Running a DatasetDriftMetric test on the current and reference datasets with a specific threshold.
    - Cell_8: Running a NoTargetPerformance test on the current and reference datasets.
    - Cell_9: Exporting the report as a JSON.
    - Cell_10: Running a NoTargetPerformance test on the current and reference datasets with a specific set of important features.
    - Cell_11: Exporting the report as a JSON.

    The new test preset is "NoTargetPerformance_v2".
