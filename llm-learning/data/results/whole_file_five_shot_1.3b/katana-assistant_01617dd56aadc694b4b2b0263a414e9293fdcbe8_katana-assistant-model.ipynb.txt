    # Keras model comments

    # The Keras model is a type of deep learning model that is used for image classification tasks.
    # It consists of a sequence of layers, where each layer is a node in the network.
    # The Sequential model is a linear stack of layers that you can use to build a neural network.
    # The Dense layer is a fully connected layer in the neural network. It is equivalent to the dot product of the weights and the input.
    # The Dropout layer is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction rate of input units to 0 at each update during training time, which helps prevent overfitting.
    # The SGD optimizer is a type of gradient descent optimization algorithm. It is used to update the weights of the neural network.
    # The model's loss function is the difference between the network's predictions and the actual values.
    # The model's accuracy metric is the percentage of correct predictions made by the model.
    # The model is trained using the training data, and then it's tested on the test data.
    # The model's performance is evaluated using the test data.
    # The model's performance is then evaluated using the test data.
    # The model's performance is then evaluated using the test data.
    # The model's performance is then evaluated using the test data.
