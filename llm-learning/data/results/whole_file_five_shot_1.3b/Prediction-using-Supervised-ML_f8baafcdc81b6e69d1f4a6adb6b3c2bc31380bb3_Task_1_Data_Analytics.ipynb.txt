    ### Response:
    Here is an example of how to add a new file to a folder in Google Cloud Storage.

    ```python
    from google.cloud import storage

    def upload_blob(bucket_name, source_file_name, destination_blob_name):
        """Uploads a file to the bucket."""
        # bucket_name = "your-bucket-name"
        # source_file_name = "local/path/to/file"
        # destination_blob_name = "storage-object-name"

        storage_client = storage.Client()
        bucket = storage_client.bucket(bucket_name)
        blob = bucket.blob(destination_blob_name)

        blob.upload_from_filename(source_file_name)

        print(
            "File {} uploaded to {}.".format(
                source_file_name, destination_blob_name
            )
        )

    def add_file_to_folder(bucket_name, source_file_name, destination_folder_name, destination_blob_name):
        """Uploads a file to the specified folder in the bucket."""
