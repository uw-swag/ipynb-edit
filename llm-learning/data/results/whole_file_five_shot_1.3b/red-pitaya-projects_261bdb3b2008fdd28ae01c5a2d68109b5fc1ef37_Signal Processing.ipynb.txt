The code cells you provided are related to audio recording and processing in Python. Here's a brief explanation of what each code cell does:

1. `<Cell_0>`: This cell is using the `redpitaya.overlay.mercury` module to connect to the FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) overlay of the Red Pitaya FPGA. It then sets up the audio input and triggers it.

2. `<Cell_1>`: This cell starts the audio recording by calling the `start()` method on the `in2` object.

3. `<Cell_2>`: This cell plays the recorded audio data. It uses the `IPython.display` module to play the audio data.

4. `<Cell_3>`: This cell plots the audio data. It uses matplotlib to plot the audio data as a time-domain signal.

5. `<Cell_4>`: This cell computes the Fourier Transform (FFT) of the audio data and plots the spectrum. It also removes the DC bias and plots the spectrum.

The code cells are part of a larger project that involves audio processing and data analysis. The project involves using an FPGA to record audio data, processing the data, and then analyzing the results.
