```
    The code you provided is a set of examples for Deepchecks, a Python library for data quality checks.

    Here's a brief explanation of the code:

    - The first two cells import the necessary libraries and create some test data.

    - The `NewLabelTrainTest` class is a custom Deepchecks check that trains a model on a dataset and then validates it on another dataset.

    - The `run` method of the `NewLabelTrainTest` class is used to run the check on the test and validation datasets.

    - The next two cells create more complex datasets with additional features.

    - The `NewLabelTrainTest` class is then run on these new datasets.

    Please note that the `NewLabelTrainTest` class is a custom Deepchecks check and it's not included in the standard Deepchecks library. You might need to install it using pip or conda.

    Also, please note that the Deepchecks library is still in its early stages and some features may not be available or may behave differently than they do in the standard Deepchecks library.

    If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to ask.
