```
    The code you provided is a part of a Jupyter notebook and it's not clear what the purpose of the code is. It seems to be a part of a data analysis project, possibly related to data quality and integrity checks, and statistical tests for data drift.

    However, the code you provided is not complete and it's missing some parts. For example, the code for calculating Total Variation Distance (TVD) is not provided.

    If you want to calculate TVD, you would need to implement it from scratch or use a library that already provides it. The code for calculating TVD is not provided in the provided code.

    If you want to add TVD to your project, you would need to implement it. This could be done by creating a function that calculates TVD, and then adding this function to your test suite.

    If you have a specific question or need help with a specific part of the code, please provide more details.
