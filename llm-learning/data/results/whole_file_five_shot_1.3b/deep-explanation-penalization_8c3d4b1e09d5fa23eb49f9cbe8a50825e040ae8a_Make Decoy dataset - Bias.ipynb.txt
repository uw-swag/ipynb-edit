    The code you've provided is a collection of Python scripts that perform various tasks such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Here's a brief overview of what each section does:

1. **Importing necessary libraries and modules**: This section imports the necessary libraries and modules for the project.

2. **Setting random seed**: This section sets a seed for the random number generator, which is used for reproducibility.

3. **Defining word pair and replace word**: This section defines the word pair and the word to be replaced.

4. **Loading and preparing the SST dataset**: This section loads the SST dataset and prepares it for use in the model.

5. **Creating decoy datasets**: This section creates decoy datasets by replacing certain words in the original dataset.

6. **Calculating the ratio of positive and negative examples**: This section calculates the ratio of positive and negative examples in the filtered datasets.

7. **Saving the filtered datasets**: This section saves the filtered datasets to a CSV file.

8. **Training the model**: This section trains the model on the filtered datasets.

9. **Evaluating the model**: This section evaluates the model on the test set.

10. **Saving the model**: This section saves the trained model to a file.

11. **Loading the model**: This section loads the saved model and uses it for predictions.

12. **Creating decoy datasets**: This section creates decoy datasets by replacing certain words in the original dataset.

13. **Calculating the ratio of positive and negative examples**: This section calculates the ratio of positive and negative examples in the filtered datasets.

14. **Saving the filtered datasets**: This section saves the filtered datasets to a CSV file.

15. **Training the model**: This section trains the model on the filtered datasets.

16. **Evaluating the model**: This section evaluates the model on the test set.

17. **Saving the model**: This section saves the trained model to a file.

18. **Loading the model**: This section loads the saved model and uses it for predictions.
