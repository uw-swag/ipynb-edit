    This notebook contains the implementation of several machine learning algorithms, including clustering, image processing, and data augmentation. The notebook also includes a description of how to use the AtomAI library for atomistic simulations.

    The notebook is divided into several sections, each of which includes a brief description of the code and the purpose of the section. The code is organized in a way that makes it easy to understand and follow along with the notebook.

    The notebook also includes a description of the AtomAI library, which is used for atomistic simulations. The AtomAI library is a Python library that provides tools for atomistic simulations, including the creation of lattice masks and the extraction of patches from images.

    The notebook also includes a description of how to use the train_test_split function from sklearn, which is used to split the data into a training set and a test set.

    The notebook also includes a description of how to use the Google Colab platform, which is a cloud-based platform for data science and machine learning. The notebook uses the drive.mount function to mount the Google Drive, which allows the notebook to access files stored on Google Drive.

    The notebook also includes a description of how to use the numpy library, which is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

    The notebook also includes a description of how to use the matplotlib library, which is a plotting library for the Python programming language. The notebook uses matplotlib to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

    The notebook also includes a description of how to use the sklearn library, which is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. The notebook uses the sklearn library to build machine learning models, to classify data, and to evaluate the performance of a model.

    The notebook also includes a description of how to use the gdown library, which is a command-line utility for downloading files from Google Drive. The notebook uses the gdown library to download files from Google Drive.

    The notebook also includes a description of how to use the atomai library, which is a Python library for atomistic simulations. The notebook uses the
