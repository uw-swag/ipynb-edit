    The function `read_and_store_data` is designed to read and store data from an EDF file. The EDF file contains data from different channels of the eye tracker. The function reads the EDF file, extracts the data from the specified channels, and stores it in a pandas DataFrame.

    The function uses the `pyedflib` library to read the EDF file, and the `numpy` library to handle the data. The function also uses the `pathlib` library to handle the file paths.

    The function reads the EDF file, extracts the data from the specified channels, and stores it in a pandas DataFrame. The DataFrame contains the data from all the patients.

    The function returns the DataFrame, which is a pandas DataFrame that contains the data from all the patients.

    The function is called by passing the path to the dataset folder and the sample rate.
