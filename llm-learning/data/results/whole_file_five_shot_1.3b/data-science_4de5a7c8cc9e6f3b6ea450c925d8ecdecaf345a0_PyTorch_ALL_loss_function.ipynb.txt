    This code is a collection of Python and PySpark code snippets. The code is used for a machine learning model training using PySpark and PyTorch. The code is divided into several cells for better readability and understanding. 

    The first cell imports necessary libraries. The next cell creates a SparkSession, which is a high-level interface for interacting with Spark. The next cell reads a CSV file into a DataFrame, which is a distributed collection of data. The next cell defines a function to calculate the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of a model's predictions. The next cell defines a function to calculate the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss. The next cell defines a function to calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss. The next cell defines a function to calculate the Hinge Embedding Loss. The next cell defines a function to calculate the Margin Ranking Loss. The next cell defines a function to calculate the Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence loss. The next cell defines a function to calculate the Triplet Margin Loss. The next cell defines a function to calculate the KL Divergence loss.

    The last cell is an example of a PySpark code snippet that uses PyTorch to define a model and train it.

    Please note that the code snippets are written in a way that they can be run in a Jupyter notebook. The code snippets are not executable and can't be run in a normal Python environment.
