    The code you provided is a Jupyter notebook that includes several cells. Here's a brief explanation of what each cell does:

1. `<Cell_0>`: This cell installs the mlxtend library, which is used for frequent pattern mining.

2. `<Cell_1>`: This cell imports the necessary libraries and defines a function to get a list of recipe links.

3. `<Cell_2>`: This cell defines a function to get a list of ingredients from a chef's recipe details.

4. `<Cell_3>`: This cell splits each ingredient into its constituent parts and stores them in a list.

5. `<Cell_4>`: This cell prints the first four ingredients.

6. `<Cell_5>`: This cell counts the total number of ingredients.

7. `<Cell_6>`: This cell identifies unique and duplicate ingredients.

8. `<Cell_7>`: This cell prints the number of unique ingredients and duplicates.

9. `<Cell_8>`: This cell cleans the ingredients by removing anything that's not a letter. It also splits ingredients into two parts and counts the occurrences of each ingredient.

10. `<Cell_9>`: This cell gets the 2nd ingredient.

11. `<Cell_10>`: This cell prints the length of the cleaned ingredients.

12. `<Cell_11>`: This cell creates a subset of the cleaned ingredients.

13. `<Cell_12>`: This cell converts the cleaned ingredients into a one-hot encoded format.

14. `<Cell_13>`: This cell prints the first 10 rows of the one-hot encoded data.

15. `<Cell_14>`: This cell performs the Apriori algorithm on the one-hot encoded data.

16. `<Cell_15>`: This cell prints the top 10 frequent ingredients.

17. `<Cell_16>`: This cell prints the top 5 frequent ingredients with a support of 0.125 or higher.

18. `<Cell_17>`: This cell prints the top 5 frequent ingredients
