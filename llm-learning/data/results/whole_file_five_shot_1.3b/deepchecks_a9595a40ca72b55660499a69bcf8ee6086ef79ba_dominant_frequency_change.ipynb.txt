The commit message "fixing docs (#898)" suggests that the code is now correctly documenting the process of creating a new check for the DominantFrequencyChange class. 

The original code was not provided, but I can provide a general explanation of what the code is doing.

The code is importing necessary libraries and modules. It then loads the iris dataset from sklearn.datasets. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set.

The code then creates a new Dataset object for the training set and a validation set. The validation set is created by duplicating some of the data in the test set.

Finally, the code creates a new check for the DominantFrequencyChange class and runs it on the validation set.

The check is a method that checks for changes in the dominant frequency of a categorical feature. If the dominant frequency of a categorical feature is less than 50%, the check will flag the data point as having a change in the dominant frequency.

The code is not complete and does not run, as the check is not being used in the code.
