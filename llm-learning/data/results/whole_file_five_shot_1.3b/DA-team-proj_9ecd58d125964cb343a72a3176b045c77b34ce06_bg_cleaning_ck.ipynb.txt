    ## Project Notes

    This project is a part of the course "Deep Learning" at the University of California, San Diego. The main goal of this project is to implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning library.

    The project involves several key steps:

    1. **Data Preprocessing**: This includes loading the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is a widely used dataset for image classification tasks. The dataset is then preprocessed by normalizing the pixel values and adding a bias dimension.

    2. **Model Implementation**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is implemented using TensorFlow. The model consists of several layers, including convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

    3. **Training**: The model is trained on the preprocessed CIFAR-10 dataset. The training process involves defining the loss function and optimizer, and then running the training loop.

    4. **Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated on the test set to measure its performance.

    The project also includes a section for tuning hyperparameters, comparing different learning rates and regularization strengths, and visualizing the learned weights for each class.

    The project is expected to demonstrate the understanding of deep learning concepts, as well as the application of TensorFlow in implementing CNNs.
