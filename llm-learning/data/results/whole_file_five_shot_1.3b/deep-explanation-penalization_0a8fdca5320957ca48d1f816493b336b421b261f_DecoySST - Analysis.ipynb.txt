The code you've provided is adding a new folder named "dataset" to the project directory. This folder will contain the datasets used in the project. The datasets used in this project are:

1. The MovieLens dataset, which is a collection of datafiles for the MovieLens database, which is a large-scale recommender system benchmark dataset.

2. The MovieLens 100k dataset, which is a subset of the MovieLens dataset.

3. The MovieLens 1M dataset, which is a subset of the MovieLens dataset.

4. The MovieLens 20M dataset, which is a subset of the MovieLens dataset.

The datasets are loaded into the project using the `movielens.load_pandas_df` function, which returns a pandas DataFrame containing the data.

The datasets are used in the following cells:

- `df = movielens.load_pandas_df(size=MOVIELENS_DATA_SIZE, header=["userID", "itemID", "rating", "timestamp"])`: This line loads the specified size of the MovieLens dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

- `train, test = python_random_split(df)`: This line splits the DataFrame into a training set and a test set. The test set is used to evaluate the performance of the recommender system.

- `data = RLRMCdataset(train=train, test=test)`: This line creates an instance of the RLRMCdataset class, which is used to load the data into the recommender system.

- `model = RLRMCalgorithm(rank = rank_parameter, C = regularization_parameter, model_param = data.model_param, initialize_flag = initialization_flag, maxiter=maximum_iteration, max_time=maximum_time)`: This line creates an instance of the RLRMCalgorithm class, which is used to train the recommender system.

- `model.fit(data,verbosity=verbosity)`: This line trains the recommender system.

- `model.predict([60586,52681],[54775,36519])`: This line makes
